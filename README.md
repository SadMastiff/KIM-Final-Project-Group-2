# Walk2Work Wellness Desk: Research Data Collecting

## Executive Summary

This project gathered actionable insights to support the marketing and development of the **Walk2Work Wellness Desk**, a treadmill-integrated workstation. We focused on three main questions:

- Who are the primary target demographics for walking treadmills?
- What features and price points are customers most interested in?
- What does health research say about the benefits of walking?

### Methods

We used AI tools (LLaMA 3 via Ollama) and Python libraries (`httpx`, `BeautifulSoup4`, `loguru`, and Biopython’s `Entrez`) to extract and analyze data from:
- Reddit (user discussions on walking desks and remote work)
- Amazon (treadmill product listings and customer reviews)
- PubMed (medical abstracts)

### Key Findings

- **Target Demographics:** Remote workers, seniors, individuals with back pain, and people with Parkinson’s disease are prime markets.
- **Desired Features:** Remote control, quiet operation, compact design, foldability, incline capability, and under-desk compatibility.
- **Health Messaging:** Emphasizing fat-burning and low-impact benefits increases product appeal. Custom walking goals based on age, sex, and BMI further improve engagement.

### Outcome

The analysis provides data-driven guidance to the Walk2Work Wellness Desk team, offering a clearer understanding of the most promising audiences and features for strategic marketing and product refinement.
