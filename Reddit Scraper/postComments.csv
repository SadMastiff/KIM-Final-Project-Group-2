devsfan1830,I would at the very least ziptie it down tight. I looks like you are already getting layer separation on that left one. The stronger way would have been to design something you could print on its side so layers would end up vertical when mounted like this.,92,93,92
dbmeed,"For just walking I donÔøΩt expect itÔøΩll move much, but yeah for running IÔøΩll strap it down. This is just a super quick design to get something I can use right away; I need to iterate it a bit. Next design will hopefully fix that, and also I need to figure out a way that I can still fold it up",27,28,27

katielovestrees,"I bought a walking pad for myself as a Christmas present and I use it almost every workday, usually 30m-1h in the morning and 30m-1h in the afternoon. When I am not using it I alternate between sit/stand positions. I find it easiest to use when I have simple, repetitive tasks to perform, or when listening to meetings where I am not required to present or speak very much. There is a bit of an adjustment period to using mouse and keyboard, and I don't recommend it for precision mouse work like screenshots. If you care about step count (it doesn't sound like it), I don't recommend it for writing tasks either, only because you have to keep your watch arm loose by your side for steps to record.

shouldimove777,all I can say is good luck. If there was one like that on the market you would see everyone buying it. their is a fundamental problem with all the walking pads on the market at the moment is that the engines are to underpowered and the air ports/vents are almost always underneath instead of on the side which basically chokes the engine into overheating and dying. Also most of them are cheaply made in China thus why you can get them as cheap as $100.¬†,1,2,1

buttfacedmiscreant11,"I have one. Used it consistently for the first 2-3 months over winter. I found it easier to work while walking than I anticipated. It's not suitable for tasks that require anything above maybe 70% concentration, but brilliant for stuff that requires less than that - I find I concentrate better and get less distracted because that extra 30% plus of my attention goes into walking, rather than my mind wandering off. Can't really use it for camera on meetings because most people find you bopping up and down distracting. It's also a bit of a faff to set up if you can't have it permanently out - I lived in a tiny house and worked out of our living room. It lived under the sofa, and it was really heavy and awkward getting it out and in place. I had a desk riser stand to balance on our dining table and the whole set up was just a bit cumbersome. I found that if I only had a couple of hours work I could do while walking I just wouldn't bother, but would bother if most of my day I could walk. It also took over pretty much the entire living room so I felt I could only use it when I was home alone, and my husband used to WFH three days a week.",32,33,32

When I was looking to purchase a walking pad I found out they apparently are supposed to be stored flat, not upright, not on their side, and without excessive weight stored on top. In my opinion, that leaves one with extremely limited storage options as it would only fit underneath a bed, probably not a couch (at least not mine). While it's ""movable"" it's honestly a chore to move it around and to get the placement at my desk just right so it's become a permanent fixture at my desk. Also good to know, if you intend to use it to keep up with your 20k steps a day, you are going to need a sturdy model.

Graham76782,"One of the best purchases I've ever made. I'm over 60lbs over the max weight of the one I got and it still works great.  On 1.5 MPH I can easily work while walking. For boring meetings or work I don't have to think too hard about I get up and walk. Can even put it in faster speeds in those cases. The science is in, lymph node fluid doesn't pump through the body like blood, it relies on movement. Even if you're using a good posture chair and a desk that switches from sitting to standing, you're not moving enough to be healthy. It's such a no brainer to use a desk treadmill. Really it's not even expensive if you consider the purchase long-term. Only one upfront cost for something you can use everyday and protect your most valuable asset, your health. The one I got has a 5 degree tilt was increases the workout. I also have grip strenghtening gear at my work desk.",0,1,0

This surprised me because I could hear my neighbor below me hacking up a lung 24/7. I really think it's because we have a heavy duty treadmill so our impact is absorbed back into the deck/frame of the treadmill before it's heard on the floor. I'm still worried about using the treadmill in the early hours because I don't want to be that annoying neighbor, and I can't run on it because the electricity in this apartment can't handle it so the circuit gets tripped constantly.

The handheld controller displayed a blue light for every button I pushed but no response. I have to conclude that the electronics was damaged. I have images of the damaged equipment and Styrofoam packaging. I went to Amazon and they sent me a shipping label with no postage and told me to take it to the US postal service. They refused to take it because of the size. I took it to UPS and shipped it and it cost me $156.74. Fedex stated in their claim instructions that the payer of the original shipment must send me a waiver for my shipping cost. ‚ÄúFor FedEx Express & FedEx Ground: If the party filing the claim is not the shipper or the payor of transportation charges to FedEx, customer must obtain and provide a claim filing waiver from the Shipper (on company letterhead if the shipper is a company).‚Äù",0,1,0

I also do a more intense 30‚Äì45-minute workout before work, either running (on my regular treadmill, not my walking pad) or weight training, so I can‚Äôt say whether a walking pad could fully replace a higher-intensity workout, it really depends on your goals. That said, it‚Äôs definitely beneficial for increasing blood flow, keeping muscles loose, decreasing pain, and helping with overall concentration. However, it won‚Äôt provide the same mental health benefits as fully disconnecting for a workout will, nor will it burn a significant number of calories unless you‚Äôre using it for an extended period.",2,3,2

Anonymous77,If you hold onto the bars the Watch switches to using your heart rate and age to calculate your steps.

This means if I was walking during the meeting, I would be slightly moving/bobbing up and down‚Äîit‚Äôs visually distracting and I didn‚Äôt want to do that during meetings. Other people might not care but I felt self-conscious about it. So, I couldn‚Äôt use it during meetings and when I‚Äôm doing solo focus work, I don‚Äôt want to be walking as it is jarring to my vision as I type and read. Basically, I found it impossible to fit into my work situation so I sold it. Instead, I schedule meetings as ‚Äúspeedy meetings‚Äù so they are 50 minutes instead of a full hour. That lets me take a 5-7 min walk outside between meetings.

snarfpod,"I‚Äôve used a treadmill desk for two years, and I love it. I already had a standing desk, and got a goyouth treadmill to go under it. The thing is, we are (or at least some people are) capable of thinking and walking (biking + working does not work as well imo)‚Äîand it sometimes helps with the thinking process. Most of my work is coding, and I can usually walk while doing that. Some days I‚Äôll take a few ten min walk breaks while doing light work or reading, some days I‚Äôll be super productive while walking for over an hour. While it doesn‚Äôt replace cardio, it‚Äôs a really great way to increase your overall activity level, and avoid pain from excess sitting or standing. I would recommend taking it slow as you start out, listen to your body and needs. If you‚Äôre not in the mood to walk, but you‚Äôre feeling productive, don‚Äôt feel guilty about not walking. If you‚Äôre in a procrastination mode, try walking while working on a straightforward task. ",12,13,12

winterbird,"I don't have a walking pad so I can't speak to what's good. But just a note on the one in your link. It says that the highest setting is 75db. That's about the noise level of a vacuum cleaner. But it also says that this is ""under no-load conditions"". Which I assume means when it's running without a person on it. It's probably a bit louder with someone on it.",2,3,2
Ohboyuh,Thanks for the suggestion. Did not realize how loud it is. Maybe if I have a fan on it would muffle it out? Idk. Will keep looking..,1,2,1
winterbird,"I think it depends on why the noise is an issue and how good you are at blocking it out. If it's for downstairs neighbors, you could set a vacuum down on the floor in your intended spot and ask if they can hear it. Maybe the walking pad company would have a breakdown on how loud the other settings are, and also how loud they are with a person on it.",1,2,1

IntellegentIdiot,Isn't there a bar in the front to hold onto if you don't want to use the poles? There was on the ellipticals I've used and you could lean on that while you hold the pad rather than hold the bar,1,2,1
SixFtTwelve,"Not on mine. The only thing in front of me is my digital readout and that's too low and too far in front to lean on while holding a controller.
