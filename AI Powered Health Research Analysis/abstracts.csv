Obstacle circumvention is an important task for community ambulation that is 
challenging to replicate in research and clinical environments. Omnidirectional 
treadmills combined with virtual reality (ODT-VR) offer a promising solution, 
allowing users to change walking direction and speed while walking in large, 
simulated environments. However, the extent to which such a setup yields 
circumvention strategies representative of overground walking in the real world 
(OVG-RW) remains to be determined. This study examined obstacle circumvention 
strategies in ODT-VR versus OVG-RW and measured how they changed with practice. 
Fifteen healthy young individuals walked while avoiding an interferer, 
performing four consecutive blocks of trials per condition. Distance at onset 
trajectory deviation, minimum distance from the interferer, and walking speed 
were compared across conditions and blocks. In ODT-VR, larger clearances and 
slower walking speeds were observed. In contrast, onset distances and 
proportions of right-side circumvention were similar between conditions. Walking 
speed increased from the first to the second block exclusively. Results suggest 
the use of a cautious locomotor behavior while using the ODT-VR setup, with some 
key features of circumvention strategies being preserved. Although ODT-VR setups 
offer exciting prospects for research and clinical applications, consideration 
should be given to the generalizability of findings to the real world.

Introduction Arm swing during walking plays an important role in reducing energy 
expenditure and enhancing motor control. Arm swing has been traditionally 
considered to occur due to passive factors associated with spinal rotational 
movements. However, the relationship between arm swing angles and rotational 
angles at each spinal level remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to 
investigate the relationship between arm swing angles and spinal rotation angles 
at each level. Methods A total of 21 young, healthy males were included in this 
study. Measurements were performed during steady-state walking on a treadmill 
(Split R, SENSTYLE Ltd., Kumamoto, Japan) at a controlled speed. The spine was 
divided into four levels using a three-dimensional motion analysis system (VICON 
MX-T, Vicon Motion Systems Ltd., Oxford, UK): upper thoracic (T1-T7), lower 
thoracic (T7-L1), upper lumbar (L1-L3), and lower lumbar (L3-S). The system 
calculated the horizontal plane rotation angles at these levels during one gait 
cycle and the sagittal plane rotation angles of the lateral epicondyles of the 
left and right upper arms as arm swing angles. Statistical analysis was 
performed to compare differences in arm swing angles between the left and right 
arms and in rotation angles between the spinal levels. Additionally, correlation 
analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between arm swing angles and 
spinal rotation angles at each level. Results The left arm swing angle was 
significantly greater than the right arm swing angle. The rotation angle at the 
T1-T7 level was the lowest among all levels. Additionally, the analysis of the 
relationship between arm swing angles and spinal rotation angles revealed that 
the left arm swing angle was significantly positively correlated with the L3-S 
angle. Conclusions Although the lower lumbar vertebrae influence left arm swing 
during steady-state walking, arm swing is not entirely dependent on the 
rotational movement of the entire spine and may be influenced by multiple other 
factors.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of submaximal interval training on 
anthropometric measurements, endurance, and flexibility of lower back and 
hamstrings in people with sedentary lifestyle.
METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was employed in this study involving 20 
sedentary participants (12 females and eight males mean age: 27.20±8.48. The 
study conducted at Physical Therapy gym Khyber Medical University Peshawar from 
January 2019 to June 2019. Over four weeks, participants underwent a submaximal 
interval training program, comprising treadmill walking or running at 70-80% of 
their maximum heart rate for one minute, followed by one minute of active 
recovery conducted three time weekly. Assessments comprised of endurance VO2 max 
using the Bruce Protocol, flexibility of the lower back extensors and hamstring 
muscles through the Young Man Christian Association (YMCA) sit and reach test, 
body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR).
RESULTS: The submaximal interval training intervention yielded significant 
improvements in endurance VO2 max, (p=0.001), flexibility (p=0.001) and BMI 
(p=0.016). However, the waist-hip ratio did not show any significant changes, 
mean pre-score (0.83±0.95) remaining the same in the post-score (0.83±0.93) 
(p=0.64).
CONCLUSION: The submaximal interval training intervention demonstrated a high 
level of tolerance, as evidenced by a remarkable adherence rate of 91% among 
participants. Moreover, this training approach exhibited significant 
enhancements in various physical parameters.

Postmenopausal women often experience fatigue and mood disturbance both of which 
interfere with quality-of-life. Since greater physical function aids 
psychosocial well-being, we hypothesized the acute cardiopulmonary responses 
during walking may reveal important factors linked to fatigue and mood 
disturbance. In this cross-sectional study, women of similar body mass index 
(BMI) aged 55-75 y were dichotomized to mid-life (55-65 y; 83.4 ± 8.4 kg/m2; 
n = 14) or older (≥65 y; 81.8 ± 10.4 kg/m2; n = 11) groups. A 6-minute walk test 
was used to estimate peak aerobic capacity (V̇O2peak). A treadmill task coupled 
with indirect calorimetry measured mean response time (MRT) - representing the 
duration to reach 63 % of steady-state net oxygen uptake (V̇O2). Average daily 
fatigue and fatigue interference were measured with the Fatigue Symptom 
Inventory. General mood disturbance was measured with the Profile of Mood States 
(POMS) questionnaire. Age-group differences were not detected in fatigue 
ratings, MRT, or walking net V̇O2. However, older women had lower aerobic 
capacity (p = 0.002, ES = 1.39) and greater disturbance in the POMS 
Depression-Dejection subscale (p = 0.042, ES = 0.41). Among all participants, 
and independent of V̇O2peak, MRT correlated with average daily fatigue 
(r = 0.500, p = 0.015), fatigue interference (r = 0.421, p = 0.046), and POMS 
total mood disturbance (rs = 0.437, p = 0.037). Regression modeling revealed MRT 
and walking net V̇O2 jointly explained 55 % (R = 0.744, p < 0.001) of the 
variance in average daily fatigue. In conclusion, MRT and walking net V̇O2 may 
serve as important points of intervention to alleviate fatigue and mood 
disturbance in postmenopausal women.

The use of 3D marker-based motion analysis systems is considered the gold 
standard for tracking limb movements. However, these systems are expensive, 
limited to laboratory settings, and difficult to apply when studying paediatric 
populations. Therefore, this study investigated the validity of a markerless 
motion tracking software, DeepLabCut, in extracting kinematics from 2D sagittal 
plane videos of adults and toddlers during walking. Data were obtained from 
fifteen toddlers performing their first independent steps and sixteen healthy 
adults. Participants performed overground and treadmill walking at comfortable 
pace. Distinct models with either 25% or 75% of participants as input were used 
for DeepLabCut network training. For all participants, anatomical landmarks 
extracted through video analysis in DeepLabCut were used to calculate lower-limb 
gait kinematics, which were compared to kinematics computed using a 3D 
marker-based system (Vicon). The 25% models performed well for adult joint 
angles, but not for clinical parameters or toddlers. In both populations, the 
75% models showed good (≥0.60) or excellent (≥0.75) intraclass correlation 
coefficient absolute agreement for most time-normalized joint angles and 
clinical parameters. This improvement was supported by increased Pearson's 
correlation coefficients, decreased root mean squared errors, and increased R2 
values from the 25% to the 75% models. More specifically, higher validity of 
DeepLabCut was found for adults compared to toddlers and treadmill compared to 
overground walking. Altogether, with sufficiently diverse input, DeepLabCut 
proved a valid tool to acquire gait kinematics in known scenarios, with the 
potential to study typical adult and toddler gait in more ecological and 
naturalistic environments.

Medical School, Mersin, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Biomechanical changes in individuals with pes planus may lead to 
unusual gait and increased muscle activity. This study aimed to investigate and 
compare walking oxygen consumption in individuals with pes planus and control 
participants.
METHODS: The study included 60 individuals (18-33 years old): 30 in the pes 
planus group (21 females) and 30 in the normal arch group (23 females) based on 
the navicular drop test and the Foot Posture Index. Individuals walked on a 
treadmill for 7 min at preferred walking speed and 30% above preferred walking 
speed, and oxygen consumption was measured through walking trials with an 
indirect calorimeter. The Borg scale was applied to determine perceived exertion 
during both walking trials. The Foot Function Index (FFI) and the Foot and Ankle 
Outcome Score (FAOS) were used to evaluate the clinical/functional status of the 
individuals with pes planus.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in preferred walking speed and 
oxygen consumption parameters for both walking trials between groups (P > .05). 
The median (range) FFI score of the individuals with pes planus was 9.13 
(0-44.35) for the right foot and 8.70 (0-40.87) for the left foot. Perceived 
exertion rates of both walking trials were not significantly different between 
groups (P > .05). The median total FAOS score of the participants with pes 
planus was 94 (range, 65-99). There were no relationships between oxygen 
consumption and FAOS and FFI scores (P > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: No differences in walking speed and walking economy parameters were 
observed between individuals with pes planus and control participants.

Basal cortisol concentration is used to screen for hypoadrenocorticism (HAD) in 
dogs with chronic gastrointestinal disease, but low values often lead to 
unnecessary ACTH stimulation tests. This study evaluated treadmill exercise as a 
potential alternative method for stimulating cortisol release. Nineteen healthy 
pet dogs (mean age: 5.2 years, median weight: 23.4 kg) were included. After a 
baseline blood draw (T0), dogs were acclimated to a treadmill with treats to 
minimize stress. They then walked and trotted for 10 min, followed by a 30 min 
rest before a second blood draw (T1). Pre- and post-treadmill exercise cortisol 
levels were compared using a randomization (permutation) test for paired data. 
Median pre-exercise serum cortisol was 1.36 μg/dL (IQR: 0.9-2.095), and 
post-exercise was 1.1 μg/dL (IQR: 0.895-1.585), with no significant difference 
(p = 0.0915). After exercise cortisol increased in 9 of 19 and decreased in 10 
of 19 dogs. These findings suggest that treadmill exercise for 10 min does not 
reliably stimulate cortisol release, assessed 30 min post-exercise. Basal 
cortisol concentrations in this cohort of clinically healthy dogs were lower 
than previously described.

Background/Objectives: One of the primary goals of neurorehabilitation after 
stroke is gait reeducation, as it provides the patient with greater autonomy and 
enhances their safety in daily activities. A preliminary clinical study was 
undertaken to determine whether robotic gait reeducation using the Lokomat 
device is more effective than conventional therapy in achieving gait symmetry. 
Methods: The research group consisted of 107 patients, with an average age of 
63.54 years, all in the subacute stage of hemiparesis. These patients underwent 
4 weeks of neurorehabilitation and were assigned into experimental and control 
groups. The patients in the experimental group underwent neurorehabilitation (20 
sessions) and twice-weekly walking on the Lokomat device (10 sessions). The 
control group received equivalent neurorehabilitation and conventional gait 
reeducation. We monitored the return of ideal limb loading (to a 50:50 ratio) 
and the restoration of the step length on the paretic limb to a physiological 
length (73 cm), as well as the subsequent restoration of gait symmetry. The 
measurements were performed using the HP Cosmos Zebris Treadmill FDM-T device. 
The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was conducted within each group to analyze the 
effectiveness of gait reeducation before and after therapy. To compare the 
results between the two groups, the Mann-Whitney test (α = 0.05) was employed. 
Results: There was no significant difference between the robotic and 
conventional therapy groups (p = 0.432 (>0.05)). A significant change occurred 
only in the control group in the 50:50 limb loading parameter (p = 0.042). There 
were no significant changes in the other parameters. Conclusions: Under the 
conditions of our study, robot-guided gait reeducation did not appear to be more 
effective than conventional therapy. The monthly duration of gait reeducation is 
insufficient to achieve a symmetrical gait in patients with spastic hemiparesis.

BACKGROUND: Regular walking has been reported to improve 
metabolically-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) by altering the 
metabolic environment. However, no studies to date have focused on older 
individuals in both conditions. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the 
effects of a 12-week walking intervention on metabolic syndrome risk factors, 
liver function indicators, and liver ultrasound findings in older adults with 
both metabolic syndrome and MASLD.
METHODS: A total of 66 participants aged 65-85 years had average ages, heights, 
and weights of 75.3 ± 5.8 years, 159.3 ± 9.3 cm, and 68.6 ± 6.8 kg, 
respectively. The participants resided in four senior living communities, and 
their diets were uniform. The participants from two facilities were assigned to 
the control group (CON, n = 33), whereas those from the other two facilities 
were allocated to the treadmill walking program group (WPG, n = 33). Each group 
comprised 13 males and 20 females. The intervention consisted of a low- to 
moderate-intensity walking program, conducted for 30 min per day, 6 days per 
week, totaling 180 min per week. The total daily calorie expenditure was 
recorded based on the values calculated from the treadmill. The walking 
intensity was adjusted by modifying the treadmill incline according to each 
participant's heart rate corresponding to their maximal oxygen consumption 
(VO₂max). The exercise intensity was set at 50% on Mondays and Fridays, 60% on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 70% on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Sundays were 
designated as rest days.
RESULTS: Although there were no significant differences in caloric intake 
between the groups, the WPG exhibited a 52.5% increase in physical activity 
levels (p < 0.001), resulting in significant reductions in body weight (-10.2%), 
fat mass (-17.2%), and abdominal fat (-4.8%). The WPG showed a 16.1% increase in 
VO₂max, along with significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (-9.6%) and 
blood glucose (-16.9%), as well as notable improvements in lipid profiles 
(p < 0.001). The WPG also demonstrated significant reductions in aspartate 
aminotransferase (-40%), alanine aminotransferase (-23.5%), total protein 
(-14.4%), albumin (-8.1%), bilirubin (-17.6%), and liver ultrasound scores 
(-31.8%), with all changes showing significant intergroup differences 
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Along with a consistent diet, a 12-week walk has been shown to 
induce significant changes in the body composition and cardiometabolic factors 
of older adults, as well as notable improvements in liver function markers and 
imaging findings.

Flat foot is a common condition marked by the collapse of the medial 
longitudinal arch, leading to altered lower limb biomechanics and increased risk 
of musculoskeletal injuries. We aimed to investigate if wide step width changes 
the lower limb inter-joint coordination and its variability in flat feet 
individuals. Twenty flat-footed individuals participated in this cross-sectional 
study. Lower limb kinematics were assessed by 3-dimensional motion analysis 
during walking and running on a treadmill with preferred and wide step widths 
while receiving visual feedback. Inter-joint coordination was quantified using 
vector-coding for joint angles in the hip, knee, and ankle. Wide walking showed 
a shift towards proximal joint motion in sagittal ankle-knee coordination during 
loading response during LR (p=0.006), an In-phase motion in transverse ankle-hip 
coordination during push-off (p=0.004), and an In-phase pattern in frontal 
knee-hip coordination during mid-stance (p=0.027). Frontal ankle and transverse 
knee coordination during push-off changed to In-phase (p=0.003). Wide running 
significantly shifted frontal ankle-hip coordination towards proximal joint 
motion during mid-stance (p=0.05). Transverse ankle-hip coordination showed an 
in-phase pattern in wide conditions during push-off (p=0.044), during LR 
(p=0.022). Wide walking, significantly increased coordination variability of the 
sagittal ankle-knee during LR and decreased transverse ankle-hip during 
push-off. Wide walking significantly increased coordination variability in 
ankle-knee in sagittal plane during LR (p<0.001). Wide running significantly 
decreased the coordination variability in the ankle-knee sagittal during LR 
(p<0.001) and knee-hip sagittal during LR (p=0.007) and push-off (p=0.016). The 
results showed that wide step width can affect inter-joint coordination during 
walking/running in flat-footed individuals at certain points. These results 
should be considered when using a wide step width as a gait retraining method 
for managing flat-footed individuals.

Preferred and maximum walking speeds decline as we age and the decline has been 
associated with worsening health. Slowing of gait in older individuals is 
correlated with biomechanical and neural factors, but historically it has been 
difficult to measure whole-brain activity during walking. Recent advances in 
mobile brain imaging with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) allow for 
separation and localization of electrical brain activity during walking. We 
studied younger (N=31) and older adults (N=59) walking on a treadmill at 
different speeds (0.25-1.0 m/s) while we recorded electrocortical dynamics with 
EEG. We hypothesized that faster walking speeds would result in greater 
sensorimotor and posterior parietal theta band (4-7 Hz) spectral power and lower 
beta band (13-30 Hz) spectral power compared to slower walking speeds for older 
adults, consistent with previous studies on younger adults. Additionally, we 
used a standardized test of physical function to group older adults into high 
functioning [Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB≥10] and low functioning 
(SPPB<10) groups for comparison. In agreement with our hypotheses, sensorimotor 
and posterior parietal theta power increased, and beta power decreased at faster 
walking speeds. We also found that left posterior parietal, mid cingulate, and 
cuneus exhibited differences in theta power at faster speeds between younger and 
older adults. The results suggest that older and younger adults activate 
cortical areas throughout the brain while walking at different speeds, and older 
adults, particularly those with lower mobility, recruit greater cognitive 
resources in parietal cortex compared to younger adults. These results could 
inform stimulation protocols targeting parietal cortex.

BACKGROUND: Cold exposure impairs physical performance, with the severity of 
degradation depending on the degree of cold strain. Thresholds for impairment 
and non-invasive biomarkers to identify changes have yet to be identified. 
Therefore, this study examines the effects of cold exposure on physical 
performance, thermoregulation, salivary biomarkers, and the effects of a 
short-period of rewarming.
METHODS: 14 recreationally active participants (3F, 11 M), aged 18-44 years, 
completed a randomized, crossover study involving three experimental conditions: 
20, 10, and 0 °C. For each condition, participants completed four 20-minute 
treadmill walks with physical performance tests, and a 10-minute rewarming 
period followed by another physical performance test in the respective 
condition. Physical performance was assessed via the Complete Minnesota 
Dexterity Test (CMDT), dominant and non-dominant handgrip strength (HGS) between 
the walks and after rewarming. Thermal discomfort, thermal sensation, body core 
temperature (Tc), skin temperature (Tsk), and salivary biomarkers 
(alpha-amylase, cortisol) were measured throughout the study.
RESULTS: Exposure to 0 °C caused reductions in skin temperatures, with peak 
reductions in the forearm (-10.51 ± 0.57 °C, p < 0.001) and fourth-finger skin 
temperatures (-11.60 ± 0.80 °C, p < 0.001). Declines were also found at 10 °C, 
with peak reductions in forearm (-6.69 ± 0.56 °C, p < 0.001) and fourth-finger 
skin temperatures (-8.56 ± 0.81 °C, p < 0.001), while no changes occurred at 20 
°C. Thermal discomfort and thermal sensation were lowest at 0 °C. Dexterity and 
HGS significantly declined during 0 °C and 10 °C exposures, with reductions most 
severe at 0 °C, and no declines at 20 °C. Salivary alpha-amylase and cortisol 
were not different across environmental conditions or time. Rewarming for 
10-minutes at 22 °C improved HGS, CMDT, and thermal discomfort by 30-50%.
CONCLUSIONS: Cold exposure at 0 °C and 10 °C impairs performance and a 10-minute 
period of rewarming at 23 °C partially restored performance. Potential salivary 
biomarkers were not strong predictors of impaired performance.

The effect of simultaneously performing two tasks (dual-task effects, DTEs) has 
been extensively studied, mainly focusing on the combination of cognitive and 
motor tasks. Given their potentially detrimental impact on real-life activities, 
the impact of DTEs has been investigated in both healthy individuals and 
patients. In this Registered Report, we aimed to replicate previous DTEs when a 
task requiring executive-inhibitory skills is involved while also expanding the 
evidence on basic facets of decision-making. We recruited 50 healthy young 
participants who performed a stop-signal task and two gambling tasks 
(loss-aversion and risk-aversion) while sitting and while walking at three 
treadmill speeds (normal, slow and fast). We report a significant difference in 
performance during single-task and dual-task, although with high individual 
variability. The data show no effect of the walking speed on all the cognitive 
tasks. Analyses on postural alignments, assessed in the cadence, gait cycle 
length and stance phase, confirm previous results on cognitive prioritization 
strategies of healthy individuals. Based on our results, we highlight the need 
to further investigate prioritization strategies when tasks involving higher 
cognitive functions are performed along a motor task in healthy individuals and 
patients with the aim of offering targeted training and rehabilitation 
protocols. The stage 1 protocol for this Registered Report was accepted in

BackgroundPatients with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) have gait disorders. The 
efficiency of treadmill training on walking distance is debatable.ObjectiveThis 
study evaluated the efficacy of a 6-week treadmill training program at heart 
rate at the first ventilatory threshold (HRVT1) on walking distance compared 
with a control group in PwMS.MethodsThis prospective, multicenter study included 
46 PwMS with moderate disability which randomized into training group (TG) and 
control group (CG). Patients performed cardiopulmonary exercise test to 
determine HRVT1. TG realized walking treadmill training program at HRVT1: 18 
sessions (3 sessions/week) over 6 weeks. The distance on the six-minute walk 
test (6MWT), Timed 25 foot walk, patient-reported walking ability, berg balance 
scale, fatigue scale, the HR at the end of the 6MWT (HR6MWT) were collected at 
baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.ResultsThe 6MWT distance showed a significant 
overall group effect (30.6 m; 95%CI = (6.6; 54.6); p = 0.017). The perceived 
impact of walking was significantly decreased in the TG (-6.1; 95% CI = (-9.2; 
-2.9); p = 0.0006). No correlation was found between HRVT1 and 
HR6MWT.ConclusionAerobic treadmill training significantly enhanced walking 
distance and reduced perceived walking difficulties in PwMS.

BackgroundNon-motorized treadmills have been used for health improvement in 
healthy individuals and for enhancing physical fitness in athletes. However, 
there is a lack of research focusing on their use with patients with 
stroke.ObjectiveThis study aims to assess the impact of non-motorized treadmill 
training on lower limb strength, balance, and gait in patients with stroke, and 
compare it with flat ground walking training.MethodsThe participants included 22 
patients with stroke, divided into two groups: non-motorized treadmill training 
group (n = 11) and flat ground walking training group (n = 11). All participants 
underwent 20 training sessions, 30 min each, five times a week for four weeks. 
Outcome measures included the digital dynamometer, Medical Research Council 
scale (MRC), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Four Square Step Test (FSST), 6-Minute 
Walk Test (6MWT), and GAITRite.ResultsThe non-motorized treadmill training group 
showed significant improvements compared to the flat ground walking group in hip 
abductor and extensor muscle strength, knee flexor and extensor muscle strength, 
MRC, BBS, FSST, 6MW and gait parameters (p < 0.05).ConclusionsNon-motorized 
treadmill training may be considered an effective gait rehabilitation method in 
clinical settings for patients experiencing stroke with reduced lower limb 
strength, balance, and walking ability.

Step width is a parameter that determines the size of the base of support (BOS) 
during gait. Further, it is related to the control of center of mass (COM) and 
trunk movements and gait speed. The current study aimed to validate the effect 
of conditioning using combined step width (narrow and wide) and gait speed 
(normal [4.5 km/h] and slow [2.2 km/h]) on the segmental control of the head, 
thorax, and pelvis with respect to the BOS. The behavior of the head, thorax, 
and pelvis of 17 healthy adult participants were measured during treadmill 
walking using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. If the step width was 
narrow, the whole body segment with a high contribution to COM under narrow BOS 
conditions was more likely to have a high variability. However, the mediolateral 
direction behavior was small. On the contrary, if the step width was wide, the 
whole body segment with a high contribution to COM under wide BOS conditions was 
more likely to have a low variability. Nevertheless, the mediolateral direction 
behavior was large. Regarding the intersegmental association, particularly if 
the step width was narrow and the gait speed was normal, the head showed highly 
controlled movements with minimal displacement and increased fine-tuning. The 
thorax displayed significant importance in maintaining trunk stability, 
operating within a larger range of mediolateral displacement compared to the 
head and pelvis, under three conditions, except if the step width was narrow and 
the gait speed was normal. The study underscores the significant impact of both 
step width and gait speed on the control and stability of high-mass body 
segments during gait. It suggests that narrow step widths necessitate advanced 
control strategies, while wide step widths promote simpler, compensatory 
mechanisms, especially relevant in clinical contexts.

PURPOSE: Both cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and obesity have been 
well-established as predictors of cardiometabolic risk and mortality. This study 
sought to investigate the joint association of CRF and adiposity measures with 
all-cause and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality in a cohort of patients with stable 
CVD.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the ITER registry. The sample was composed of 
2860 cardiac patients involved in an exercise-based secondary prevention program 
between 1997 and 2023. Patient CRF was estimated using the 1-km treadmill 
walking test, and measures of body mass index (BMI) and predicted body fat 
percentage (pBF%) were determined. Cox proportional hazard models were used to 
determine associations with mortality. All results were adjusted for demographic 
and clinical confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 1034 deaths (463 of CVD) occurred over a median of 11 years. 
Each of the fitness-fatness combinations was associated with an increased risk 
of mortality as compared with normal weight-fit or low pBF%-fit groups. As 
regards BMI, compared to the reference group, higher mortality risks were 
observed for overweight-unfit (HR = 1.93: 95% CI, 1.55-2.41; P < .0001), and 
obese-unfit patients (HR = 1.63: 95% CI, 1.28-2.08; P < .0001). Similar 
magnitudes were detected in the moderate pBF%-unfit (HR = 2.47: 95% CI, 
1.99-3.06) and high pBF%-unfit (HR = 2.07: 95% CI, 1.69-2.54; P < .0001) groups. 
A similar pattern was observed for CVD mortality.
CONCLUSION: While overweight and obesity have been associated with an increased 
risk of death, maintaining CRF can mitigate this risk. These findings support 
the fundamental role of CRF in exercise assessment and prescription in secondary 
prevention programs.

BACKGROUND: Overhead support or catch systems are frequently used in gait 
studies involving clinical populations to ensure participant safety. These 
systems remain slack when the participant is upright and therefore are assumed 
to not interfere with gait biomechanics. However, these systems follow 
participant's transverse motion during walking via rail systems, which could 
produce additional inertial and frictional forces that affect gait biomechanics.
OBJECTIVE: Quantify the influence of overhead support systems on gait 
biomechanics during treadmill and overground walking.
METHODS: We recruited fifteen uninjured adults to perform treadmill and 
overground walking. In each of these walking conditions, we varied each 
participant's walking speed (80, 100, and 120 % of preferred speed) and 
attachment to an overhead support system. We measured the participants' joint 
angles, moments and ground reaction forces using a three-dimensional motion 
capture system and an instrumented treadmill built into an overground walkway. 
For overground and treadmill walking, we examined changes in each biomechanical 
variable across speed and harness conditions using one-dimensional statistical 
parametric mapping (spm1d).
RESULTS: During overground walking, the overhead support system altered ground 
reaction forces, joint kinematics, and moments, and these effects became more 
pronounced with increased speed. During treadmill walking, we found very few 
changes in gait biomechanics resulting from the harness.
CONCLUSIONS: These results caution the use of experimental paradigms involving 
overground walking when an overhead support is required, although these results 
may be less pronounced in clinical populations with slower walking speeds. 
Overhead support systems can be used during treadmill walking without affecting 
biomechanical measurements.

BACKGROUND: It is unclear how activity breaks from prolonged sitting after 
aerobic exercise affects postprandial glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the acute effects of volume- and intensity-matched 
activity breaks after aerobic exercise on postprandial glucose, triglyceride, 
and cholesterol in healthy young adults.
METHODS: Randomized, single-blind, 4-period crossover trial conducted among 12 
sedentary, healthy young adults (age 22 ± 3 years). They took part in 4 
conditions of 7 hours each in random order with a washout period of at least 4 
days: (1) uninterrupted sitting for 6.5 hours after aerobic exercise (Ex-Sit); 
(2) 2-minute walking breaks from sitting every 30 minutes after aerobic exercise 
(Ex-Break2); (3) 4-minute walking breaks from sitting every 60 minutes after 
aerobic exercise (Ex-Break4); (4) 8-minute walking breaks from sitting every 120 
minutes after aerobic exercise (Ex-Break8). Aerobic exercise consisted of 30 
minutes of moderate-intensity walking on a treadmill. The total amount of 
light-intensity walking breaks was 24 minutes. Postprandial serum triglycerides, 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL-C), total cholesterol, and capillary glucose were measured over 7 hours. 
Linear mixed models were used to explore between-condition differences.
RESULTS: Non-HDL-C incremental area under the curve was significantly reduced by 
36.07 (95% CI: -69.76, -2.39) mg/dL.7 hours (P = .030) and 33.02 (95% CI: 
-65.42, -0.61) mg/dL.7 hours (P = .044) in Ex-Break4 compared to Ex-Sit and 
Ex-Break8, respectively. No significant differences were observed for the 
remaining variables.
CONCLUSION: Taking hourly 4-minute walking breaks from sitting after aerobic 
exercise can reduce postprandial non-HDL-C levels in sedentary, healthy young 
adults.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
with the ID number NCT06106464.

Despite its central role in the proper functioning of the motor system, 
sensation has been less studied than motor outputs in sensorimotor adaptation 
paradigms. This is likely due to the difficulty of measuring sensation 
non-invasively: while motor outputs have easily observable consequences, 
sensation is inherently an internal variable of the motor system. In this study, 
we investigated how well participants can sense relevant sensory stimuli that 
induce locomotor adaptation. We addressed this question with a split-belt 
treadmill, which moves the legs at different speeds. We used a two-alternative 
forced choice paradigm with multiple repetitions of various speed differences 
considering the probabilistic nature of perceptual responses. We found that the 
participants correctly identified a speed difference of 49.7 mm/s in 75% of the 
trials when walking at 1.05 m/s (i.e., 4.7% Weber Fraction). To gain insight 
into the perceptual process in walking, we applied a drift-diffusion model (DDM) 
relating the participants' identification of speed difference (i.e., stimulus 
identification) and their response time during walking. The implemented DDM was 
able to predict participants' stimulus identification for all speed differences 
by simply using the recorded reaction times to fit a single set of model 
parameters. Taken together, our results indicate that individuals can accurately 
identify smaller speed differences than previously reported and that 
participants' stimulus perception follows the evidence accumulation process 
outlined by drift diffusion models, conventionally used for short-latency, 
static sensory tasks, rather than long-latency, and motor tasks such as 
walking.Significance Statement There is limited knowledge about the sensory 
information involved in the adaptation of motor outputs during locomotion. 
Therefore, we characterized the human ability to detect speed differences 
governing sensorimotor adaptation in split-belt walking, a well-known method 
inducing locomotor adaptation. Our unique approach revealed an enhanced 
sensitivity to smaller speed differences compared to previous studies. 
Additionally, we unveiled a mechanistic relationship between stimulus 
identification and reaction times across speed differences of varying magnitudes 
in walking, using the drift-diffusion model - traditionally associated with 
short latency, static sensory tasks - thereby highlighting the generality of the 
stimulus perception process across both static and dynamic tasks.

Our previously published results have proven that low-intensity exercise, 
equivalent to brisk walking, is beneficial in managing cardiac insulin 
resistance in post-weaning male rats exposed to a fructose-rich diet. Still, its 
role in protecting against cardiac inflammation is unclear. This experiment was 
designed to investigate the preventive effect of low-intensity exercise on 
cardiac inflammation in male post-weaning rats exposed to a fructose-rich diet 
(10%). Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to a sedentary control group, a 
sedentary group with fructose overload, and a fructose overload group subjected 
to treadmill exercise for nine weeks. Protein expression of cardiac inducible 
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), matrix metalloproteinase 9, as well as cellular 
localization/phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and α1 and α2 
subunits of sodium-potassium ATPase pump (Na/K-ATPase) was determined. 
Additionally, gene expression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and suppressor 
of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) was examined. The results demonstrate that a 
chronic fructose-rich diet in sedentary rats elevates the expression of key 
inflammatory markers, including SOCS3, TNFα, NF-κB, and iNOS, as well as the 
plasma membrane α1 and α2 subunits. Exercise prevented alterations induced by a 
fructose-rich diet, except iNOS expression. Additionally, exercise increased the 
protein expression of the α1 and α2 subunits of Na/K-ATPase in the lysate of 
fructose-fed rats. These findings suggest that low-intensity exercise is an 
effective non-invasive strategy for cardioprotection, helping to prevent 
inflammation by modulating TNFα and NF-κB expression in insulin-resistant hearts 
of post-weaning male rats.

Introduction: Gait analysis plays a key role in improving our understanding of 
joint kinematics during locomotion, often by leveraging marker-based systems. 
Accessibility to marker-based systems is nevertheless limited, as they are 
usually associated with high equipment costs, large space requirements, and the 
need for lengthy data processing. These restrictions have therefore driven the 
need for tools that facilitate the interpretation and comparison of openly 
accessible kinematic datasets, even in cases where the data have been collected 
using distinct equipment and/or protocols. Methods: This study addresses 
variations in kinematic data arising from the use of different marker sets, 
focusing specifically on the tibio-femoral joint kinematics of 15 healthy 
subjects during treadmill walking. By simultaneously capturing joint motion 
using five distinct marker sets, we were able to confirm the presence of visible 
differences in the raw kinematic outputs prior to data optimisation, despite 
their representing the same underlying motion. We subsequently implemented the 
REference FRame Alignment MEthod (REFRAME) to account for signal differences 
linked to inconsistent local reference frame orientations. Results and 
Discussion: After REFRAME optimisation, improved convergence of the kinematic 
signals was observed, confirming that the differences observed in raw signals 
stemmed primarily from differing reference frame orientations, rather than 
genuine variations in joint motion. This study highlights REFRAME's potential to 
enhance comparability across biomechanical datasets, thus facilitating robust 
inter-laboratory comparisons and supporting reliable interpretations of data in 
clinical and research applications.

Osteoarthritis is one of the most frequent joint diseases in the world. 
Therefore, it is critical to develop sufficient therapy strategies to improve a 
patient's quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence 
of an individualized (custTKA) vs. a conventional (convTKA) total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA) in regard to gait, posture and clinical outcome. 
Seventy-three patients (male: n = 32, female: n = 41; age: 66.5 ± 8.64 years; 
BMI: 32.2 ± 5.68 kg/m2; axis pre-operative: 174 ± 4.65°) were included in this 
prospective controlled trial study (examinations 1, 2 and 3: preoperative, 3 and 
12 months postoperative). Two experienced senior surgeons performed the 
surgeries. Clinical results were measured using the Forgotten Knee Joint Score 
(FKJS) and Knee Society Score (KSS). Additionally, gait was measured with 
inertial sensor based mobile and treadmill based systems, while posture was 
measured with a posturographic system in order to assess gait patterns and 
postural stability, regulation and weight distribution. Radiographic evaluation 
was measured of the hip knee ankle (HKA)) at 3 and 12 months postoperative. 
There were no clinically significant interaction effects (time x group) for 
posture (e.g., stability indicator, postural subsystems) or gait (e.g., stride 
length, walking speed, double support). However, time effects were observed for 
the somatosensory system (p = 0.005, ηp2 = 0.08), medio-lateral weight 
distribution (p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.31), stride length (p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.21), 
walking speed (p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.21), cadence (p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.18), stance 
phase (p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.20) and maximum toe force (p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.24). No 
significant differences were found for KSS or FJS 3 and 12 months postoperative 
(custTKA/convTKA: KSS examination 2 179/189, p = 0.153; KSS examination 3 
206/198, p = 0.246; FKJS examination 2 41.4/40.7, p = 0.900; FKJS examination 3 
54.9/45.8, p = 0.149). Similarly, no significant differences were noted for 
flexion at 3 (113/119°, p = 0.062) and 12 months postoperative (121/122°, p = 
0.615). Radiographic diagnostic (HKA) also displayed no significant-relevant 
interaction effects. In this prospective controlled study no clinical 
significant-relevant interaction effects (group x time) were found between both 
techniques regarding biomechanical and clinical parameters. Therefore, it can be 
concluded that custTKA provides no substantial clinical benefits compared to 
convTKA.

BACKGROUND: The paraspinal muscles, such as the multifidus muscles and erector 
spinae muscles, play an important role in trunk stabilization and pelvic 
mobility during gait. Understanding how they are activated according to the 
speed of locomotion can facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of patients with 
these conditions. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the activity of 
postural muscles (multifidus and erector spinae) using surface electromyography 
(sEMG) across a range of gait speeds.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 31 students of physiotherapy at the 
Pomeranian University in Słupsk, including 20 women (64.51%) and 11 men 
(35.48%). The research process included an interview and participation in the 
sEMG survey. The sEMG examination of the musculus erector spinae (MES) and 
musculus multifidus (MM) was carried out in the supine, standing position, while 
walking on a treadmill, maintaining speeds: 1 km/h, 3 km/h, 5 km/h and 6 km/h, 
for 60 s at each stage and at maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). 
The percentage value of the amplitude of the sEMG recording in relation to 
maximum voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC) was determined. The average rate 
of change in muscle activity was also assessed in relation to the respective 
changes in locomotion speed for MES and MM.
RESULTS: The results show significant differences in the %MVIC parameter between 
sides (left vs right) for both muscle groups (MES and MM) in the supine position 
and in the standing position for the multifidus muscles. At the set speeds of 1 
km/h, 3 km/h, 5 km/h and 6 km/h, the differences are not statistically 
significant. A decreasing trend in the rate of change in muscle activity was 
also observed for both muscle groups as gait speed increased. The most 
significant decrease is observed at average gait speeds of 3-5 km/h.
CONCLUSIONS: In the sEMG examination during rest, standing and walking, the 
activity of the right and left MES and MM muscles examined is not always equal. 
The activity of the muscles studied (MES and MM) increases with increasing gait 
speed. The rate of change in muscle activity decreases as gait speed increases.

In the present study, we investigated the impact of motivational music and video 
on gait parameters in older adults with different cognitive styles. Participants 
(N = 24; M age = 68.83 years, SD = 2.61) were divided into two cognitive style 
groups: field-dependent and field-independent, based on a hidden figures test. 
Participants completed a treadmill walking task under three different conditions 
(motivational music, motivational video, and no intervention). We measured their 
step width and step length and their hip, knee, and ankle joint angles at heel 
strike and toe-off. Results showed a significant positive effect of the music 
condition on step width and stride length and hip joint angle at heel strike, 
and ankle joint angle at toe-off. There was a significant effect of group 
(cognitive style) on step width, the angle of the hip joint and the angle of the 
knee joint at toe-off; however, there was no significant group by condition 
interaction for any of the assessed variables. Thus, walking with motivational 
music improved gait parameters in older adults.

Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been widely used in human 
movement analysis outside the laboratory. However, the IMU-based orientation 
estimation remains challenging, particularly in scenarios involving relatively 
fast movements. Increased sampling rate has the potential to improve accuracy, 
but it also increases power consumption and computational complexity. The 
relationship between sampling frequencies and accuracies remains unclear. We 
thus investigated the specific influence of IMU sampling frequency on 
orientation estimation across a spectrum of movement speeds and recommended 
sufficient sampling rates. Seventeen healthy subjects wore IMUs on their thigh, 
shank, and foot and performed walking (1.2 m/s) and running (2.2 m/s) trials on 
a treadmill, and a motion testbed with an IMU was used to mimic high-frequency 
cyclic human movements up to 3.0 Hz. Four widely used IMU sensor fusion 
algorithms computed orientations at 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1600 Hz 
and were compared with marker-based optical motion capture (OMC) orientations to 
determine accuracy. Results suggest that the sufficient IMU sampling rate for 
walking is 100 Hz, running is 200 Hz, and high-speed cyclic movements is 400 Hz. 
The accelerometer sampling rate is less important than the gyroscope sampling 
rate. Further, accelerometer sampling rates exceeding 100 Hz even resulted in 
decreased accuracy because excessive orientation updates using distorted 
accelerations and angular velocity introduced more error than merely using 
angular velocity. These findings could serve as a foundation to inform wearable 
IMU development or selection across a spectrum of human gait movement speeds.

Background/Objectives: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has been used to 
improve the quality of life of patients with stroke. Rehabilitation programs 
focus on standing and walking, which are vital to functional independence and 
keystone ingredients in functional competency. To examine the effects of 
simultaneous continuous ongoing FES of gluteus medius (GMed) and tibialis 
anterior (TA) muscles at isometric contraction during standing and walking in 
patients with stroke. Methods: Short- and long-term FES management programs of 
GMed and TA muscles during different conditions have been used in patients with 
stroke. FES was applied to hip abductors and dorsiflexor muscles of the affected 
limb during four different conditions: passive hip abduction and ankle 
dorsiflexion, respectively (condition 1), sit-to-stand (condition 2), 10 m walk 
test (condition 3), and walking on C-mill treadmill (condition 4). The Modified 
Ashworth Scale (MAS), Five Times sit-to-stand test (FTSST), 10-m walk test 
(10-MWT), and C-mill treadmill were used to assess spasticity in the hip 
adductor and calf muscles, sit-to-stand performance, and temporal-spatial 
characteristics, respectively. Results: Short- and long-term FES management 
programs significantly reduced spasticity in the hip adductor and calf muscles 
and improved sit-to-stand performance, gait speed, and gait temporal-spatial 
characteristics. Conclusions: Short- and long-term FES management programs of 
GMed and TA muscles can quickly and effectively improve the spasticity and 
ambulation of patients with stroke. Further research incorporating gait analysis 
with randomized controlled samples is needed.

This study investigated cognitive-motor interference (CMI) and attentional 
resource management during development using a dual-task (DT) paradigm. 
Participants aged 7-9 years (n = 11), 10-12 years (n = 14), and adults (n = 17) 
performed an auditory oddball task with two difficulty levels while sitting or 
walking on a treadmill. Cognitive and motor performance, along with P3a and P3b 
event-related potentials, were analyzed. Results showed improved cognitive and 
motor performance with age, associated with reorganization of brain responses. 
Children exhibited larger P3a and P3b amplitudes compared to adults, suggesting 
higher attentional resource allocation. Increasing cognitive difficulty led to 
decreased cognitive performance and increased P3a amplitude in children. Motor 
complexity resulted in decreased P3b amplitude in children, indicating 
reallocation of attentional resources to gait control. Notably, children aged 
10-12 years demonstrated more adult-like CMI management strategies compared to 
younger children. The study revealed that attentional resource management 
evolves with age, with older children showing more efficient resource 
utilization despite similar resource allocation. These findings highlight the 
complex development of cognitive-motor systems and attentional resource 
management during childhood, emphasizing the importance of considering 
age-specific strategies in dual-task paradigms. The results contribute to 
understanding the developmental trajectory of CMI management and its 
implications for cognitive and motor performance in children.

OBJECTIVE: It is generally accepted that blood flow in the superficial venous 
system of the lower extremity is anterograde whether the body is at rest (lying, 
sitting, or standing) or in motion (walking). However, it has been shown that 
during locomotion, anterograde blood flow in the superficial veins from the calf 
to the thigh was not observed. Instead, the blood flowed towards the 
intramuscular veins of the lower leg. The purpose of this study was to determine 
the pressure gradient directing the blood flow in the thigh venous network 
during ambulation.
METHODS: Sixteen healthy volunteers (legs) were enrolled in the study. Venous 
pressure was measured in the great saphenous vein (GSV) at the upper and distal 
thigh and in the intermuscular vein of the posterior thigh during treadmill 
walking at 30, 45 and 60 stride cycles min-1. The blood flow rate in the common 
femoral artery (LBF, L/min) was measured by duplex ultrasound at rest and 
immediately following each exercise test.
RESULTS: Fourteen lower extremities were included in the analysis, two were 
excluded due to technical failure. A pressure gradient (PG) directed from the 
superficial to the intermuscular vein (Sv-Iv) was observed for the majority the 
stride cycle time. The magnitude of the Sv-Iv PG was found to be considerably 
higher than the pressure gradient observed between knee and groin GSV levels. 
The GSV pressure averaged over the cycle time (P̅, mmHg), was found to be 
similar at the knee and groin levels, irrespective of walking frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: During natural ambulation, the resulting pressure gradient was 
directed from superficial to intermuscular veins for the majority of the stride 
cycle time. The thigh muscle pump functions as a flow diverter pump, redirecting 
blood flow from the superficial to the intramuscular venous networks via 
perforating veins.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the impact of aquatic treadmill walking on the pelvic 
dynamics of children with cerebral palsy (CP).
DESIGN: The study is a block-randomized cross-over design with 8 children with 
CP and 15 typically developing (TD) children. All participants walked at fast, 
normal, and slow speeds on an aquatic (WET) treadmill and conventional (DRY) 
treadmill. Inertial measurement units recorded the participants' pelvic angles 
in the mediolateral, anteroposterior, and axial angles from which sample entropy 
values were determined.
RESULTS: A multilevel model showed decreased irregularity in the pelvic dynamics 
of both CP and TD groups in WET conditions compared to DRY and at slower 
compared to higher speeds in the mediolateral and axial planes. For the 
anteroposterior plane, the irregularity of the pelvic motion decreased at the 
slow speed-WET condition compared to the fast trial.
CONCLUSION: The study shows the potential of the aquatic treadmill environment 
to induce more typical postural dynamics for children with CP compared to 
conventional dry treadmills. Postural dynamics also had decreased irregularity 
at slower walking speeds. A longitudinal study would show the retention 
tendencies of observed impacts on children with CP.

Positive model rectification is a key factor in providing a comfortable and 
successful transtibial prosthetic socket fitting. This study aimed to assess 
whether a 4% compression value in 3- and 5-mm thickness affordable 
ethylene-vinyl acetate roll-on (AERO) liners yields acceptable comfort and 
pressure distribution for transtibial prosthetic users. Stump socks were used to 
adjust volume in the fitting process with a socket compressed to 4%, and 
pressure data were collected using 6 force-sensing resistor (FSR400) sensors 
placed in areas sensitive and tolerant to pressure. Peak pressure was collected 
from 40 steps, and pressure uniformity was calculated using the coefficient of 
variation in 2-min walking on the treadmill. The socket comfort score was 
collected after the trial. Appropriate compression values, pressure 
distribution, and socket comfort score were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank 
tests, and effect size was determined using Cliff's delta. The study found that 
a 4.95% compression was optimal for a 3-mm thickness liner, whereas a 4.5% 
compression suited a 5-mm liner better for comfort. Moreover, the study observed 
a small similarity in pressure distribution between liners, as indicated by 
Cliff's delta, with the 5-mm liner possibly providing more even pressure because 
of its thickness. Despite being made of the same material, liners with different 
thicknesses distribute pressure differently. Therefore, this study suggests that 
a 4% universal compression value in the affordable ethylene-vinyl acetate 
roll-on liner may be effective for use in a clinical setting. Future studies 
should include more participants to identify the appropriate compression for a 
variety of residual limbs.

OBJECTIVE: Determine acute symptomatic, gait, and biological effects of lower 
extremity loading during lower body positive pressure (LBPP) treadmill walking 
in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: Participants with knee OA (n = 32) above the age of 50 performed 
two-45-minute walking sessions at least 1 week apart. Individuals walked at 
self-selected speed on the treadmill at 100% bodyweight (BW) or 50%BW. The 
primary outcome was change in serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), 
with other outcome measures including change in knee joint pain, exercise 
intensity, gait parameters, and the concentration of other serum biomarkers of 
joint disease.
RESULTS: Across all timepoints, 50%BW walking, was associated with significant 
reductions in knee pain compared to 100%BW (p < 0.05 for all) with no 
significant difference in duration of moderate-intensity exercise. 50%BW was 
associated with significant decreases in cadence (p < 0.001) and increased 
stride length (p = 0.008). Biomarker analyses demonstrated 100%BW walking was 
associated with a significant increase in COMP at 45 minutes compared to 
baseline (p = 0.032), not observed with 50% BW.
CONCLUSION: 50%BW walking in knee OA using an LBPP treadmill acutely reduces 
joint pain, improves gait parameters, and does not increase markers of cartilage 
turnover. Future studies should investigate the longitudinal benefits of this 
rehabilitation approach.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) exhibit altered 
walking mechanics, including changes in joint movement and muscle activation 
patterns at the ankle. However, amplitude-based analyses of muscle activation 
during walking have shown inconsistent results between individuals with CAI and 
uninjured controls. Time-frequency analyses can capture transient and 
frequency-specific muscle activation patterns that amplitude-based analyses may 
overlook, offering deeper insights into muscle function during dynamic 
activities.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Do individuals with CAI demonstrate increased low-frequency 
muscle activation and decreased high-frequency activation in the time-frequency 
domain compared to uninjured individuals during walking at their self-selected 
speed?
METHODS: Nineteen individuals with CAI and 19 uninjured controls completed a 
walking trial on a force-measuring treadmill at their self-selected speed while 
electromyography sensors recorded muscle activity from the shank muscles. We 
used wavelet transformation to perform time-frequency decomposition of muscle 
activation data, then applied principal component analysis to extract unique 
signal features and compared principal component scores between groups.
RESULTS: Individuals with CAI exhibited significantly greater intensity 
magnitudes in the medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscles at low frequencies and 
reduced magnitudes at high frequencies compared to controls (p = 0.006). 
Individuals with CAI exhibited significantly larger intensity magnitudes in the 
tibialis anterior and lateral gastrocnemius across all frequencies. Those with 
CAI showed smaller intensity magnitudes in the fibularis longus muscle overall 
but had higher magnitudes at low frequencies at the onset of the stance phase.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our finding suggests that electromyography analysis in the 
time-frequency domain has the potential to reveal unique muscle function 
alterations in individuals with CAI during walking, which cannot be observed in 
traditional amplitude-based analyses.

A distal-to-proximal redistribution of joint work and reduction in ankle 
kinetics may contribute to declines in gait performance with advancing age. 
Interventions to improve ankle function could help maintain gait performance in 
old adults. Inertial measurement units are practical and inexpensive and may be 
used to provide biofeedback of foot angular velocity to improve ankle propulsive 
function during gait.
PURPOSE: This study assessed if real-time biofeedback of foot plantarflexion 
angular velocity influenced ankle kinetics and hip-to-ankle work ratio in old 
adults.
METHODS: Eight healthy old adults walked at their preferred speed (PS), maximal 
speed (MS), and MS with auditory feedback for a 5 % increase in foot 
plantarflexion velocity (AUD). Kinematic and ground reaction force data were 
collected, and joint kinetics were calculated.
RESULTS: Ankle positive work was larger during MS (p < 0.001) and AUD 
(p < 0.001) compared to PS, and 8 % larger during AUD compared to MS (p = 0.01). 
Hip-to-ankle work ratio was not different during MS (p = 0.053) compared to PS 
but AUD reduced the ratio by 7 % compared to MS (p = 0.03) and by 19 % compared 
to PS (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that biofeedback of foot plantarflexion 
velocity may be an effective strategy to acutely increase ankle positive work 
and reduce hip-to-ankle work ratio during treadmill walking in old adults.

Falls in older adults often occur during everyday walking activities, especially 
those with complex mediolateral demands. How muscle coordination is modulated to 
achieve these complex mediolateral demands and how age-related changes in 
modulation may compromise this ability are unknown. This study investigates 
age-related changes in the complexity of muscle coordination during a 
goal-directed lateral stepping task using electromyography and motor module 
analysis. Twenty-nine older adults (OA) and twenty-six younger adults (YA) 
performed habitual treadmill walking and a goal-directed lateral stepping task 
designed to mirror real-world tasks with increased lateral movement demands. 
Muscle coordination complexity was quantified using the variability accounted 
for by one motor module, with higher values indicating reduced complexity. Both 
YA and OA exhibited reduced muscle coordination complexity in the stance leg 
during precision stepping compared to habitual treadmill walking. This reduction 
was larger for OA and associated with worse walking balance. In contrast, muscle 
coordination complexity was not different across conditions in the stepping leg 
for either age group. The results of this study provide insights into 
age-related differences in how muscle coordination complexity is modulated to 
meet goal-directed lateral stepping demands during walking that may help explain 
increased susceptibility to falls in older adults.

The benefits of physical exercise are well-known, but there is limited research 
on its effects on the physical and mental health of elderly individuals with 
gait disorders. This review aims to evaluate the impact of physical exercise on 
these outcomes. A literature search was conducted, retrieving studies published 
from inception to November 2024 in databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of 
Science, ProQuest, and SPORTDiscus. Fifteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
were included in the review. The results indicate that physical exercise 
improves both physical health (gait, balance, mobility, reduce fall rate) and 
mental health (Qality of life [QoL] cognitive function, anxiety levels, and 
Activities-Specific Balance Confidence [ABC]) in older adults with gait 
disorders. Of the 15 studies, 10 reported positive effects on both physical and 
mental outcomes, while the remaining five studies showed either no effect or a 
lack of positive results. The interventions evaluated included Tai Chi (TC), 
Tango, aerobic training (AT), resistance training (RT), combined training (CT), 
virtual reality (VR), resistance training plus standard pharmacological 
treatment (RTG + pharmacological treatment), high-speed treadmill training, 
brisk walking, and multimodal exercise program (MEP). Notably, there are six 
items of TC intervention. Most interventions lasted for 12 weeks with sessions 
conducted twice a week, each lasting between 30 and 60 minutes. Additionally, 
limited studies (one per indicator) assessed strength, functional gait 
assessment (FGA), and center of pressure (COP), indicating a need for more 
research in these areas. This review concludes that physical exercise is 
effective in improving physical and mental health outcomes in older adults with 
gait disorders, with TC emerging as the most commonly used and beneficial 
intervention.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Maintaining activities of daily living (ADL) in older 
adults requires muscle strength and physical activity. However, exercise 
motivation often declines with age. Enjoyable activities can enhance motivation 
and effectiveness. Boccia is a recreational sport with rehabilitation potential 
but requires substantial space. This study evaluated the enjoyment and lower 
limb muscle activity of ""Boccia XR,"" a virtual adaptation designed for limited 
spaces, comparing it with traditional Boccia and treadmill walking.
METHODS: Eighteen healthy older adults (mean age 73.3 ±  5.4 years) 
participated. Each performed Boccia XR, traditional Boccia, and treadmill 
walking in random order. Mood changes were assessed using the Profile of Mood 
States 2nd Edition (POMS2), and lower-limb muscle activity was measured via 
electromyography (EMG).
RESULTS: Both Boccia XR and traditional Boccia significantly improved positive 
mood (Vigor-Activity) and reduced negative mood (Total Mood Disturbance) as 
compared to treadmill walking. Muscle activity analysis revealed that Boccia XR 
and traditional Boccia imposed muscle loads comparable to treadmill walking. 
Rectus femoris activity exceeded that of treadmill walking, and medial 
gastrocnemius activation was sufficient for strengthening in sedentary older 
adults during Boccia tasks.
CONCLUSION: Boccia XR is an enjoyable and effective physical activity for older 
adults, requiring less space, than traditional Boccia while providing physical 
benefits similar to treadmill walking. It may enhance exercise adherence and 
overall function in space-limited settings.

Lumbar hyperlordosis and foot overpronation are associated with low back pain 
with extension pattern. This study examined if standing and walking on inclined 
surface or gluteus maximus activation alleviates the extent of lumbar lordosis 
and foot pronation amongst individuals with LBP who were classified with 
extension pattern. Eighteen adults with foot overpronation (LBP group, n = 9 and 
non-LBP group, n = 9) participated in this cross-sectional and case-control 
comparison study. Lumbar lordotic angle and rearfoot angle were measured using 
surface tomography, during standing and walking on treadmill at inclinations of 
0°, 6° and 9°, and voluntary gluteus maximus activation at 20%, 40% and 60% of 
maximal contraction in standing at 0° inclination. The lumbar lordosis angle and 
rearfoot angle were compared within-group and between two groups across the 
listed trials in standing and walking. Results indicated no significant change 
in lumbar lordosis or rearfoot angle in LBP group when standing or walking on 
6°or 9°inclined surface (p > 0.05). However, voluntary gluteus maximus 
activation in standing at the level of 20%, 40% and 60% of maximal effort 
reduced lumbar lordotic angle (p < 0.05) but not rearfoot angle (p > 0.05) in 
LBP group. Our findings provide a novel approach to address the hyperlordosis in 
LBP group with extension pattern, for which voluntary gluteus maximus activation 
of ≥ 20% of maximal effort could effectively reduce the extent of the lumbar 
lordosis in level-ground standing in the LBP group. Such modified lumbar posture 
may alleviate the compressive loading on the spine associated with static 
upright standing at our daily activities. Increased gluteus maximus activation 
found during inclined walking may be beneficial to those with LBP and extension 
pattern.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease is a highly morbid type of atherosclerotic 
vascular disease involving the legs and is estimated to affect over 230 million 
individuals globally. Few therapies improve functional capacity and 
health-related quality of life in people with lower limb peripheral artery 
disease. We aimed to evaluate whether semaglutide improves function as measured 
by walking ability as well as symptoms, quality of life, and outcomes in people 
with peripheral artery disease and type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: STRIDE was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done at 
112 outpatient clinical trial sites in 20 countries in North America, Asia, and 
Europe. Participants were aged 18 years and older, with type 2 diabetes and 
peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication (Fontaine stage IIa, 
able to walk >200 m) and an ankle-brachial index of less than or equal to 0·90 
or toe-brachial index of less than or equal to 0·70. Participants were randomly 
assigned (1:1) using an interactive web response system to receive subcutaneous 
semaglutide 1·0 mg once per week for 52 weeks or placebo. The primary endpoint 
was the ratio to baseline of the maximum walking distance at week 52 measured on 
a constant load treadmill in the full analysis set. Safety was evaluated in the 
safety analysis set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT04560998 and is now completed.
FINDINGS: From Oct 1, 2020, to July 12, 2024, 1363 patients were screened for 
eligibility, of whom 792 were randomly assigned to semaglutide (n=396) or 
placebo (n=396). 195 (25%) participants were female and 597 (75%) were male. 
Median age was 68·0 years (IQR 61·0-73·0). The estimated median ratio to 
baseline in maximum walking distance at week 52 was significantly greater in the 
semaglutide group than the placebo group (1·21 [IQR 0·95-1·55] vs 1·08 
[0·86-1·36]; estimated treatment ratio 1·13 [95% CI 1·06-1·21]; p=0·0004). Six 
serious adverse events in five (1%) participants in the semaglutide group and 
nine serious adverse events in six (2%) participants in the placebo group were 
possibly or probably treatment related, with the most frequent being serious 
gastrointestinal events (two events reports by two [1%] in the semaglutide group 
and five events reported by three [1%] in the placebo group). There were no 
treatment-related deaths.
INTERPRETATION: Semaglutide increased walking distance in patients with 
symptomatic peripheral artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Research implications 
include the need for future studies to further elucidate mechanisms of benefit 
and to assess the efficacy and safety in patients with peripheral artery disease 
who do not have type 2 diabetes.

INTRODUCTION: Metabolic assessment of prosthetic gait is useful when comparing 
devices, interventions, or populations. However, the standard requirement to 
walk continuously for six minutes or more to reach steady state (SS) is 
difficult for many individuals with lower limb amputation. Our goal was to 
assess the concurrent validity of metabolic outcomes from shorter duration 
walking tests with those from the standard six-minute walk, in persons with 
transfemoral or transtibial amputation.
METHODS: Thirty participants (amputation: 10 transfemoral, 10 transtibial, 10 
none) performed three walking tests while data were collected with a wearable 
metabolic system: 1) two-minute treadmill walk plus 10-minute recovery, 2) 
six-minute treadmill walk, and 3) overground two-minute walk test (2MWT). Three 
different analyses were performed to correlate SS metabolic outcomes from 
minutes 5-6 of the six-minute treadmill walk with: 1) total oxygen uptake from 
the two-minute treadmill walk, incorporating excess post-exercise oxygen 
consumption (EPOC), 2) minute interval outcomes from minutes 1-4 of the 
six-minute treadmill walk, and 3) outcomes during minutes 1 and 2 of the 2MWT.
RESULTS: Strong correlations were found between total oxygen uptake of the 
two-minute treadmill walk plus EPOC and SS oxygen uptake (Pearson r 0.86 to 
0.94). Likewise, there were strong correlations between minute interval outcomes 
of minutes 2, 3, and 4 of the six-minute treadmill walk and SS outcomes (Pearson 
r 0.82 to > 0.99). Fewer significant correlations were observed when comparing 
2MWT outcomes with SS outcomes (Pearson r 0.41 to 0.78).
CONCLUSION: Strong correlations between metabolic outcomes of shorter duration 
walking tests with SS outcomes suggest that treadmill walking tests as short as 
two minutes may be acceptable to compare energy expenditure between conditions 
in individuals with lower limb amputation for circumstances where longer 
duration tests would not be possible. Additionally, these shorter tests would be 
more similar to real-life activities and more accessible for those with lower 
limb amputation.

Articular cartilage health depends on optimal joint loading. Both insufficient 
and excessive loading may lead to catabolic effects in cartilage, which 
contribute to the development of osteoarthritis. This study investigates the 
effects of real-time biofeedback from soleus muscle activity on tibiofemoral 
joint loading during walking. Specifically, we examine whether increased soleus 
activation can reduce compressive forces on the medial tibiofemoral compartment 
and lower the external knee adduction moment (KAM), which may help manage 
osteoarthritis. Thirteen healthy young adults completed a baseline walking trial 
on an instrumented treadmill, followed by biofeedback trials, where they were 
instructed to modify soleus activation by +20 %, +40 %, and -20 % using 
real-time electromyography (EMG) feedback. Marker trajectories, ground reaction 
forces, and EMG from the soleus muscle were measured during each trial. KAM was 
estimated with inverse dynamics, and tibiofemoral joint contact forces (JCF) 
were computed with static optimization informed by soleus EMG in OpenSim. A 
linear mixed-effect model was used to analyze the relationship between soleus 
activation and tibiofemoral JCFs. Participants significantly increased soleus 
muscle activation in +20 % (Δ% = 20.27 ± 17.87, p = 0.043) and +40 % (Δ% = 
25.17 ± 26.64, p = 0.037) biofeedback trials but could not decrease it. A 
negative correlation was found between soleus activation and total (slope: 
-0.172, p < 0.001), medial (slope: -0.077, p = 0.007), and lateral (slope: 
-0.266, p < 0.001) JCFs, with interindividual differences observed. While 
increasing soleus activation reduced JCFs, it also significantly increased KAM 
(slope: 0.358, p < 0.001). These findings show that soleus EMG biofeedback can 
be used to modify knee joint loading, but personalized approaches are needed.

Ants are known for their sophisticated navigational abilities and rely on 
various cues to locate food sources efficiently. Visual landmarks play a crucial 
role in guiding foraging behavior. However, the significance of walking ants 
perceiving the relative motion of a landmark to themselves during learning is 
still not fully understood. Here, Japanese carpenter ants were observed on a 
treadmill device where they could walk in place on the treadmill. Two types of 
conditions were set for the training process: the fixed condition involved a 
stationary landmark, and the moving condition featured a landmark oscillating at 
a constant speed from side to side after feeding, which was independent of the 
movements of the ants. In the Y-maze test, a significantly greater number of 
ants in the moving training condition associated the landmark with food (82% of 
the ants) than in the fixed training condition (56% of the ants). Our results 
thus suggest that perceiving the relative movement of landmarks during the 
learning process on a treadmill is important for ant foragers.

Current routine diagnostic procedures for back pain mainly focus on static 
spinal analyses. Dynamic Surface Topography (DST) is an easy-to-use, 
radiation-free addition, allowing spine analyses under dynamic conditions. Until 
now, it is unclear if this method is applicable to back pain patients, and data 
reports are missing. Within a prospective observational study, 32 patients 
suffering from thoracic and lumbar back pain were examined while walking, 
randomized at four speeds (2, 3, 4, 5 km/h), using a DST measuring device (DIERS 
4Dmotion® Lab). The measurement results were compared with those of a healthy 
reference group. We calculated the intrasegmental rotation for every subject and 
summed up the spinal motion in a standardized gait cycle. The Mann-Whitney U 
Test was used to compare the painful and healthy reference groups at the four 
different speeds. In a subgroup analysis, the painful group was divided into two 
groups: one with less pain (≤3 points on the Visual Analogue Scale) and one with 
more pain (>3 points on the Visual Analogue Scale). The Kruskal-Wallis Test was 
used to compare these subgroups with the healthy reference group. Of the 32 
included patients, not all could walk at the intended speeds (5 km/h: 28/32). At 
speeds of 2-4 km/h, our results point to greater total segmental rotation of 
back pain patients compared to the healthy reference group. At a speed of 3 
km/h, we observed more movement in the patients with more pain. Overall, we 
monitored small differences on average between the groups but large standard 
deviations. We conclude that the DST measuring approach is eligible for back 
pain patients when they feel confident enough to walk on a treadmill. Initial 
results suggest that DST can be used to obtain interesting therapeutic 
information for an individual patient.

BackgroundStudying the dynamics of nonlinear systems under dual-task conditions 
in people with functional ankle instability (FAI) can provide additional 
information about the variability of the structure of the system. However, how 
the cognitive load affects the stride-to-stride variability in the lower 
extremities throughout walking in those with and without FAI using nonlinear 
evaluation tools is unknown.MethodsEighteen volunteers with FAI and 19 healthy 
individuals were recruited for this study. The participants walked on a 
motor-driven treadmill at their preferred speed, with or without completing a 
cognitive task involving an auditory Stroop test. A passive retroreflective 
marker motion-capture system recorded the lower extremity gait kinematics in the 
sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes. The largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) 
characterizes the variability of the temporal structure in walking patterns. 
Cognitive task performance was analyzed using error ratio and average reaction 
time in walking and sitting conditions.ResultsDuring walking with cognitive 
load, the group with FAI exhibited lower values for the LyE in knee kinematics 
in the sagittal plane than the normal walking (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.44-0.92, P < .001). During normal walking (single task), participants with FAI 
demonstrated higher knee flexion-extension LyE (95% CI: 0.52-0.93, P = .04) than 
healthy people. The 2 groups had no significant differences regarding the LyE 
values for other kinematic variables (P > .05). Regarding cognitive performance, 
both FAI and healthy groups had remarkably longer reaction times (P < .001) 
while walking (mean ± SD: 0.92 ± 0.06) compared with the sitting condition (mean 
± SD: 0.77 ± 0.03).ConclusionThe reduced variability observed in the walking 
patterns of individuals with FAI during walking with an added cognitive load 
suggests a compensatory mechanism due to sensorimotor constraints, highlighting 
the altered motor control strategies. Dual task and cognitive training may help 
correct these patterns and improve responses.Levels of Evidence:Level II.

An active insole to reduce plantar pressure loading: using predictive finite 
element driven soft hydraulic actuators to minimise plantar pressure and the 
pressure time integral for diabetic foot ulceration risk management.

OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole 
to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot 
ulceration for people living with diabetes.
METHODS: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It 
was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants' foot 
with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time 
integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 
people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal 
plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes.
RESULTS: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average 
peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] 
and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst 
minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. 
The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested 
between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic 
participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite 
element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with 
diabetes.
SIGNIFICANCE: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole 
technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to 
outwork this in real world activity.

Graded exertion testing has diagnostic utility in the management of athletes 
with sport-related and recreation-related concussions, the results of which are 
used to prescribe individualized aerobic exercise treatment that facilitates 
recovery from sport-related concussion and reduces the incidence of symptoms 
persisting beyond 1 month. Current exertion protocols, such as the Buffalo 
Concussion Treadmill Test, however, are recommended for patients aged 13 years 
and older and are not appropriate for younger children with concussion. This 
practical management article describes a pediatric exertion test protocol using 
a standard, commercially available treadmill that is designed for patients aged 
5 to 12 years with concussion. The Pediatric Concussion Treadmill Test (PCTT) 
uses age-appropriate walking speeds and symptom-reporting scales and provides 
additional guidelines on how to perform the test safely in younger children. The 
PCTT is intended to identify the presence and severity of concussion-related 
exercise intolerance and can function as an important component of a 
comprehensive medical evaluation of concussion in children.

Several studies have observed a relationship between step length variability and 
the metabolic cost of walking. In those studies, changes in step length 
variability were secondary to changes in walking speed or step width 
variability. The purpose of this study was to determine how directly increasing 
step length variability affects the metabolic cost of walking. Eighteen healthy 
young adults completed 5 min trials of treadmill walking at 1.20 m s-1 while we 
manipulated their step length variability. Illuminated rectangles were projected 
onto the surface of a treadmill to cue step length variabilities of 0%, 5% and 
10% coefficient of variation. Step length and its variability were tracked with 
reflective markers on the feet. Metabolic power across habitual (no projections) 
and the three variability conditions was measured using indirect calorimetry and 
analyzed using linear mixed effects modeling. Metabolic power was largest in the 
10% condition (mean±s.d. 4.30±0.23 W kg-1) compared with 0% (4.16±0.18 W kg-1) 
and habitual (3.98±0.25 W kg-1). Actual step length variability was 
significantly different from prescribed conditions: 0%, 3.17±0.64%; 5%, 
4.38±0.98% and 10%, 6.94±1.07%. For every 1% increase in step length 
variability, there was a 1.1% (0.05 W kg-1; P<0.001) increase in metabolic 
power. Our results demonstrate an association between the metabolic cost of 
walking and step length variability. This suggests that increased gait 
variability contributes to a small portion of the increased cost of walking seen 
in older adults and people with neurological impairments.

BackgroundPeople with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) have difficulty adapting their 
gait to asymmetrical conditions. Objective. We investigated cortical activity 
between 42 PwPD (HY 2-3) and 42 healthy controls using functional near-infrared 
spectroscopy during tied-belt (TB) and split-belt (SB) treadmill 
walking.MethodsOxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) was measured in the prefrontal 
cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), premotor cortex (PMC), and posterior 
parietal cortex (PPC) during 3 blocks of treadmill walking: (1) with the belts 
moving at the same speed (TB) and (2) when the speed of 1 side was reduced by 
50% (SB; 2 blocks). The ability to adjust gait to asymmetric conditions was 
quantified by step length asymmetry and its variability.ResultsAdaptive gait was 
worse during the last 5 steps of SB versus TB in PwPD compared to controls. PwPD 
showed higher HbO2 in the PMC (P = .005) and PPC (P = .004) relative to 
controls, regardless of condition. However, an increase in HbO2 in the SMA 
during SB was shown relative to TB in PwPD, a change not observed in controls 
(group × condition interaction P = .048; pairwise post hoc P = .032). 
Interestingly, increased PPC activity in PwPD was associated with poorer adapted 
gait.ConclusionsBoth regular and adaptive gait required enhanced cortical 
processing in PwPD, as evidenced by the increased activation in the PMC and PPC. 
However, this heightened cortical activity did not correlate with a reduction in 
gait asymmetry, suggesting that these changes might be maladaptive. Instead, the 
elevated cortical activity may reflect the challenges PwPD face in adapting to 
asymmetrical walking conditions. Careful interpretation is warranted given the 
relatively small sample of mildly affected PwPD, limiting generalizability to 
the broader population and the measurement errors inherent to functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy .

INTRODUCTION: Several studies have explored alternatives to enhance the 
performance, health, and safety of sports horses. One promising method involves 
the use of vibrating platforms (VP), which offer passive exercise stimulation 
via mechanical oscillations distributed throughout the body. This type of 
exercise is referred to as whole-body vibration (WBV) and is an emerging 
strategy for accelerating muscle recovery. This study examined the dynamics of 
proteins responsible for transporting monocarboxylates (MCT1 and MCT4), and 
their relationship with lactatemia and acid-base balance in connection with WBV 
recovery following intense treadmill exercise in horses.
METHODS: Eight crossbred horses underwent the standardized exercise test on the 
treadmill to determine the velocity corresponding to the lactate threshold. This 
velocity was used to prescribe the external load of the acute intense exercise 
bout (AIEB), which was performed to recruit rapidly fatigable type II muscle 
fibers and induce hyperlactatemia and metabolic acidosis. The horses were 
assigned to three experimental groups in a crossover design, with a 7-day 
washout period. The treadmill group (TG) actively recovered through 
low-intensity treadmill walking. The WBV group (WBVG) followed a stepwise 
recovery protocol on VP, with each step lasting 2 min and the frequencies 
decreasing in a specific order: 76, 66, 55, 46, and 32 Hz. The sham group (SG) 
was designated for horses with the VP turned off. All groups experienced a 
uniform recovery strategy duration of 10 min. Heart rate (HR), rectal 
temperature (RT), lactatemia, glycemia, acid-base status and electrolytes, 
strong ion difference (SID), and muscle monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1 and 
MCT4), were assessed.
RESULTS: AIEB induced positive chronotropic effects, hyperlactatemia and 
moderate metabolic acidosis in all experimental groups. All groups also showed 
transitory hyperthermia, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, 
hyperkalemia and SID reduction. HR was higher in TG than in the WBVG and SG 
immediately after the recovery procedures. Between the groups, there was no 
change in RT, lactatemia, glycemia and MCT1 and MCT4 content. Regardless of 
groups, the MCT4 content decreased 3 and 6 h after recovery strategies.
DISCUSSION: It was concluded that a single whole-body vibration session did not 
enhance recovery of lactatemia or acid-base balance in horses after intense 
treadmill exercise.

Pinkston et al. (2024) provided 17 participants with their high-preference music 
for increasing and decreasing their walking speeds on a treadmill. The results 
showed that high-preference music produced schedule control of walking speed for 
14 of 17 (82.35%) participants. In addition, Pinkston et al. found that 78.57% 
of participants whose walking showed schedule control also displayed variable 
responding during an extinction component. As an extension of Pinkston et al., 
we presented 25 participants with their high-preference music for walking on a 
treadmill during a five-component mixed schedule wherein the synchronous 
reinforcement components contained larger and nonoverlapping bands for 
contacting the synchronous reinforcer. Schedule control emerged for 18 of 25 
(72%) participants. In addition, 14 (77.78%) participants whose behavior showed 
schedule control also displayed considerable variability in walking speed during 
the extinction component. Implications and future research directions for 
promoting health-related behaviors are discussed.

In a simple model of bipedal walking, both a muscle moment at the hip and an 
impulsive push generated through ankle plantarflexion power gait. There is a 
biomechanical tradeoff between ankle and hip moments in the sagittal plane. 
Although ankle pushoff is primarily sagittal, its impact on frontal-plane 
mechanics, which are related to hip and knee injury risk, remains underexplored. 
This study aimed to investigate how increased ankle pushoff influences 
frontal-plane hip and knee moments during level walking. Understanding these 
effects could guide treatments for individuals with hip or knee symptoms linked 
to frontal-plane mechanics. Thirty-seven healthy adults walked on an 
instrumented treadmill under two conditions: Habitual (typical gait) and Push 
(increased ankle pushoff). Kinematic and kinetic data were collected and 
normalized for gait cycle and body weight. Statistical parametric mapping and 
peak value analysis were used to compare differences in internal joint moments 
and angles between conditions. Increased pushoff was confirmed by greater ankle 
plantarflexion moments and angular impulse in the Push condition. At the hip, 
increased pushoff resulted in a greater abduction moment early in stance and a 
reduced abduction moment and adduction angle late in stance. At the knee, 
increased pushoff led to a greater abduction moment late in stance. These 
findings suggest that increasing ankle pushoff during walking has significant 
effects on hip and knee frontal-plane biomechanics, which may not be beneficial 
for individuals with conditions influenced by hip and knee abduction moments.

Falls, River Falls, Wisconsin, United States.

Many exercise and sport science (EXSS) undergraduate students enter their 
programs with weight bias, which can hinder their ability to empathize and 
effectively work with overweight individuals. This experiential learning 
activity explored the physiological and emotional responses to exercise with 
additional mass. Furthermore, this experience sought to address weight bias 
among EXSS students by promoting a deeper understanding of the difficulties 
faced by individuals with excess body weight during exercise. Twelve students 
enrolled in an Exercise for Special Populations course participated in treadmill 
walking and cycling exercise with and without 15% additional body mass. During 
exercise, the effects of additional mass on cardiometabolic [e.g., heart rate, 
blood pressure, oxygen uptake (V̇o2), caloric expenditure] and psychological 
(e.g., perceived exertion, affective response) measures were evaluated. Before 
the experiential activity, students engaged in a lecture reviewing 
preparticipation screening, body composition assessment, and exercise testing 
procedures. Students reported significant differences in physiological and 
affective responses to exercise between the two modalities, with treadmill 
walking with additional mass showing increased exertion. Interestingly, student 
predictions of psychological responses to walking with additional mass were less 
negative than their actual experiences, highlighting the difficulty of 
exercising with additional body mass. Postactivity feedback indicated that 
students felt highly confident in administering exercise tests and reported 
enhanced awareness of the challenges faced by overweight individuals. These 
observations support that incorporating practical activities involving altered 
body weight can improve practical skills and foster greater empathy toward 
overweight populations, enhancing student preparedness for careers in allied 
health fields.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This experience included a didactic lecture and 
student-led experiential activity where exercise and sport science students 
simulated overweight conditions during treadmill and cycling exercises to 
measure the cardiometabolic and psychological difficulties faced by this 
population during physical activity. The activity not only improved students' 
ability to conduct exercise tests and other clinical skills but also promoted 
empathy, reduced weight bias, and helped prepare students to work effectively 
with overweight individuals in their future professional roles.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of digital treadmill on lower limb motor 
function in patients with ischemic stroke.
METHOD: This was a clinical comparative study. A total of 60 patients with 
ischemic stroke at Hebei University Hospital were selected from October 2020 to 
September 2022 and randomly divided observation group and control group. The 
control group was given conventional rehabilitation therapy, with the 
observation group receiving digital treadmill training. Both groups were 
assessed using the Holden Functional Ambulation Category Scale(FAC), digital 
treadmill gait analysis system, and dynamic balance instrument and after four 
weeks, followed by a statistical analysis.
RESULT: After four weeks of treatment, both groups showed an improved in FAC 
grading, gait spatiotemporal parameters (including step speed, step length, 
stance time and step height), gait kinematic parameters (including hip joint 
flexion and extension mobility, knee joint flexion and extension mobility, and 
active ankle dorsiflexion ability) and balance assessment parameters (including 
motion trajectory area and motion trajectory perimeter) compared to 
pre-treatment (p< 0.05). Additionally, the gait symmetry parameters, including 
step length deviation and step height deviation, in the observation group were 
significantly lower than pre-treatment (p< 0.05), while in the control group, 
without statistically significant differences(p>0.05). Furthermore, the 
inter-group comparisons showed significant improvements of all the parameters 
studied above in the observation group compared to the control group (p< 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Digital treadmill training may effectively improve gait parameters, 
gait symmetry, walking and balance ability of patients with ischemic stroke.

INTRODUCTION: Many people fail to meet physical activity guidelines. One 
possible solution is wearable technology. Yet it is unclear if popular devices 
such as the Apple Watch can accurately measure intensity, which is a cornerstone 
of physical activity guidelines. We developed a bespoke Apple Watch app based on 
the use of relative intensity (%HRR), with the aim to determine if the bespoke 
app measures 'moderate' intensity more accurately compared to the native Apple 
Watch Activity app, using % oxygen consumption reserve (%VO2R) as the criterion.
METHODS: Seventy-four participants (18-65 years) attended the laboratory twice. 
During Visit 1, they completed medical screening, and measurements of resting 
heart rate, maximal oxygen consumption, and maximal heart rate on a motorised 
treadmill. During Visit 2, participants completed 5-minute treadmill bouts 
starting at 3.5 km.h-1, increasing by 0.5 km.h-1 until the bespoke app recorded 
3 minutes at ≥40%HRR, and the native app recorded 5 minutes of 'exercise'. 
Oxygen consumption and heart rate were recorded. Bayesian posterior 
distributions were used to compare the two apps.
RESULTS: At the walking speed that the native app recorded exercise, the mean 
(95% HDI) %VO2R was 33 (31-36)%, which is below moderate relative intensity 
(40%HRR). This is compared to a mean (95% HDI) of 43 (40-44)% for our bespoke 
app.
CONCLUSION: The bespoke app measured relative moderate intensity more accurately 
compared to the native app when compared to the %VO2R criterion. Exercise 
guidelines and wearable devices should incorporate relative measures of physical 
activity to better individualise monitoring and prescription.

Due to inadequate commercial availability of sports bras designed with adequate 
breast support for full-busted women (cup size D and above), breast discomfort 
can be a significant barrier to exercise. In this study, postural 
characteristics during dynamic physical activities were evaluated for 20 
full-busted women in 3 different sports bra conditions, 2 of which were bras 
designed specifically for full-busted women. Participants performed quiet 
standing, walking, jumping jacks, high knees, and running tasks on a force plate 
treadmill in each condition to collect postural measures associated with center 
of pressure (COP). COP measures were also evaluated with respect to body 
composition, metabolic health markers, and sex hormone profiles. COP measures 
were larger in high knees and jumping tasks with respect to quiet standing. 
Across running speeds, conventional bras were associated with the largest COP 
metrics. Analysis of covariance analysis indicated increased anthropometry 
measures such as mass and body fat percentage resulted in decreased COP area and 
favored mediolateral orientation. Luteinizing hormone, estradiol, progesterone, 
testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin were all found to impact 
statistical models, indicating the importance of incorporating a comprehensive 
hormone panel when considering the impact subject-level variations have on motor 
function.

Differences in lower limb co-contraction calculations vary clinical 
interpretation of aquatic treadmill walking in typically developing and children 
with cerebral palsy.

Medical Center, Omaha, NE, United States.

OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to (1) investigate muscle 
co-contraction during aquatic (Wet) and conventional (Dry) treadmill walking at 
various speeds in typically developing (TD) and children with cerebral palsy 
(CP) and (2) explore how the clinical interpretation of co-contraction, using 
co-contraction indices (CCI), may vary depending on the method employed.
METHODS: Fifteen TD children (30 limbs, 7 M | 8F, 11.3 ± 4.1 yrs., 
1.46 ± 0.18 m, 44.2 ± 16.8 kg) and 10 children with CP (20 limbs, 6 M | 4F, 
13.1 ± 3.5 yrs., 1.54 ± 0.18 m, 53.2 ± 26.2 kg, 7 GMFCS I and 3 II) participated 
in this study. Muscle activity of the tibialis anterior (TA), rectus femoris 
(RF), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and semitendinosus (ST) was recorded during 
three 3-min walking trials on a Dry treadmill followed by a Wet treadmill. 
Muscle co-contraction was calculated using three common CCI calculation methods 
for the RF/ST and TA/MG muscle pairings. Separate linear mixed-effects models 
examined the influence of population (TD vs. CP), walking speed (Slow, Normal, 
Fast), and treadmill environment (Dry vs. Wet) on CCI for each equation and 
muscle pairing.
RESULTS: CCIUnnithan and CCIRudolph demonstrated that aquatic treadmill walking 
reduced muscle co-contraction in TD (p < 0.001) and CP (p < 0.012) populations 
for the RF/ST muscle pairing. Additionally, CCIUnnithan and CCIRudolph showed 
significant differences between speeds in both environments (p < 0.001) except 
for the Slow-Normal comparison in the aquatic treadmill (p > 0.423). All methods 
had a significant CCI reduction in the TA/MG muscle pairing for both 
populations. For the RF/ST muscle pairing, CCIF&W showed that only TD children 
had lower muscle co-contraction in the aquatic treadmill (p = 0.023). CCIF&W 
also showed no speed effect for the muscle pairings.
CONCLUSION: This study shows the potential of aquatic treadmill walking to 
reduce muscle co-contraction; however, caution is recommended as clinical 
implications can vary due to the computation method. Future studies should aim 
to report values from multiple methods to account for the variability within 
methods and validation of results.

Detecting motor fatigue during rigorous activities is essential for preventing 
injuries, falls, and over-exertion. While research has focused on developing 
fatigue indices using motion capture or wearable sensors, the method of inducing 
fatigue can impact movement patterns differently. This study compared the 
effects of whole-body motor fatigue induced by incline treadmill walking with 
localized fatigue induced by leg presses and isolated ankle movements, as 
investigated in our prior study. Twenty healthy young participants walked at 
1.25 m/s for 5 min before (PRE) and after (POST) motor fatigue. We computed 
POST-to-PRE ratios for walking stability and variability measures, including 
dynamic margins of stability (MOS), step spatiotemporal measures, kinematic 
variability, and local dynamic stability based on short-term local divergence 
exponents (LDEs) of trunk movement. Localized fatigue increased mean step width 
(p = 0.002), mean mediolateral MOS (p = 0.015), knee joint angle variability (p 
< 0.001), and the mean peak mediolateral center of mass velocity (p < 0.001) 
more than whole-body fatigue. Whole-body fatigue reduced short-term LDE values 
of anterior-posterior trunk motion (p = 0.021), indicating greater improvement 
in local dynamic stability. The findings indicate that localized fatigue has a 
greater impact on gait variability and stability than whole-body fatigue. The 
methods of inducing motor fatigue led to different changes in gait.

Background Half of the chronic alcoholic population usually relapses after 
extensive treatment in de-addiction centers. This craving is due to the reduced 
release of hormones in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, 
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal, and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axes. 
Exercise has a positive influence on some of these neuroendocrine axes, 
releasing corticotrophin, cortisol, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Thus, there is a 
need to study the additional benefits of exercises during de-addiction programs 
on craving and anxiety in acute alcohol-de-addicted individuals. This study aims 
to compare blood levels of oxytocin, cortisol, and vasopressin and relate these 
factors' influence on craving and anxiety in individuals performing short-bout 
aerobics regularly and those not performing any type of exercise in an alcohol 
de-addiction center. Methodology In this quasi-experimental study, 76 
individuals from an alcohol de-addiction center were selected and divided into 
two equal groups using systematic random sampling after obtaining ethical 
clearance from the institutional ethical committee. The experimental group was 
treated with two sessions of aerobic exercises each day for five days a week. 
One session consisted of five repetitions of cycling, and the other session 
consisted of five repetitions of fast walking on a computerized treadmill. In 
both sessions, two minutes of workout were followed by three minutes of rest. 
The control group was not given any exercise protocol but was treated with 
de-addiction medications and advised regular counseling with a psychiatrist 
similar to the experimental group. The treatment was given for one month. Blood 
levels of oxytocin, cortisol, and vasopressin were collected before and after 
intervention in both groups. Anxiety levels and alcohol cravings were measured 
in both groups using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Penn Alcohol Craving Scale, 
respectively, before starting the treatment and after one month of treatment. 
Based on the normality test status, non-parametric statistical tests were used 
for analyzing data related to oxytocin, cortisol, and vasopressin levels. 
Anxiety and craving levels were analyzed using parametric statistical tests. 
Results An extremely significant difference was noted (p < 0.001) before and 
after treatment in both groups. Individuals in the experimental group treated 
with short-bout exercises significantly improved their blood levels of oxytocin, 
cortisol, and vasopressin when compared to the control group. The same levels of 
improvement were observed for craving and anxiety when compared to the control 
group. Conclusions Short-bout aerobic exercises showed better results in 
treating alcohol craving and anxiety in individuals with alcohol use disorder 
admitted to a de-addiction center. These positive effects may be related to the 
influence of short-bout aerobic exercises on neuroendocrine effects, which 
regulate the blood levels of oxytocin, cortisol, and vasopressin.

Although time since amputation (TSAmp) is recognized as a primary factor 
influencing the walking ability of individuals with unilateral transfemoral 
amputation (uTFA), the specific effects of TSAmp on gait asymmetry remain 
insufficiently investigated. This study aimed to clarify whether gait asymmetry 
decrease with longer TSAmp across a range of walking speeds. Thirty individuals 
with uTFA, classified as K-3 and K-4 functional levels, participated in this 
study. Participants walked at eight speeds (ranging from 2.0 to 5.5 km/h in 
increments of 0.5 km/h) on an instrumented treadmill. Spatiotemporal parameters 
and peak values of ground reaction forces (GRFs), including anteroposterior, 
mediolateral, and vertical components, were measured to calculate the asymmetry 
ratio. Linear regression analyses were subsequently conducted to examine the 
relationships between TSAmp, TSAmp/Age (age-normalized TSAmp), and the asymmetry 
ratio. The results demonstrated no significant correlations between TSAmp, 
TSAmp/Age, and the asymmetry ratio across all measured parameters and walking 
speeds. These findings suggest that TSAmp and TSAmp/Age exhibit weak 
associations with gait asymmetry in terms of spatiotemporal parameters and peak 
GRFs. The results of the present study suggest that neither TSAmp nor TSAmp/Age 
are necessarily associated with gait asymmetry. Therefore, predicting gait 
asymmetry in individuals with uTFA based solely on TSAmp is not feasible.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a common complication of diabetes. This study 
aims to investigate the relationships between in-shoe plantar temperature, 
normal and shear stress during walking and rest periods for participants with 
and without diabetes. For this purpose, a novel temperature, normal and shear 
stress sensing system was developed and embedded in an insole at the hallux, 
first metatarsal head and calcaneus region. Ten participants living with 
diabetes with no history of previous ulceration and ten healthy participants 
were recruited. Participants walked on a treadmill for 15 min and then rested 
for 20 min wearing the sensing insole. Results showed high correlation 
(Spearman's rs ≥ 0.917) between heat energy, total plantar temperature change, 
during walking and strain energy, cumulative stress squared in all participants. 
Importantly, between-group comparisons showed indications of thermal regulation 
differences in participants with and without diabetes, with the first metatarsal 
head site showing significantly higher temperature at the end of the active 
period (P = 0.0097) although walking speed and mechanical stress were similar. 
This research demonstrates for the first time the correlation between strain 
energy and heat energy in-shoe during gait. Further research is needed to 
quantify relationships and investigate thermal regulation as a mechanism for DFU 
formation.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate whether the worsening of meniscus 
function caused by medial meniscus extrusion (MME) was associated with acute 
cartilage deformation in the medial femur after mechanical loading, which 
changes depending on the contact force on the cartilage.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of our previous study investigating acute 
cartilage deformation after mechanical loading in older women. Fifty-six women, 
aged ≥50 years, participated in the previous study, 48 of whom (age: 
70.3 ± 7.6 years) participated in the meniscus assessment and were included in 
this analysis. MME was assessed using ultrasonographic B-mode images acquired in 
the standing position. Acute cartilage deformation was assessed based on the 
reduction in cartilage thickness after 15 min of treadmill walking. The 
mechanical cumulative loading was calculated by multiplying the time integrals 
of the positive values of the knee adduction moment, as assessed by motion 
analysis with the number of steps taken during treadmill walking. Paired t-tests 
were performed to compare cartilage thickness in pre- and post-walking. In 
addition, multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate 
whether MME was associated with acute cartilage deformation after walking.
RESULTS: Significant cartilage deformation occurred after treadmill walking 
(pre-walking: 1.6 ± 0.3 mm, post-walking: 1.5 ± 0.3 mm, P < 0.001, effect size 
(r) = 0.760). MME was associated with the amount of acute cartilage deformation 
after walking, independent of cumulative mechanical loading or cartilage 
condition (unstandardized regression coefficient B = 0.013, 95% confidence 
interval: 0.001-0.025, P = 0.033, effect size (R2) = 0.144).
CONCLUSION: Greater MME is associated with increased acute cartilage deformation 
after mechanical loading.

BACKGROUND: Toe walking in children with cerebral palsy is typically less stable 
and less energy-efficient than plantigrade walking in typically developing 
children. We hypothesized that children with cerebral palsy may, nevertheless, 
show more stable toe walking due to the development of contractures compared to 
age-matched typically developing children.
METHODS: Multiscale entropy of the vertical position of the ankle joint was used 
to measure ankle joint stability during the stance phase of walking. Kinematic 
data were obtained from 37 children with spastic cerebral palsy and habitual toe 
walking, who walked on a treadmill at their preferred speed (1.3 ± 0.5 km/h for 
cerebral palsy children and 1.5 ± 0.4 km/h for typically developing children). 
Recordings from 21 age-matched typically developing children were used for 
comparison. Typically developing children walked both normally (plantigrade) and 
on toes.
FINDINGS: Multiscale entropy was significantly higher during toe walking than 
plantigrade walking in typically developing children (P < 0.001). For children 
under 6 years, multiscale entropy was higher in cerebral palsy children than in 
typically developing children. For children over 6 years, the opposite was 
observed. In children with cerebral palsy, multiscale entropy decreased with 
reduced passive range of motion in the ankle joint (P < 0.001).
INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that contractures in children with 
cerebral palsy stabilize the ankle during toe walking. Younger children may show 
greater stability due to early contracture development, while advanced 
contractures in older children may reduce stability.

We explored the extent to which pre-fatigue gait variability during load 
carriage is associated with the ability of an individual to perform an obstacle 
course post-fatigue. Twenty-four military cadets were monitored during treadmill 
gait and completed an obstacle course before and after a full-body fatigue 
protocol. Gait variability measures were determined from spatiotemporal stride 
characteristics, joint angle trajectories, and inter-joint coordination. These 
measures were then used in multiple linear regression models to predict three 
measures of post-fatigue performance (i.e., hurdle completion time, maximum jump 
height, and maximum jump distance). Measures of joint kinematic variability 
predicted 73-89% of the variance in post-fatigue performance. Specifically, the 
significant predictors were sagittal plane variability of 1) hip angle and 
hip-knee coordination during swing phase; and 2) knee-ankle coordination during 
both stance and swing phase. Measures of joint kinematic variability obtained 
from gait thus appear relevant for predicting individual differences in adapting 
to fatigue, and such measures could aid in predicting post-fatigue performance 
in diverse dynamic tasks.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac diagnostic testing continues to evolve, and controversies 
remain regarding the optimal utilization of different procedures. We sought to 
evaluate changes in long-term utilization trends for a wide range of cardiac 
diagnostic tests in the context of advancing technologies and updated 
guidelines.
METHODS: Annual cardiac testing volumes from 2010 to 2022 in the Medicare Part B 
population were compared across tests and by provider specialty and analyzed 
using Joinpoint regression.
RESULTS: The most-utilized test in the Medicare population remained 
transthoracic echocardiography, accounting for 61.5% of cardiac testing use in 
2011 and 67.7% in 2022, followed by single-photon emission computed tomography 
(CT) myocardial perfusion imaging, which decreased from 20.8% to 12.9%. 
Single-photon emission CT myocardial perfusion imaging use decreased relative to 
positron emission tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (ratio of 39:1 in 2011 
to 7:1 in 2022), stress cardiac magnetic resonance (1179:1 in 2011, 268:1 in 
2022), and coronary CT angiography (61:1 in 2011, 10:1 in 2022). Decreased use 
was also observed for exercise treadmill testing (2.3% to 1.7%), stress 
echocardiography (3.6% to 2.6%), multigated acquisition (0.4% to 0.1%), and 
invasive coronary angiography (8.0% to 7.0%). The use of fractional flow reserve 
by CT per 100 000 Medicare enrollees increased by >16-fold from 2018 (the first 
year covered) to 2022, and cardiac amyloidosis pyrophosphate scintigraphy 
studies increased 4-fold from 2011 to 2022 (0.17% to 0.68%). Positron emission 
tomography myocardial perfusion imaging volumes have surpassed exercise 
treadmill test volumes and, assuming the current rate of change continues, are 
projected to surpass stress echocardiography volumes in 2024. Coronary CT 
angiography is projected to overtake exercise treadmill testing in 2024 and 
stress echocardiography in 2025.
CONCLUSIONS: Between 2010 and 2022, cardiac diagnostic testing in the US 
Medicare population shifted from invasive angiography and traditional stress 
testing toward an increase in cardiac CT, cardiac magnetic resonance, and 
positron emission tomography. Pyrophosphate scintigraphy studies also increased, 
as did fractional flow reserve by CT since its introduction. Changes in 
preferred diagnostic modalities suggest a need to reevaluate current 
recommendations for training in cardiovascular medicine.

Controlled ankle motion (CAM) boots are commonly recommended to protect the 
foot-ankle complex in reducing loading, continuing ambulation, and maintaining 
daily activities. However, maintaining a normal and comfortable gait while 
wearing CAM boots is quite challenging. The added weight of the CAM boot, 
coupled with reduced ankle work capacity, hinders the full execution of gait 
parameters, leading to spatiotemporal asymmetry. Different loads on the sole 
also increase the total mechanical work in the foot. The primary aim of this 
study was to investigate the impact of short CAM boots on spatiotemporal gait 
parameters and plantar pressure distribution. Twenty-four healthy participants 
were recruited for the study. The participants were asked to walk barefoot and 
wear bilateral short CAM boots at their comfortable speed. Spatiotemporal gait 
parameters, foot-pressure distribution, and force were evaluated with Zebris 
FDM-THM-S treadmill system (Zebris Medical GmbH, Germany) under both conditions, 
the right and left extremities were evaluated independently. One-way Analysis of 
Variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the spatiotemporal characteristics of the 
participants. Significant differences were observed between barefoot and CAM 
boot walking for all parameters(p < 0.05), except walking speed (p > 0.05). 
Short CAM boots walking showed a notable increase in the forefoot, midfoot, and 
hindfoot pressure distribution, with the highest rise in the midfoot region 
(p < 0.05). Short CAM boots cause an increase in pressure of the entire sole, 
therefore, caution should be taken before recommending this device, particularly 
in midfoot pathologies.

Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, China.

BACKGROUND: Evaluating the effectiveness of Nordic walking in influencing 
walking ability in patients with peripheral arterial disease.
METHODS: We searched 12 databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, 
Web of Science, EBSCO host, Ovid, Scopus, ClinicalTrial.gov, and several top 
ranked Chinese databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure 
(CNKI), Wanfang Data, CBMdisc, VIP Database, ChiCTR. The search has no starting 
time limit and the deadline is April 9, 2024. Randomized controlled trials and 
pseudo-random controlled trials were included. The two authors independently 
screened the literature and evaluated the quality of the study using the 
Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4 
and Stata 17.0 software.
RESULTS: A total of 8 studies involving 508 patients were included. 
Meta-analysis results showed that compared with supervised exercise therapy 
(SET), supervised NW was not associated with an increase in maximum walking 
distance (MWD) and claudication distance (CD) in PAD patients, whether during 
treadmill tests or 6-minute walk tests (6-MWT), and the results were not 
statistically significant. In terms of increasing exercise duration, SET was 
significantly higher than supervised NW and the results were statistically 
significant (SMD =  -0.41, 95% Cl: -0.72 to -0.09, Z =  2.54, P =  0.01 <  
0.05). Among the 8 studies included, 2 studies had control groups that were not 
part of the supervised exercise program and were different, therefore no 
meta-analysis was conducted.
CONCLUSIONS: In PAD patients, supervised NW is no significant difference in 
walking ability compared to SET. NW presents a viable option when SET is not 
available.

OBJECTIVE: Inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a method for assessing gait 
beyond the confines of a laboratory. Signal noise and calibration errors pose 
significant obstacles to accurately estimating joint angles, particularly during 
dynamic activities such as running. Advancements in dynamic optimisation tools 
could enable a more comprehensive analysis with fewer sensors and/or low-quality 
data. The objective of this study was to compare two IMU-based modelling 
approaches (inverse kinematics and optimal control simulations) with optical 
marker-based motion capture in reconstructing running gait kinematics.
METHODS: Six participants performed treadmill running at three speeds whilst 
marker trajectories and IMU signals were collected concurrently. The 
subject-specific biomechanical model consisted of a 3D representation of the 
lower body and torso, with contact spheres added to simulate ground contact in 
the optimal control simulations. The objective of the optimal control 
simulations was to track the accelerations, angular velocities, and orientations 
of eight sensors with simulated signals from the model sensors. Additional 
constraints were enforced, reflecting physiological and biomechanical principles 
and targeting dynamic consistency. The objective of the IMU-based inverse 
kinematics was to minimize the difference between the input and simulated sensor 
orientations. The joint kinematics derived from both methods were compared 
against optical marker-based motion capture across a range of running speeds, 
evaluating the absolute and normalized root mean square errors.
RESULTS: Compared with motion-capture joint angles, optimal control simulations 
resulted in lower absolute errors (RMSE 8° ± 1) that were consistent across all 
speeds. IMU-based inverse kinematics exhibited greater differences with motion 
capture (RMSE 12° ± 1), which was more significant at faster speeds. The largest 
absolute inaccuracies were observed in the sagittal angles when not normalizing 
for the joint range of motion. The computational times for the optimal control 
were 46 ± 60 min, whereas they were 19.3 ± 3.7 s for the IMU-based inverse 
kinematics.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with traditional IMU-based inverse kinematics, the optimal 
control approach provides a more comparative representation of joint kinematics 
from optical motion capture. This method can mitigate errors associated with 
closely tracking IMU noise and drift, and it offers a dynamic analysis that 
considers the underlying forces and torques producing movement. However, these 
advantages come at the expense of challenges in parameter selection and 
computational cost.
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings highlight the potential of using IMUs with optimal 
control methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of gait dynamics across 
diverse applications. IMU-based inverse kinematics remains a viable option for 
faster computation and when model fidelity is less of a concern.

Stack height is a highly discussed key design feature of running shoes but its 
effects are not well understood. This study analyzed how shoe stack height and 
running speed influence full-body running coordination and motor variability 
structure using an uncontrolled manifold (UCM) analysis. The joint angle 
variability (i.e. elementary variables) was analyzed in terms of its effects on 
a synergy stabilizing the center of mass (CoM, i.e. performance variable). A 
total of 17 healthy experienced runners participated and ran at 10 and 15 km/h 
on a treadmill with three running shoes differing in stack height (H: 50 mm, M: 
35 mm, L: 27 mm). The UCM components (UCM||, UCM Ʇ & UCMratio) were compared 
with statistical parametric mapping rmANOVAs for different shoes and speeds. The 
shoes did not show significant effects for the three UCM components. With 
increasing speed from 10 to 15 km/h, the joint angle coordination variability 
affecting the CoM (UCMꞱ) increased and UCMratio decreased independent of the 
shoe condition. This indicated that stack height did not influence the motor 
variability structure. However, independent of the shoes, the variability 
affecting CoM increased which led to a weakened synergy stabilizing CoM 
(UCMratio). It can be suggested that the variations in the tested running speeds 
had a greater impact on the running coordination than those of the tested shoes 
within the UCM framework.

BACKGROUND: It is unclear how knee biomechanics in individuals with Sarcopenic 
Obesity and osteoarthritis (OA-SO) affect ambulation relative to those with knee 
osteoarthritis (OA) without SO. The primary objective of this study was to 
compare the knee kinematics and spatio-temporal gait parameters during treadmill 
walking using simulated terrain modifications in individuals with end-stage knee 
OA awaiting total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with SO and obesity (OA-SO group) 
versus those with knee OA without SO (OA group).
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of individuals with knee OA 
(with or without SO) awaiting TKA. Gait assessments using Computer-Assisted 
Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) occurred within one month before TKA; each 
participant was asked to perform two trials of self-selected treadmill speed for 
each of the following six walking conditions: (1) level; (2) uphill; (3) 
downhill; (4) cross slope with the affected body side elevated; (5) cross slope 
with the unaffected side elevated; and (6) medial-lateral walking surface 
translations. Data analyses compared demographics, gait kinematics, 
spatio-temporal, and clinical outcome measures between the groups using a 
two-tailed independent t-test for continuous measures and Chi Square tests for 
categorical data.
RESULTS: The groups were similar in age and sex distribution (P = 0.90 and 0.37, 
respectively). Of the 18 participants with knee OA, eight were classified as 
with and ten without SO. On the affected side, the group-level knee 
flexion-extension range was significantly larger in the OA group compared to 
OA-SO group for all six walking conditions during the full gait cycle. The OA 
group walked significantly faster than the OA-SO group for all walking 
conditions. The stride length and step length were significantly longer in the 
OA group than in the OA-SO group during four of the six walking conditions.
CONCLUSION: Gait assessment for different walking conditions adds important 
information to level walking assessments. Individuals with knee OA and SO have 
less knee range of motion, are slower, and less stride and step length, compared 
to individuals with OA only. This study may indicate the need for preoperative 
and postoperative rehabilitation programs to address the needs of individuals 
with knee OA and SO.

Lower body positive pressure treadmills (LBPPT) have gained increasing attention 
due to their potential applications in sports training, rehabilitation, and 
biomechanics research. However, there is limited understanding of how differing 
body weight percentages influence gait and force production. This study aimed to 
investigate the relationship between force and gait parameters at different body 
weight percentages on a LBPPT. Twenty-seven healthy participants completed a 
series of walking, jogging, and running trials at three different body weight 
conditions: 100%, 90%, and 75%. Gait parameters, including cadence, stride 
length, stance time, and ground reaction force, were measured using the 
Digitsole Pro foot insoles and analyzed across the different conditions. 
Repeated measures ANOVA and pairwise comparisons were used to examine the 
effects of body weight percentage on the gait parameters. The results showed 
significant effects of BW on cadence, stride length, stance time, and impact 
force during running condition (p < 0.001). Jogging condition was significantly 
different across all % BW for all variables except ground reaction force (GRF). 
For walking, the only significant differences presented were for stride length 
on the right limb between 100% and 90% BW (p = 0.004) and 100% and 75% BW (p = 
0.04) and time in stance on the left and right (p < 0.05). Pairwise comparisons 
revealed significant differences between the 100%, 90%, and 75% BW conditions 
for most gait parameters during jogging and running. These findings suggest that 
lower body weight percentages substantially influence gait mechanics and force 
production, especially as speed increases.

BACKGROUND: The impact of an amputation on the intact limb during walking is 
still unclear. By using vertical ground reaction forces (vGRF), recent reports 
suggested that not all amputees exhibit the classical M-shape. However, there is 
no study exploring these ""Non-M"" strides on both feet. The purpose of present 
study was to explore the vGRF time-course during gait and to quantify ""Non-M"" 
strides, their reproducibility and factors that could influence their 
apparition.
METHODS: vGRF of 29 controls and 23 unilateral lower-limb amputees were recorded 
during a 5-min walk at comfortable speed on an instrumented treadmill. Each 
stride was classified as ""M"" or ""Non-M"" to determine the percentage of ""Non-M"" 
strides per limb that were then compared between groups and limbs. The influence 
of age, time since amputation, speed, stance phase ASI, and type of prosthetic 
foot on the percentage of ""Non-M"" strides was tested. Comparisons between intact 
and prosthetic sides were made for duration of the stance phase and variability 
of vGRF patterns.
RESULTS: the percentage of ""Non-M"" strides was higher in the amputee group 
(p < 0.001) and higher in the intact limb compared to the prosthetic limb 
(p < 0.001). The analysis of the variables that could influence vGRF did not 
identify a cause. The amputees who also produced ""Non-M"" strides had higher 
variability in their vGRF patterns on the intact limb compared to those 
producing only ""M"" strides. This was not observed on the prosthetic side.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that the intact limb adapts in real-time to 
manage the body's movements, compensating for limits of prosthetic footwear. The 
global time-course of the vGRF (rather than the first peak) is a useful tool for 
studying the impact of the prosthesis on the intact limb.

The Effect of Wearable Robot-Assisted Gait Training on Balance and Walking 
Ability in Subacute Stroke Patients.

Kim Y, Baek S, Suram RP, Fatima R, An SL, Hong Y.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effectiveness of wearable robot-assisted 
gait training (W-RAGT) compared to treadmill gait training (TGT) for improving 
balance and walking ability in stroke patients.
DESIGN: Sixty stroke patients (67.13 ± 11.36 years; 37 males and 23 females) 
undergoing physical therapy were recruited from C Hospital in Seoul, Korea. 
Patients were randomly assigned to either the W-RAGT group (n = 30) or the TGT 
group (n = 30). Both groups received 30-minute training sessions three times a 
week for eight weeks. Balance ability was assessed using the L-symmetry, and BBS 
and motor recovery by FMA-LE. Cadence, step length, and stride length were 
measured to evaluate walking ability. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 16 
weeks.
RESULTS: After 8 weeks of treatment, the W-RAGT group demonstrated significant 
functional improvements in motor ability and balance (FMA-LE, p < 0.001; 
L-symmetry, p = 0.049; BBS, p < 0.001) and walking ability (cadence, p = 0.017; 
step length, p = 0.038; stride length, p = 0.042). At the 16 weeks follow-up, 
the W-RAGT group maintained significant gains in motor ability and balance 
(FMA-LE, p < 0.001; L-symmetry, p = 0.025; BBS, p = 0.011) and walking ability 
(cadence, p < 0.001; step length, p = 0.025; stride length, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The overground wearable robotic device used in this study, W-RAGT 
was found to be more effective than TGT in improving motor ability and balance, 
and walking ability in stroke patients.

Increased Gait Speed Changes Knee Mechanics Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament 
Reconstruction: Implications and Caution for Treadmill Training in Early 
Rehabilitation.

California.

BACKGROUND: Current rehabilitation practices following anterior cruciate 
ligament reconstruction (ACLr) do not guarantee recovery of gait mechanics 
suggesting that gait specific interventions are needed. Increasing gait speed 
implicitly increases lower extremity demands; however, it is not known if 
increased treadmill speed will result in improved knee mechanics in early 
recovery post-ACLr. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine how 
individuals four months post-ACLr respond to the demands of increased speed 
during treadmill gait.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
METHODS: Ten individuals 109.2±19.9 days post-ACLr and twelve uninjured 
individuals participated. Participants walked on a treadmill at self-selected 
(SS), 25% faster (SS25) and 50% faster (SS50) speeds. Kinematic and kinetic data 
were used to calculate net joint moments using standard inverse dynamic 
equations. Knee power was calculated as the scalar product of angular velocity 
and sagittal plane net joint moment. Knee flexion excursion was calculated from 
initial contact to the subsequent knee flexion peak. A 3 X 2 ANOVA assessed the 
effect of group and speed (SS, SS25, SS50) on surgical (or control) knee 
extensor moment, power absorption, knee excursion, GRFs and between limb 
symmetry.
RESULTS: For controls, knee extensor moment, power absorption, excursion, and 
GRFs increased at each speed. For ACLr, knee loading variables increased between 
SS to SS25 without changes in limb symmetry. No further increase in knee moments 
were observed between SS25 and SS50, but limb symmetry decreased in extensor 
moment, power, and GRFs.
CONCLUSION: At four months post-ACLr, a moderate increase in treadmill speed may 
provide a stimulus to improve knee loading without increased asymmetries. Larger 
increases in speed should be exercised with caution to avoid undesirable between 
limb compensations. A progressive increase in demand to improve knee loading 
deficits during early recovery of ACLr is warranted.

Automation of User Pace-Adjusted Treadmill: Comparison of Control Methods based 
on LRF Sensors.

Moreno BS, Mello RC, Frizera A.

Neurological disorders affect gait and posture, leading to significant 
difficulties in daily life. Traditional gait assessment lacks objective and 
quantifiable data, hindering comprehensive evaluation. To address these 
limitations, interactive and objective systems, such as smart walkers and 
specialized treadmills, have been developed utilizing advanced technologies to 
gather detailed gait data. This study focuses on evaluating two control 
strategies (A controller based on adaptive estimation of gait parameters and a 
PI controller-based systems) to automate a conventional treadmill, utilizing LRF 
sensors and the user's walking speed for personalized system control. The 
results demonstrate high adaptability of the control models to gait variations, 
surpassing reported walking speeds in the literature using these algorithms. 
These findings are relevant for enhancing user interaction and experience in 
rehabilitation applications and serious games, which can enable improvements in 
rehabilitation and human-machine interaction. Our results show that the strategy 
employing adaptive filters exhibits superior responsiveness, enabling adaptation 
to different treadmill speeds with greater ease.

Characterizing sEMG changes with muscle fatigue for lower-extremity prostheses 
and exoskeletons control.

Shang W, Huang R, Lin Y, Liang F, Yin M, Lu XP, Wu X, Gao F.

In powered lower limb prostheses and exoskeleton control, sEMG based methods 
have been widely explored and utilized due to non-invasive nature and ability to 
directly reflect user intentions. However, in practical use, neuromuscular 
fatigue (NMF) caused by long-term use can cause significant changes in sEMG 
signals. These issues are constraining sEMG's active prosthetics from the 
laboratory to real life. In this study, the changes in sEMG signals with muscle 
fatigue was investigated. sEMG data from one healthy subject and a below-knee 
amputee were logged and analyzed when they walked on a treadmill for a long 
time. They will experience from no NMF to NMF and then adapt to no NMF. A 
variational mode decomposition-based soft interval threshold (VMD-SIT) method 
was used to denoise the sEMG signals. Feature extraction methods were used to 
extract the features of the sEMG signal, and the distribution changes of these 
features during walking were analyzed. The results indicated that the NMF of the 
amputee was quite different from and more variable than that of the healthy 
subject, and the ratios of features' mean value of amputee and healthy are much 
higher in residual-limb side (12.35-26.18) than normal side (3.52-5.91).

Performance of Regression-Based Models for Real-Time Estimation of Anterior 
Ground Reaction Forces during Walking.

Glover N, Raffageau T, Sanders Q.

Diminished limb propulsive forces correlate with increased fall risk and reduced 
mobility. Gait biofeedback retraining, focusing on anteriorly directed ground 
reaction forces, holds promise for improving limb propulsive forces. However, 
the current reliance on bulky and expensive instrumented treadmills restricts 
its applicability beyond the laboratory. Inertial measurement units (IMUs), 
cost-effective alternatives to treadmills, have shown potential in offline 
estimation of ground reaction forces. Nevertheless, real-time estimation of 
anterior-posterior ground reaction forces (AGRFs) using IMUs remains unexplored. 
This study assessed the real-time efficacy of regression-based models for AGRF 
estimation during walking. Ten participants walked at varying speeds, while IMU 
and force plate data were recorded. Using 75% of the data for training, 
participant-specific models were generated and tested on the remaining 25% of 
trials without altering temporal parameters. Two regression models were created: 
an unweighted model and a weighted model. Model efficacy for braking and 
propulsion was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients, absolute 
error, minimal detectable change (MDC), and 95% confidence intervals. Model 
estimates of the AGRF times series were evaluated using R2 and normalized root 
mean squared error (NRMSE) values. While both models aligned well with collected 
data, they fell short in predicting peak propulsion force, surpassing the MDC. 
Model estimates of the AGRF time series also generated relatively low R2 values 
and relatively high NRMSE values. This performance was slightly inferior to 
real-time regression models for vertical ground reaction forces. These findings 
suggest leveraging deep learning-based approaches which may be better suited for 
handling time series data.

Gait Event Detection During Running Using a Bending Angle Sensor Attached to 
Loose-Fitting Clothing.

Goto D, Sakaue Y, Okada S, Shiozawa N.

The purpose of this study was to verify the accuracy of cycle time (tg) and 
contact time (tc) during running using a bending angle sensor attached to 
loose-fitting clothing in comparison with 3D motion capture data. For the 
measurements, 20 healthy adult males wore loose-fitting pants with a bending 
angle sensor attached to the right knee. They ran on a treadmill at 8, 10, and 
12 km/h for 90 s. A 3D motion capture device and the bending angle sensor 
simultaneously measured the right knee joint motion. Knee extension peaks for 
acquiring foot-strike and toe-off were detected from knee joint angular 
acceleration to acquire tg and tc from the sensor data. The absolute mean error 
(MAE), mean bias error (MBE), and root mean square error (RMSE) for tc and tg 
were obtained. The RMSE for tc was 21.4 ms at 8 km/h and less than 20 ms at 10 
and 12 km/h, while the MAE, MBE, and RMSE were all within 10 ms for tg. These 
results indicate that the bending angle sensor attached to loose-fitting 
clothing enables tg and tc detection.

The Effects of Robotic Exoskeleton Gait Training on Improving Walking 
Adaptability in Persons with MS.

Androwis GJ, Gaite A, Engler A, Yue GH, DeLuca J.

The goal of the present pilot investigation is to examine the effects of 8 weeks 
of supervised, over-ground gait training using a robotic exoskeleton (RE) 
compared with a control condition (conventional gait therapy, CGT) in persons 
with MS with ambulatory. Four female subjects (mean age=53 years) with 
relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) participated in this study and completed a total 
of sixteen sessions (1-hour/session) gait training in a standard therapy gym 
either using a RE supervised by a physical therapist (PT) trained with RE 
therapy (2 subjects) or with the CGT (2 subjects) supervised by a PT. Outcome 
measures (obstacle avoidance, ability to track augmented cues, and average 
walking speed while completing these dual-tasks) were measured for both groups 
on a smart, instrumented treadmill (C-Mill, Motekforce, Netherland) pre- and 
post-intervention without the RE. Overall, individuals with MS who underwent 
training with RE demonstrated improved walking adaptability (obstacle avoidance 
and augmented cues tracking) with no adverse events during the study, and 
improved average walking speed post training compared to baseline.Clinical 
Relevance- These preliminary results from four individuals with MS suggest that 
gait training with robotic exoskeleton may present an effective method for 
improving walking adaptability and average walking speed.

Gait Response to Rhythmic Cues: Influence of Adaptation Mechanisms and 
Entrainment Levels.

Hoque A, Kim SH, Reed KB.

This study categorizes the response to asymmetric rhythmic cues into distinct 
levels of adaptation using changes in their step velocity. Motion capture and 
force data were collected from healthy individuals undergoing split-belt 
treadmill and rhythmic cueing interventions. This allowed comparative insights 
into two distinct adaptation mechanisms (sensorimotor and instructional 
adaptation) corresponding to the interventions and integration of those findings 
with trade-off mechanisms within spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters. 
Interlimb gait harmony (corresponding to differences between left and right step 
velocities) was significantly different between the gait interventions, 
indicating underlying differences in the dominant adaptation mechanisms driving 
them. The trade-off mechanisms among step length, swing time, and push-off 
forces were significantly different (i) between the gait interventions and (ii) 
between adaptable and non-adaptable subject groups to external rhythmic cues. 
This suggests that an orthogonal linear relationship between propulsion and 
either spatial or temporal features may indicate the adaptation mechanism that 
has a greater contribution towards their motor outcome.

Experimental Evaluation of Machine Learning Models for Gait Segmentation.

Strick JA, Wiebrecht JJ, Farris RJ, Sawicki JT.

Accurate estimation of the gait phase is extremely important in exoskeleton 
control, as various stages in the gait cycle require different control 
objectives. This study involved the evaluation of seven machine learning models 
utilizing inertial measurement unit and joint angle data from eight healthy 
subjects wearing the Ekso Indego exoskeleton for the purpose of gait 
segmentation. During the experiments, subjects walked on a level instrumented 
treadmill with gravity compensation assistance for three trials and underwent a 
fourth trial simulating impairment. A six-state model of gait was employed, 
where bilateral heel strike, toe off, and tibia vertical determined state 
transitions. True state transitions were determined using optical motion capture 
and ground reaction force data. Of the evaluated models, the Support Vector 
Machine achieved the highest performance, with an average accuracy of 94.5% and 
94.1% for normal walking and impaired walking, respectively. Future research 
should focus on assessing the model's real-time performance among exoskeleton

Custom Ankle-Foot Orthosis in Foot Drop: Influence on Body Joints Kinematics.

Amitrano F, Coccia A, Riano FC, Pagano G, Marsico V, D'Addio G.

Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFOs) are external supports typically prescribed in 
clinical practice to address foot drop deficits. Lower limb orthoses have been 
shown to have positive effects on spatio-temporal gait metrics, while the impact 
on body joint kinematics is less clear and varies in the literature. The 
objective of this study is to investigate the presence of a common movement 
pattern in body joints that compensates for the foot drop deficit. The study 
focuses on the trunk, knee, and hip joints. Eight patients with unilateral foot 
drop participated in walking trials on an instrumented treadmill. The trials 
included testing with both a conventional and a 3D printed custom passive AFO. 
The study results indicate that the use of AFOs on the impaired foot did not 
have a significant effect on joint kinematics in the study population, except 
for an improvement in trunk anterior flexion provided by the custom orthosis. 
There is evidence of altered biomechanics that cannot be corrected by passive 
orthoses alone. The study highlights the importance of physical training and 
long-term re-education of the patient in the correct use of the orthosis.

Ground Reaction Forces and Moments in Stroke Survivors: Experimental versus 
AnyBody Model Predictions.

Vaqar Hulleck AA, Abdullah M, Hamed F, Katmah R, Khalaf K, Rich ME.

Multibody dynamics models and simulations offer an efficient alternative to 
traditional methods, such as force plates, pressure sensing mats, and 
instrumented treadmills, for computing ground reaction forces (GRF) and moments 
(GRM), valuable in the quantification of the gait of neurological patients. 
Accurate determination of GRF and GRM magnitudes, with a specific focus on the 
disruptive shear components affecting gait, is essential for post-stroke gait 
assessment and rehabilitation. This study explored the predictive capability of 
musculoskeletal models equipped with foot contact elements, by comparing them 
with experimental data from a published dataset. The results yielded peak 
normalized Root Mean Square Errors (n-RMSE) of 0.51±0.31% and 0.46±0.28% for 
mediolateral shear components, 0.4±0.13% and 0.35±0.16% for anteroposterior 
shear components, and 0.34±0.16% and 0.32±0.12% for compressive components of 
GRF for the right and left foot respectively. For GRM, nRMSE peaks in the 
sagittal plane were 4.72±3.55%, followed by 2.51±2% in the frontal plane, and 
2±1.44% in the transverse plane for the right foot. On the left side, nRMSE 
peaks were 3.73±3.12% in sagittal plane, 2.75±2.7% in frontal plane, and 2.65±2% 
in the transverse plane. This study underscores the potential of musculoskeletal 
modeling and simulation software, such as AnyBody, as a time and cost-effective 
alternative for evaluating the biomechanics of stroke survivors.

In a recent human study, we found that adaptive changes in step length asymmetry 
(SLA) are correlated with similar changes in the H-reflex gains of the leg 
muscles during split-belt treadmill locomotion. Although this observation 
indicated a closer link between gait asymmetry and spinal reflex adaptation, it 
did not reveal their causal relationship. To better understand this 
relationship, here we use a neuromuscular model of human walking whose control 
relies primarily on spinal reflexes. Subjecting the model to split-belt 
treadmill locomotion with different combinations of belt speed and reflex gain 
patterns, we find that belt speed changes increase the variability in SLA but do 
not result in consistent SLA patterns as observed in human experiments, whereas 
reflex gain changes do. Furthermore, we find that the model produces SLA 
patterns similar to healthy adults when its reflex gains are adapted in a way 
similar to the H-reflex changes we observed in our previous study. The model 
also predicts SLA patterns similar to the ones observed for cerebellar 
degeneration patients when the reflexes do not adapt beyond a sudden dip at the 
time the ipsilateral belt speed is lowered. Our results suggest that SLA does 
not arise from imposing belt speed changes but requires the change of the reflex 
gains and that the dynamic adjustment of these gains may be an essential part of 
human gait control when encountering unexpected environmental changes such as 
uneven speed changes in split-belt treadmill locomotion.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This 
work uses computational modeling to investigate the role of spinal reflex tuning 
during locomotor adaptation. We show, in simulation, that tuning spinal reflex 
gains leads to gait asymmetry adaptation, not vice versa, and that patterns of 
gait adaptation on a split-belt treadmill are mostly driven by tuning of spinal 
reflexes, and not by biomechanical disturbances triggered by belt changes. The 
model further hints at the cerebellum as the source of spinal reflex modulation.

Development of a Wearable Sleeve-Based System Combining Polymer Optical Fiber 
Sensors and an LSTM Network for Estimating Knee Kinematics.

Pugliese BL, Angelucci A, Parisi F, Sapienza S, Fabara E, Corniani G, Tenforde 
AS, Aliverti A, Demarchi D, Bonato P.

This study presents a novel wearable solution integrating Polymer Optical Fiber 
(POF) sensors into a knee sleeve to monitor knee flexion/extension (F/E) 
patterns during walking. POF sensors offer advantages such as flexibility, light 
weight, and robustness to electromagnetic interference, making them ideal for 
wearable applications. However, when one integrates these sensors into a knee 
sleeve, they exhibit non-linearities, including hysteresis and mode coupling, 
which complicate signal interpretation. To address this issue, a Long Short-Term 
Memory (LSTM) network was implemented to model temporal dependencies in sensor 
output, hence providing accurate knee angle estimates. Data were collected from 
31 participants walking at different speeds on a treadmill, using a camera-based 
motion capture system for validation. Configurations with multiple (up to five) 
sensors were considered. The best performance was achieved using three sensors, 
yielding a median root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.41° (interquartile range: 
2.50° - $5.19^{\circ }\text {)}$ . Whereas using multiple sensors generally 
improved robustness, the inclusion of data from sub-optimally placed sensors 
negatively affected performance. The technology holds potential for clinical 
application in knee osteoarthritis (OA) management. Future work should focus on 
optimizing signal calibration and expanding the dataset to facilitate accounting 
for the different ways in which the knee sleeve conforms to the anatomy of 
different individuals.

Effect of Feedback on Foot Strike Angle and Forward Propulsion in People With 
Stroke.

Ensink CJ, Hofstad CJ, van Ee R, Keijsers NLW.

Effective retraining of foot elevation and forward propulsion is essential in 
stroke survivors' gait rehabilitation. This study aimed to investigate the 
effect of providing real-time feedback on foot strike angle (FSA) and forward 
propulsion in people with stroke. Twelve stroke survivors completed five walking 
trials on an instrumented treadmill: 1) regular walking (one); 2) feedback on 
FSA; 3) feedback on propulsion; 4) feedback on both FSA and propulsion; and 5) 
regular walking (two). Visual feedback was presented through a green-to-red 
vertical slide bar on a screen in front of the participants. Linear mixed models 
evaluated the impact of feedback on FSA and propulsion, considering the sequence 
of feedback delivery, and potential learning or fatigue effects over the trials. 
Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were performed to assess the effect of different 
feedback types. Linear mixed models revealed a main effect on FSA and propulsion 
by feedback on FSA and propulsion, respectively. FSA significantly increased 
from 16.6° in the initial regular walking trial to 24.0° during FSA feedback and 
23.6° during combined FSA and propulsion feedback trials (p<0.001). Forward 
propulsion significantly improved by one third in the feedback on propulsion and 
combined feedback on both FSA and propulsion conditions compared to the first 
regular walking trial (p<0.001). The positive effect of real-time feedback on 
FSA and forward propulsion highlight the potential of using technology to tailor 
rehabilitation strategies in stroke survivors.

Biomechanically, falling after a walking perturbation may be influenced by: (1) 
the pre-perturbation state of mechanical stability (e.g., stability margins) and 
(2) the response to a perturbation (i.e., recovery skill). Walking stability 
margins must be modifiable to serve as a target for fall-prevention 
interventions. We investigated if neurotypical adults could proactively modulate 
pre-perturbation anteroposterior stability margins while walking. Eleven adults 
walked on a treadmill at three speeds with and without anterior and posterior 
perturbations. We measured stability margins anteriorly at mid-swing and 
posteriorly at foot strike for pre-perturbation steps. A repeated-measures 
factorial ANOVA evaluated main effects and interactions of walking speed (0.6, 
0.8, 1.0 stats/s) and perturbation type (anterior, none, posterior). With 
posterior perturbation threats, the posterior stability margins were more 
positive at foot strike (p < 0.01) compared to trials without perturbations. 
With anterior perturbation threats, the anterior stability margins were not 
different at mid-swing compared to trials without perturbations (p > 0.05). With 
any perturbation threat, step lengths shortened (p < 0.01) and step rates 
increased (p < 0.01). Step width was not different (p > 0.11). At slow speeds 
with posterior perturbation threats, double-support time decreased (p = 0.04). 
Proactive modifications to stability margins are indeed possible in a 
neurotypical population. Consequently, anteroposterior stability margins may be 
a feasible target for fall-prevention interventions by targeting decreased step 
lengths or increased step rates within a given walking speed. We do not know the 
extent to which the observed effects have a meaningful effect on perturbation 
recovery.

Transcutaneous Spinal Stimulation and Short-Burst Interval Treadmill Training in 
Children With Cerebral Palsy: A Pilot Study.

Shrivastav SR, DeVol CR, Landrum VM, Bjornson KF, Roge D, Steele KM, Moritz CT.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of 
transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) and short-burst interval locomotor 
treadmill training (SBLTT) on spasticity and mobility in children with cerebral 
palsy (CP).
METHODS: We employed a single-arm design with two interventions: SBLTT only, and 
tSCS + SBLTT, in four children with CP. Children received 24-sessions each of 
SBLTT only and tSCS + SBLTT. Spasticity, neuromuscular coordination, and walking 
function were evaluated before, immediately after, and 8-weeks following each 
intervention.
RESULTS: Spasticity, measured via the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), reduced in 
four lower-extremity muscles after tSCS + SBLTT (1.40 ± 0.22), more than 
following SBLTT only (0.43 ± 0.39). One-minute walk test (1-MWT) distance was 
maintained during both interventions. tSCS + SBLTT led to improvements in peak 
hip and knee extension (4.9 ± 7.3° and 6.5 ± 7.7°), that drove increases in 
joint dynamic range of 4.3 ± 2.4° and 3.8 ± 8.7° at the hip and knee, 
respectively. Children and parents reported reduction in fatigue and improved 
gait outcomes after tSCS + SBLTT. Improvements in spasticity and walking 
function were sustained for 8-weeks after tSCS + SBLTT.
CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that tSCS + SBLTT may improve 
spasticity while simultaneously maintaining neuromuscular coordination and 
walking function in ambulatory children with CP.
SIGNIFICANCE: This work provides preliminary evidence on the effects of tSCS and 
the combination of tSCS + SBLTT in children with CP.

PURPOSE: Locomotor high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to 
improve walking capacity (speed and endurance) more than moderate-intensity 
aerobic training (MAT) after stroke, but it is unclear which training 
parameter(s) should be prioritized (e.g. speed, heart rate, blood lactate, step 
count) and to what extent walking capacity gains are the result of gait changes 
versus cardiorespiratory adaptations. This study aimed to assess which training 
parameters and longitudinal adaptations most strongly mediate 6-minute walk 
distance (6MWD) gains from post-stroke HIIT.
METHODS: The HIT-Stroke Trial randomized 55 persons with chronic stroke and 
walking limitations to HIIT or MAT; each involving overground and treadmill 
walking, 45 minutes, 3 times/week for 12 weeks. HIIT used short maximum speed 
intervals, targeting >60% heart rate reserve (HRR). MAT targeted 40-60% HRR. 
Blinded outcomes included 6MWD, short-distance gait function (e.g. fastest 
10-meter gait speed) and aerobic capacity (e.g. ventilatory threshold). This 
ancillary analysis used structural equation models to compare mediating effects 
of different training parameters and longitudinal adaptations on 6MWD changes.
RESULTS: Net gains in 6MWD from HIIT versus MAT were primarily mediated by 
faster training speeds (+57 meters, p < .0001) and longitudinal gait adaptations 
(+37 meters, p = .0005). Training step count was also positively associated with 
6MWD gains, but was lower with HIIT versus MAT, which decreased the net 6MWD 
gain from HIIT (-14 meters, p = .02). HIIT generated higher training heart rate 
and lactate than MAT, but aerobic capacity gains were similar between groups, 
and 6MWD changes were not associated with training heart rate, training lactate, 
or aerobic adaptations.
CONCLUSIONS: To increase walking capacity with post-stroke HIIT, training speed 
and step count appear to be the most important parameters to prioritize.

The ability to adapt to unexpected changes in environments is associated with 
the risk of running-related injuries. Although gait retraining programs can 
mitigate injury risk, there is a scarcity of studies focusing on neuromechanical 
adaptations during running with unpredictable perturbations. Hence, the current 
experiment aimed to analyse spatial-temporal and muscle activity adaptation 
during a perturbed running protocol. 23 participants performed a 5-minute 
unperturbed and an 8-minute perturbed running trial with a baseline velocity of 
2.5 m/s. During the perturbation protocol, 30-one-sided decelerative 
perturbations were randomly applied to both legs. Spatial-temporal data and 
muscle activity of twelve lower extremity and trunk muscles were recorded during 
unperturbed and perturbed steps. Linear mixed models with repeated measures were 
applied to identify adaptation at any time point in the data. Statistical 
analysis indicated adaptation to the perturbation trial in comparison to 
baseline trial for step duration, length, width and upper- and lower-leg 
muscles. Adaptations characterized by decreased step duration and length and 
increased step width and muscle activity. This study has demonstrated 
participants' ability to adapt their movement and muscle activity patterns while 
running with unpredictable perturbations. Therefore, introducing more diverse or 
novel perturbation stimuli to the human system may be necessary to continually 
challenge adaptation.

BACKGROUND: Consumer-grade wearables are becoming increasingly popular in 
research and in clinical contexts. These technologies hold significant promise 
for advancing digital medicine, particularly in remote and rural areas in 
low-income settings like sub-Saharan Africa, where climate change is 
exacerbating health risks. This study evaluates the data agreement between 
consumer-grade and research-established devices under standardized conditions.
METHODS: Twenty-two participants (11 women, 11 men) performed a structured 
protocol, consisting of six different activity phases (sitting, standing, and 
the first four stages of the classic Bruce treadmill test). We collected heart 
rate, (core) body temperature, step count, and energy expenditure. Each variable 
was simultaneously tracked by consumer-grade and established research-grade 
devices to evaluate the validity of the consumer-grade devices. We statistically 
compared the data agreement using Pearson's correlation r, Lin's concordance 
correlation coefficient (LCCC), Bland-Altman method, and mean absolute 
percentage error.
RESULTS: A good agreement was found between the wrist-worn Withings Pulse HR 
(consumer-grade) and the chest-worn Faros Bittium 180 in measuring heart rate 
while sitting, standing, and slow walking on a treadmill at a speed of 2.7 km/h 
(r ≥ 0.82, |bias| ≤ 3.1 bpm), but this decreased with increasing speed (r ≤ 
0.33, |bias| ≤ 11.7 bpm). The agreement between the Withing device and the 
research-established device worn on the wrist (GENEActiv) for measuring the 
number of steps also decreased during the treadmill phases (first stage: r = 
0.48, bias = 0.6 steps/min; fourth stage: r = 0.48, bias = 17.3 steps/min). 
Energy expenditure agreement between the Withings device and the indirect 
calorimetry method was poor during the treadmill test (|r| ≤ 0.29, |bias | ≥ 1.7 
MET). The Tucky thermometer under the armpit (consumer-grade) and the Tcore 
sensor on the forehead were found to be in poor agreement in measuring (core) 
body temperature during resting phases (r ≤ 0.53, |bias| ≥ 0.8°C) and 
deteriorated during the treadmill test.
CONCLUSION: The Withings device showed adequate performance for heart rate at 
low activity levels and step count at higher activity levels, but had limited 
overall accuracy. The Tucky device showed poor agreement with the Tcore in all 
six different activity phases. The limited accuracy of consumer-grade devices 
suggests caution in their use for rigorous research, but points to their 
potential utility in capture general physiological trends in long-term field 
monitoring or population-health surveillance.

BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of falls has been reported in individuals with 
upper limb absence (ULA). This prevalence is increased in upper limb prosthesis 
users. It is possible that ULA and prosthesis use may alter recovery mechanisms 
in response to a perturbation.
RESEARCH QUESTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the reactive 
response of individuals with unilateral transradial ULA to perturbations during 
walking compared to control participants, and to determine the effect of 
prosthesis use on perturbation response strategies and resultant dynamics.
METHODS: 10 upper limb prosthesis users and 10 matched able-bodied control 
participants completed two walking treadmill tasks: 1) a steady-state walking 
baseline trial at 1.0 m/s, and 2) 12 perturbation trials containing an 
unexpected, rapid treadmill belt acceleration and deceleration while walking. 
Six perturbations were delivered to each leg during single limb stance. 
Prosthesis users completed both tasks with and without their customary 
prosthesis. Whole-body angular momentum ranges (Lrange) in each plane during 
baseline and perturbation response were compared between prosthesis users and 
controls using one-sided independent t-tests. A two-way repeated measures 
ANCOVA, with years of prosthesis use modeled as a covariate, assessed the main 
and interaction effects of prosthesis use and perturbation side of Lrange in 
three planes, and shoulder add-abduction and flexion-extension ranges in 
prosthesis users.
RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Prosthesis users exhibited greater Lrange than 
controls during baseline and perturbation response, in the sagittal-plane only. 
Lrange during perturbation response was significantly greater when the 
prosthesis was not worn, also in the sagittal-plane only. Perturbations may 
present a greater recovery challenge to people with transradial ULA partially 
due to a mass and inertia imbalance between the sound and impaired limbs when 
not wearing a prosthesis. Holistic rehabilitation regimes including both 
prosthesis and balance training should be considered for ULA populations.

We tested the hypothesis that due to well recognized thermoregulatory 
impairments, resulting in greater thermal strain, adults with well healed burn 
injuries will have heightened cardiovascular responses to exercise in the heat. 
Adults with burn injuries covering 20-40% body surface area (n = 10), > 40% body 
surface area (n = 11), and non-burned controls (n = 10) performed 1 h of 
treadmill walking at a fixed rate of metabolic heat production (~ 4.5 w/kg) in 
the heat (39 °C, 40% relative humidity). Core temperature, heart rate, stroke 
volume, and blood pressure were obtained at rest and during exercise. The 
increase in core temperature was 0.89 ± 0.40 °C for control, 0.92 ± 0.43 °C for 
20-40%, and 1.30 ± 0.58 °C for > 40% (interaction: p = .08). Ending heart rate 
was greater in > 40% compared to control (142 ± 27 vs 118 ± 9 bpm; p = .03), 
however there was no difference between 20-40% and control (128 ± 24 vs 
118 ± 9 bpm; p = .44). Ending rate pressure product was higher in the > 40% 
compared to control (21,326 ± 4327 vs 15,971 ± 2156 mmHg*bpm; p = .007), however 
there was no difference between 20-40% and control (18,698 ± 3741 vs 
15,971 ± 2156 mmHg*bpm; p = .16). At 45-min into exercise, cardiac minute work 
was higher in the > 40% compared to control (577 ± 102 vs 467 ± 63 
L/min*mmHg/m2; p = .02), but there was no difference between 20-40% and control 
(513 ± 82 vs 467 ± 63 L/min*mmHg/m2; p = .36). These findings show that 
well-healed burn survivors with large burn injuries, such as those 
covering > 40% of total body surface area, have increased cardiovascular strain 
during exercise heat stress.

Movement smoothness is a critical metric for evaluating motor control and 
sensorimotor impairments, with increasing relevance in neurorehabilitation and 
everyday functional assessments. This study investigates the correlation between 
two smoothness metrics (Log Dimensionless Jerk): LDLJV, derived from body center 
of mass (BCoM) trajectories using a gold-standard stereophotogrammetric system, 
and LDLJA, calculated from acceleration data recorded via an inertial 
measurement unit (IMU) placed at the L1-L2 level. Ten healthy adults (six men 
and four women; height: 1.71 ± 0.08 m; body mass: 68.2 ± 10.2 kg; age: 34.5 ± 
8.5 years) walked on a treadmill at seven different speeds, with stride-specific 
data analyzed to compute smoothness indices for three anatomical components 
(antero-posterior, medio-lateral, cranio-caudal). Concordance between the 
metrics was evaluated using Bland-Altman analysis, Spearman's correlation, and 
the mean absolute percentage error. The results revealed weak correlations and 
substantial biases across all components and speeds, reflecting inherent 
differences between IMU- and BCoM-derived data. Correcting biases improved 
alignment but did not eliminate discrepancies. The findings highlight that LDLJA 
captures only localized trunk accelerations, whereas BCoM-derived LDLJV 
approximates whole-body dynamics, making direct substitution infeasible. This 
study emphasizes the need for careful interpretation of IMU-based metrics and 
contributes to refining their application in real-world gait analyses.

Background and Objectives: Weight-bearing activities exacerbate pain and fatigue 
in functional flat foot, with uphill walking presenting additional challenges 
due to increased external loads. The current study investigates whether 
3D-printed customized arch-support insoles can enhance gait variables and ankle 
alignment during uphill walking. Materials and Methods: Twenty healthy young 
adults, divided into two groups (normal foot condition (control, n = 10), 
functional flat foot (FF, n = 10)), walked on a treadmill at a 10% incline under 
two conditions: wearing shoes alone (shoe) or wearing shoes with 3D-printed 
customized arch-support insoles (SI). Gait pattern, center of force (COF), and 
ankle joint angles were analyzed by OptoGait, Tekscan, and Kinovea, 
respectively. Results: The foot flat phase of the gait pattern was prolonged in 
individuals with FF compared to the control under both shoe and SI conditions, 
whereas the propulsive phase was shortened with the SI. Medial deviation of the 
COF during the propulsive phase, observed in individuals with FF under the shoe 
condition, was corrected to a more lateral alignment with the SI, resembling the 
COF alignment of the control. Additionally, individuals with FF under the shoe 
condition exhibited increased ankle pronation compared to the control, whereas 
the SI moderated pronation, achieving alignment closer to that of the control. 
Conclusions: These findings indicate that the 3D-printed customized arch-support 
insoles can improve gait mechanics and ankle alignment in individuals with FF, 
particularly under challenging conditions such as uphill walking.

This study aimed to compare the effects of Pilates (PIL) and whole-body 
high-intensity interval training (WBHIIT) on the spinal curvature of sedentary 
women. After being invited, 26 sedentary women aged between 20 and 54 
voluntarily agreed to participate in the study. The sample was obtained through 
convenience sampling, and the participants chose either PIL or WBHIIT, which 
resulted in 13 participants in each group. Spinal posture was assessed pre- and 
post-intervention through videogrammetry during standing and walking. Markers 
were placed on the back, and the volunteers were instructed to remain in a 
standing position on a stationary treadmill for ten seconds. Subsequently, the 
treadmill was activated at a speed of 5 km/h. After one minute of walking, a 
complete gait cycle was recorded for analysis. The results showed no significant 
changes in spinal angles in static position between groups. However, in the 
walking position, there was a large-magnitude increase in the spinal range of 
motion (ROM) post-intervention (PIL Lumbar d = 1.8; PIL Thoracic d = 2.9; WBHIIT 
Lumbar d = 1.0; WBHIIT Thoracic d = 3.5) within groups in the sagittal plane. 
The adaptations promoted by these interventions in spinal ROM are important for 
reducing the risks of spinal stiffness and pain due to sedentary behaviour.

Stiff-Knee gait (SKG) commonly occurs in individuals after stroke, loosely 
defined as reduced peak knee flexion angle during swing. The causes of SKG are 
multifaceted and debated. Further, clinical interventions have not been 
consistently effective, possibly resulting from multiple undiagnosed subtypes of 
SKG. Thus, our primary goal of this study is to explore the existence of 
potential subtypes associated with different levels of motor control complexity. 
We used retrospective kinematics, kinetics and muscle activity from 50 stroke 
survivors and 15 healthy, age-matched controls during treadmill walking. We used 
a time-series kernel k-means cluster analysis based on compensatory frontal 
plane kinematics associated with SKG to separate participants into three groups, 
Cluster A (hip hiking, lowest knee flexion, highest propulsion asymmetry, lowest 
gait speed), Cluster B (hip hiking and hip abduction, moderate knee flexion, 
middle gait speed) and Cluster C (highest knee flexion, highest gait speed). The 
highest proportion of individuals with SKG as diagnosed by a clinician were in 
Cluster A, but with a substantial proportion in Cluster B, indicating that these 
two clusters can be considered subtypes of SKG. Despite differences in 
kinematics and kinetics, we did not observe fundamental differences in 
underlying motor control between clusters as determined by non-negative matrix 
factorization of measured muscle activations. We conclude that the differences 
between clusters were most likely attributed to the severity of gait impairment, 
as reflected by slower gait speed and propulsion asymmetry, rather than being a 
different type of SKG.

BACKGROUND: Achilles tendon rupture rehabilitation protocols often emphasize two 
key factors, namely plantar flexion and load restriction during the early 
recovery stages. However, we hypothesize that variations in walking speed also 
play a significant role in affecting the load on the Achilles tendon. This study 
aims to explore the combined impact of plantar flexion angle and walking speed 
on the surface electromyography (EMG) activity of the calf muscles.
METHODS: Surface EMG measurements on 24 healthy volunteers assessed the activity 
of the calf muscles (gastrocnemius lateralis, gastrocnemius medialis, and 
soleus). Participants walked on a treadmill using two designs of ankle foot 
orthoses set at three different angles of the ankle joint (mainly 0°, 15°, or 
30° plantar flexion), as well as barefoot and in sports shoes. The tests were 
performed at full loads of 1, 2 and 4 km/h or with additional measurements at 1 
and 2 km/h with a partial load of 20 kg. The walking speed of 4 km/h in sports 
shoes was used as reference, corresponding to the maximum load on the calf 
muscles during walking.
RESULTS: Both orthoses demonstrated a significant reduction in EMG activity by 
more than half even at a 0° setting and 1 km/h compared to walking barefoot or 
in sports shoes. However, as walking speed increased to 2 km/h and especially to 
4 km/h, EMG activity significantly increased, approaching the level of walking 
with sports shoes at 1 km/h. The results indicated that even minor changes in 
walking speed had a significant impact on muscle activity, underscoring the 
importance of this parameter.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that walking speed should be considered a 
crucial factor in rehabilitation protocols for Achilles tendon ruptures, 
alongside plantar flexion and load restrictions, to optimize recovery outcomes.

Background/Objectives: This clinical trial aimed to determine whether 
perturbation-based gait training (PBGT) on a split-belt treadmill enhances 
balance and muscle strength in older adults, comparing its effectiveness with 
walking-only training on a treadmill. Methods: This single-center, prospective, 
single-blind (assessor), randomized controlled trial included 24 older adults 
from the Rehabilitation Center of Jeonbuk National University Hospital. 
Participants were equally divided into the PBGT and control groups. Both groups 
underwent 12 training sessions, three times a week for 4 weeks, for a total of 
43 min per session. The outcomes, including the Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test 
(FTSST), Falls Efficacy Scale International, timed up-and-go (TUG) test, 
functional reach test, and lower-extremity manual muscle test scores, were 
measured at three time points: pre-training, post-training, and four weeks after 
training. Results: While there were no significant differences between the two 
groups, the PBGT group demonstrated significant improvements in its FTSST and 
TUG values. Conclusions: Unpredictable perturbation training on a split-belt 
treadmill can be safely performed by older adults and may serve as an 
alternative exercise method to enhance physical performance and balance ability 
for fall prevention.

BACKGROUND: Curiosity and decentering are two constructs that represent 
momentary mindfulness. Dance is an art and complex physical activity mode, which 
may serve as a behavioral correlate of mindfulness.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize momentary mindfulness in relation to a novel, 
accelerometer-derived measure for characterizing human movement quality (i.e. 
""dance-like state"" DLS scores).
METHODS: Adults (N = 41), ages 18-83 years old, engaged in the following 
conditions in a lab and completed questionnaires on mindfulness after each: (1) 
clipping their fingernails; (2) sitting, standing, and walking on a treadmill; 
and (3) dancing at self-determined reference intensities with and without music. 
Conditions 2-3 were monitored with accelerometers. DLS score summary statistics 
(i.e. median and median amplitude deviation [MAD]) were used in linear mixed 
effects models.
RESULTS: On average, curiosity [13.7(1.02)] was significantly associated with 
median DLS scores (β = 1.79, p = 0.007) over time; adults with a lower median 
DLS score reported higher levels of curiosity [16.2; 95%C.I. 13.3-19.0], on 
average, when compared [12.6; 95%C.I., 10.3-14.9] to adults with a higher median 
DLS score. On average, decentering [14.9(1.01)] was significantly associated 
with the DLS score MAD (β = 1.28, p = 0.035) over time; adults who had less 
variability in DLS scores across conditions reported greater experiences of 
decentering [15.9; 95%C.I. 13.7-18.1], on average, when compared [13.3; 95%C.I. 
10.7-15.9] to adults with more variability in DLS scores across conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Among ostensibly healthy adults, movement quality was correlated 
with momentary mindfulness. Additional research is needed to understand if DLS 
scores are differentially associated with momentary mindfulness among adults 
with Alzheimer's disease.

Previous work has shown that compared with young adults, older adults generalize 
their walking patterns more across environments that impose different motor 
demands (i.e., split-belt treadmill vs. overground). However, in this previous 
study, all participants walked at a speed that was more comfortable for older 
adults than young participants, which leads to the question of whether young 
adults would generalize more their walking patterns than older adults when 
exposed to faster speeds that are more comfortable for them. To address this 
question, we examined the interaction between healthy aging and walking speed on 
the generalization of a pattern learned on a split-belt treadmill (i.e., legs 
moving at different speeds) to overground. We hypothesized that walking speed 
during split-belt walking regulates the generalization of walking patterns in an 
age-specific manner. To this end, groups of young (<30 yr old) and older (65+ yr 
old) adults adapted their gait on a split-belt treadmill at either slower or 
faster walking speeds. We assessed the generalization of movements between the 
groups by quantifying their aftereffects during overground walking, where larger 
overground aftereffects represent more generalization, and zero aftereffects 
represent no generalization. We found an interaction between age and walking 
speed in the generalization of walking patterns. More specifically, older adults 
generalized more when adapted at slower speeds, whereas younger adults did so 
when adapted at faster speeds. These results suggest that comfortable walking 
speeds lead to more generalization of newly acquired motor patterns beyond the 
training contexts.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The generalization of motor learning in 
humans depends on both internal factors, such as age, and external factors 
imposed by experimenters, like treadmill speeds. However, the interaction 
between these factors remains unclear. Our study revealed that older adults 
showed increased generalization when adapting to slower speeds, whereas younger 
adults exhibited this behavior at faster speeds. This implies that walking at 
unusual speeds acts as a contextual cue, restricting the generalization of motor 
patterns.

Recent work revealed that recreational ballet practice reduces older adults' 
fall risk after a standing-slip perturbation. However, whether such ballet 
practice can lead to decreased falls and better reactive motor control after a 
gait-slip among older adults remains unclear. This study investigated whether 
ballet reduces older adults' gait-slip falls and the possible neuromuscular and 
biomechanical mechanisms responsible for fall risk reduction. Protected by a 
safety harness, 15 older recreational ballet dancers and 21 age- and sex-matched 
non-dancers experienced a single unexpected slip while walking on a treadmill. 
The slip acceleration, duration, and displacement were standardized at 8 m/s2, 
0.2 s, and 16 cm, respectively. Motion and electromyography data were collected 
during the gait-slip trial. The outcomes included slip-faller rate as the 
primary outcome and the following secondary ones: dynamic gait stability, 
slipping foot displacement, recovery stepping performance, trunk movement, and 
recovery leg muscle electromyography latency (rectus femoris, biceps femoris, 
medial gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior). The results revealed that fewer 
dancers fell after the gait-slip (p = 0.029). Dancers displayed better stability 
at recovery foot touchdown (p = 0.012), a longer (p = 0.002) and faster 
(p = 0.009) step, shorter slipping foot displacement (p = 0.031), less backward 
trunk velocity at touchdown (p = 0.011), and shorter latencies for all four 
muscles (p≤0.038). The results suggest that older dancers are more resilient to 
an unexpected gait-slip and display better reactive balance control responding 
to the slip perturbation, which could be related to their more effective 
recovery stepping, better trunk movement control, and faster leg muscle 
activations.

Introduction: Exercise transcutaneous oximetry (Ex-TcpO2) is used to support the 
vascular origin of lower-limb pain, or to assess walking impairment. The aim of 
this study was to describe the association between Ex-TcpO2 measurement and the 
perioperative clinical and morphological outcomes after revascularization in 
patients with intermittent claudication (IC). Methods: From January to December 
2022, a single-center prospective observational study was conducted among 
patients with IC. Patients were referred by vascular surgeons for Ex-TcpO2 for 
doubtful arterial origin. Perioperative clinical and morphological outcomes were 
assessed by the Rutherford-Becker classification and duplex ultrasound 
examination. The primary patency rate and primary sustained clinical improvement 
were evaluated at 1 month after revascularization. Results: Eighty-two patients 
(64% men) underwent Ex-TcpO2 and were enrolled in the study, of whom 65% were 
category III of the Rutherford classification. Indications for Ex-TcpO2 were to 
assess the origin of the IC symptoms in 65%. Sixty-seven (81%) patients had 
positive Ex-TcpO2, and 15 (18%) had negative Ex-TcpO2. Patients with positive 
Ex-TcpO2 were older (65 ± 13 vs 58 ± 20, p = 0.43), and had a significantly 
lower ankle-brachial index (ABI) compared to the negative group (0.65 ± 0.22 vs 
0.92 ± 0.22, p < 0.001) as well as a lower maximum walking distance (MWD) (200 m 
[150, 300] vs 525 m [500, 872], p < 0.001). Forty-two patients underwent 
revascularization (Ex-TcpO2 positive [n = 35/67]; Ex-TcpO2 negative [n = 7/15]). 
Revascularization technical success and primary patency rate were 100% in both 
groups. Clinical improvement was significantly greater in the Ex-TcpO2 positive 
group (97% [n = 34/35] vs 0% [n = 0/7], p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis shows 
a positive association between pain at the buttock and the decrease from rest of 
oxygen pressure (DROP) ≤ -15 mmHg at the level of the buttock with the presence 
of iliac lesions. Conclusion: On a routine basis, Ex-TcpO2 is a tool of interest 
to assess patients with claudication for doubtful arterial origin or walking 
distance, especially in proximal IC, and to predict favorable clinical outcomes 
after revascularization.

PURPOSE: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a pivotal tool for studying balance 
and postural control mechanisms, leveraging unpredictable visual disturbances 
that dynamically challenge visuomotor processing. However, the quantity and 
quality of information available in the visual field may differ between VR 
systems, potentially introducing conflict with the intended perturbation inputs. 
Consequently, the extent to which a VR system used in a visual perturbation 
paradigm influences its ability to elicit compensatory gait behaviors remains 
unclear. Here we investigate the impact of (1) VR display modality and (2) the 
direction of visual perturbations on spatiotemporal gait parameters and measures 
of stability in VR.
METHODS: Participants were tasked with maintaining steady-state walking on a 
self-paced treadmill while viewing a VR scene presented in either a 
rear-projection curved screen immersive room (IR) or a head-mounted display 
(HMD). During trials with augmented visual perturbations, pseudorandom 
oscillations were combined with forward walking speed either in the 
anterior-posterior (AP), or medio-lateral (ML) direction. Linear mixed-effects 
models were used to analyze the impact of VR display type and visual 
perturbations on spatiotemporal gait parameters, stability measures, and joint 
kinematics.
RESULTS: For self-paced walking in matched VR optic flow, we found that the HMD 
increased the variability of several parameters related to walking speed 
control, but did not significantly impact any gait parameter average values. 
Superimposing visual perturbations along the ML axis increased gait variability 
and decreased walking stability in both VR systems, but the perturbations had 
stronger effects if presented in the HMD.
CONCLUSION: Together, these findings suggest that portable light-weight HMD 
systems can provide affordable, reliable tools for studying and training balance 
control and locomotion.

Vision plays a fundamental role in the control of human locomotion, including 
walking gait. Given that side-dominance is associated with differences in motor 
control, the present study aimed to determine if patches obscuring half of the 
visual field affect left- and right-side dominant individuals' gait kinematics 
and accompanying leg muscle activation differently. Healthy right- (n = 15, 
age = 28.2 ± 5.5 years) and left-side (n = 9, age = 27.9 ± 5.8 years) dominant 
participants performed 10 min of walking trials on a treadmill at a 
self-selected speed with 5 min of rest between three randomized trials, i.e., 
wearing clear glasses or glasses with left-or right half-field eye patching. In 
addition to a set of spatiotemporal and kinematic gait parameters, the average 
activity during the separated gait cycle phases, and the start and end of muscle 
activation in % of the gait cycle were calculated from five muscles in three 
muscle groups. Our results indicate that gait kinematics of left- and right-side 
dominant participants were similar both in their dominant and non-dominant legs, 
regardless of half-field eye patching condition. On the other hand, inter-group 
differences were found in selected kinematic variables. For instance, in 
addition to larger but less variable step width, our results suggest larger 
ankle and knee ROM in right- vs. left-sided participants. Furthermore, medial 
gastrocnemius and biceps femoris muscle activation showed selected differences 
at certain phases of the gait cycle between participants' dominant and 
non-dominant legs. However, it was also unaffected by the half-field eye 
patching condition. Moreover, the endpoint of medial gastrocnemius activation 
was affected by side-dominance, i.e., its activation ended earlier in the 
non-dominant leg of right- as compared to left-side dominant participants. Our 
results suggest no major differences in walking gait kinematics and accompanying 
muscle activation between half-field eye patching conditions in healthy adults; 
nevertheless, side-dominance may affect biomechanical and neuromuscular control 
strategies during walking gait.

Walking instability increases the risk of falls and compromises mobility safety. 
This study aimed to explore the impact of various percentages of preferred 
walking speed (PWS)-specifically, 40%, 55%, 70%, 85%, 100%, 115%, 130%, and 
145%-along with age-related changes, on walking stability during treadmill 
walking. Kinematic marker data from all walking speed trials were pooled for 
analysis, involving a total of 26 participants (13 young adults aged 
24.7 ± 2.4 years and 13 older adults aged 60.8 ± 6.4 years). These pooled data 
were then decomposed into various movement components (i.e., movement 
strategies), known as principal movements (PMs), using principal component 
analysis (PCA). These PMs, which resemble the phases of a gait cycle, 
collectively contribute to the accomplishment of the walking task. The 
participant-specific largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) was employed to assess the 
local dynamic stability of individual PMs, with lower LyE values indicating 
higher stability, thereby allowing for the examination of walking speed and age 
effects. The main findings revealed that only the effects of altered walking 
speeds were observed; specifically, the LyE value for the midstance phase (PM3) 
at 100% of PWS was significantly lower than at 40% of PWS (p=0.001), and there 
was a trend indicating that the LyE value at 100% of PWS was also lower than at 
140% of PWS (p=0.027). These results suggest that PWS enhances the stability of 
the mid-stance-phase movement component of the gait cycle more than the slower 
and faster walking speeds during treadmill walking.

BACKGROUND: Gait variability is increased in people with bilateral 
vestibulopathy (BVP). Since dedicated gait analysis can be resource-intensive, 
concurrent assessment with another vestibular function test, dynamic visual 
acuity (DVA), is worth consideration.
OBJECTIVE: To assess comparability of results from a combined gait and DVA 
assessment with results from a previous dedicated gait analysis.
METHODS: 15 participants (4 women) with BVP were analysed. The DVA test assessed 
visual acuity during stance and during treadmill walking at 2, 4 and 6 km/h. An 
8-camera motion capture system measured spatiotemporal gait parameters (step 
length, step time, step width and double support time; means and coefficients of 
variation [CoV]). The walking speed effect was assessed by mixed-effects models, 
and results were visually compared to previous results.
RESULTS: Walking speed affected the means of step length, step time and double 
support time (p < .0001) but not step width (p = .373) and significantly 
affected the CoV of all parameters (p < .01). These values, as well as 
speed-related changes, were comparable between contexts.
CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent DVA and gait assessment seems promising as an assessment 
method in people with BVP. Test-retest reliability, clinically feasible motion 
capture solutions and sensitivity to change following interventions should be 
further investigated.

BackgroundPeople with Parkinson's disease (PD) typically exhibit a narrow-based 
gait. We previously found that walking with reduced trunk rotation and obliquity 
led to narrow-based gait in healthy adults; a decrease in trunk motion coincided 
with a decrease in mediolateral extrapolated center of mass (XCoM) excursion, 
requiring a smaller step width to maintain a constant mediolateral margin of 
stability (MoS).ObjectiveTo assess whether reduced trunk motion in PD is related 
to narrow-based gait, without affecting mediolateral MoS. To explore the 
underlying mechanisms of narrow-based gait, we examined the effects of 
increasing arm swing (aiming to increase trunk motion), and widening steps on 
gait in PD.MethodsFifteen people with PD and narrow-based gait and 17 
age-matched controls walked on a treadmill for three minutes at a fixed gait 
speed during three conditions: baseline, increased arm swing and widened step 
width. Step width, trunk rotation and obliquity were calculated using marker 
data, and XCoM excursion and MoS using ground reaction forces.ResultsTrunk 
rotation, XCoM excursion, and step width were significantly smaller in PD 
compared to controls, while the MoS did not differ. Increased arm swing did not 
substantially increase trunk motions in PD, though people with PD were able to 
widen their step width.ConclusionsWe provide further evidence for a relation 
between trunk motion and step width. In PD, reduced trunk motion may contribute 
to narrow-based gait, without affecting mediolateral MoS; future work is needed 
to confirm a causal relationship between reduced trunk motion and narrow-based 
gait in PD.

Plain Language Summary: People with Parkinson's disease (PD) typically walk with 
a smaller base of support compared to healthy adults. The underlying mechanisms 
are unclear. In an earlier study that we conducted among healthy adults, we 
found that walking with reduced trunk motion led to a narrow-based gait pattern, 
without affecting sideways stability. In this study, we tested whether reduced 
trunk motion is related to narrow-based gait in people with PD, while having no 
impact on sideways stability. To further explore the mechanisms underlying 
narrow-based gait, we examined the effects of walking with increased arm swing 
(to increase trunk motion), and widening steps on gait in PD. This study 
included 15 people with PD, and 17 age-matched controls who walked on a 
treadmill for three minutes at a fixed gait speed during three experimental 
conditions. The conditions included: walking with no additional instructions, 
walking with increased arm swing, and walking with increased step width. The 
study variables collected were step width, trunk rotation and obliquity (as 
measures for trunk motion), center of mass excursions and a measure for 
(dynamic) stability. We found that trunk rotation, center of mass excursions and 
step width were smaller in people with PD compared to controls while stability 
did not differ. Increased arm swing did not lead to increased trunk motion in 
PD. People with PD were able to widen their step width. We have provided further 
evidence for a relation between trunk motion and step width. In people with PD, 
reduced trunk motion may contribute to narrow-based gait, without affecting 
stability. Future studies should confirm the relationship between reduced trunk 
motion and narrow-based gait in PD.

BackgroundEndurance exercise improves aerobic capacity (VO2peak) and motor 
symptoms in people with early Parkinson's disease (PD). Some people with PD 
exhibit signs of chronotropic incompetence (CI), which may impact 
exercise-induced benefits.ObjectiveWe investigated whether CI in people with 
early PD influences the change in motor signs, VO2peak, and peak heart rate (HR) 
following 6 months of endurance exercise.MethodsWe performed secondary analyses 
of the Study in Parkinson's Disease of Exercise (SPARX), which randomized people 
with early PD into a high-intensity endurance exercise [80-85% of peak HR], 
moderate-intensity endurance exercise [60-65% of peak HR], or usual care group. 
MDS-UDPRS Part 3 score, VO2peak, and heart rate (HR) response to maximal 
cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) were analyzed at baseline and following 
6 months of exercise. Participants were divided into three groups: 1) normal 
chronotropic response at baseline, 2) CI at baseline, and 3) taking medications 
with a known negative chronotropic effect regardless of CI status.ResultsData 
from 119 individuals (64.0 ± 9.0 years, 57.1% male, 0.3 years since diagnosis 
[median]) were analyzed. There were no differences among the groups in change in 
MDS-UPDRS motor score (p = 0.953), VO2peak (p = 0.965), or peak HR (p = 0.388). 
People randomized into the high-intensity group improved VO2peak compared to 
usual care (p < 0.001adj) regardless of CI status.ConclusionsBaseline CI did not 
alter responses to endurance exercise in those with early PD, suggesting that 
the beneficial effects of endurance exercise on disease progression and VO2peak 
in people with early PD apply equally to people with CI.

Plain Language Summary: Exercise training, such as walking on a treadmill, helps 
improve fitness and symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) in those who have 
recently been diagnosed with PD. We aimed to determine if these beneficial 
effects of exercise were also experienced by those with PD who may have a hard 
time increasing their heart rate during an exercise test. This study looked at 
the effects of different intensities of 6 months of treadmill exercise and the 
ability to get one's heart rate up to where one might expect based on age during 
exercise testing on motor symptoms of PD and exercise capacity. Regardless of 
one's ability to increase their heart rate to an expected value based on age, 
individuals with early PD experienced benefits from 6 months of treadmill 
exercise training. This suggests that the beneficial effects of exercise 
training on disease progression and exercise capacity in early PD apply equally 
to those with normal or abnormal heart rate responses to exercise testing.

University, Shanghai, China.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the biomechanical 
characteristics of patients with stroke and neuromuscular action control 
mechanisms in single-dual-task walking-conversion training.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with stroke from four centers were enrolled and 
randomly divided into the cognitive combined treadmill-walking and exercise 
combined treadmill-walking groups (n = 30 per group). The gait spatiotemporal 
parameters, walking function, and fall risk of the two experimental groups were 
compared before and after 4 and 6 weeks of training. Surface electromyography 
(sEMG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) were performed to 
analyze neuromuscular action control mechanisms in different task phases.
RESULTS: After 6 weeks of training, the gait spatiotemporal parameters, walking 
function, integral electromyogram (iEMG) values, and root mean square (RMS) of 
the affected lower limb muscles of the two experimental groups significantly 
improved (P < 0.01), while the fall risk was reduced (P < 0.01). fNIRS analysis 
showed that in both the single- and dual-task phases, HbO signal concentrations 
in the brain functional regions of the two experimental groups significantly 
increased after training (P < 0.01). These indicators were not significantly 
different between the two experimental groups after 6 weeks of training 
(P > 0.05). In addition, during the dual-task phase, the blood oxygen signal 
concentrations and functional connectivity in the functional brain regions of 
the two experimental groups were lower than those of healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: Cognitive or motor tasks combined with treadmill-walking training 
can promote the recovery of physical function in patients with stroke.Clinical 
trial registration: This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial 
Registry (ChiCTR; registration number: ChiCTR2200060864).

Turning on cue or stopping at a red light requires attending to such cues to 
select action sequences, or suppress action, in accordance with learned 
cue-associated action rules. Cortico-striatal projections are an essential part 
of the brain's attention-motor interface. Glutamate-sensing microelectrode 
arrays were used to measure glutamate transients in the dorsomedial striatum 
(DMS) of male and female rats walking a treadmill and executing cued turns and 
stops. Prelimbic-DMS projections were chemogenetically inhibited to determine 
their behavioral necessity and the cortico-striatal origin of cue-evoked 
glutamate transients. Furthermore, we investigated rats exhibiting preferably 
goal-directed (goal trackers, GTs) versus cue-driven attention (sign-trackers, 
STs), to determine the impact of such cognitive-motivational biases on 
cortico-striatal control. GTs executed more cued turns and initiated such turns 
more slowly than STs. During turns, but not missed turns or cued stops, 
cue-evoked glutamate concentrations were higher in GTs than in STs. In STs, turn 
cue-locked glutamate concentrations frequently peaked twice or three times, 
contrasting with predominately single peaks in GTs. In GTs, but not STs, 
inhibition of prelimbic-DMS projections attenuated turn rates and turn 
cue-evoked glutamate concentrations and increased the number of turn cue-locked 
glutamate peaks. These findings indicate that turn cue-evoked glutamate release 
in GTs is tightly controlled by cortico-striatal neuronal activity. In contrast, 
in STs, glutamate release from DMS glutamatergic terminals may be regulated by 
other striatal circuitry, preferably mediating cued suppression of action and 
reward tracking. As cortico-striatal dysfunction has been hypothesized to 
contribute to a wide range of disorders, including complex movement control 
deficits in Parkinson's disease and compulsive drug taking, the demonstration of 
phenotypic contrasts in cortico-striatal control implies the presence of 
individual vulnerabilities for such disorders.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) significantly affects patient 
prognosis, leading to a rapid decline in physical function and health-related 
quality of life. PAD impacts walking economy, causing higher oxygen uptake 
during submaximal walking, which is crucial for evaluating walking performance 
and aerobic endurance.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How do arm-ergometry supervised exercise training (AEx) and 
treadmill exercise training (TEx) compare in their effects on walking economy, 
and what clinical characteristics and outcomes influence the degree of this 
improvement?
METHODS: This study is an ancillary investigation of the ARMEX trial, a 
single-center, single-blinded, parallel groups, noninferiority randomized 
clinical trial. Patients with symptomatic PAD were randomized (1:1 ratio) either 
to a 12-week AEx or TEx. Walking economy was measured by oxygen uptake (V̇O2) 
during submaximal effort during the treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise test 
(CPET).
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (66 ± 8.4 years; 87.5 % male) were enrolled and 
randomized: AEx (n = 28) and TEx (n = 28). At 12-weeks, V̇O2 at 60 until 240 s 
decreased only in TEx. Between-group differences were found at 60 until 240 s 
favoring TEx. Exercising in the TEx group and lower baseline body mass index 
(BMI) were independently associated with a greater improvement in walking 
economy. Changes in walking economy were inversely correlated with changes in 
V̇O2 peak and positively correlated with CPET maximum walking distance and 
self-reported walking distance.
SIGNIFICANCE: Treadmill exercise improved walking economy more than 
arm-ergometry in patients with PAD. Individuals with a higher BMI experience 
less improvement in walking economy with exercise training and might require 
specialized interventions.

Genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) increase vulnerability 
to cognitive and behavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Nf1 results from mutations in the 
neurofibromin gene that can reduce levels of the neurofibromin protein. While 
the mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated, loss of Nf1 may alter neuronal 
circuit activity leading to changes in behavior and susceptibility to cognitive 
and behavioral comorbidities. Here we show that mutations decreasing Nf1 
expression alter motor behaviors, impacting the patterning, prioritization, and 
behavioral state dependence in a Drosophila model of Nf1. Loss of Nf1 increased 
spontaneous grooming in male and female flies. This followed a nonlinear spatial 
pattern, with Nf1 deficiency increasing grooming of certain body parts 
differentially, including the abdomen, head, and wings. The increase in grooming 
could be overridden by hunger in foraging animals, demonstrating that the Nf1 
effect is plastic and internal state dependent. Stimulus-evoked grooming 
patterns were altered as well, suggesting that hierarchical recruitment of 
grooming command circuits was altered. Yet loss of Nf1 in sensory neurons and/or 
grooming command neurons did not alter grooming frequency, suggesting that Nf1 
affects grooming via higher-order circuit alterations. Changes in grooming 
coincided with alterations in walking. Flies lacking Nf1 walked with increased 
forward velocity on a spherical treadmill, yet there was no detectable change in 
leg kinematics or gait. These results demonstrate that loss of Nf1 alters the 
patterning and prioritization of repetitive behaviors, in a state-dependent 
manner, without affecting low-level motor functions.

When discrepancies between planned and actual movements arise due to 
environmental changes, humans adjust movement parameters to achieve task goals. 
While motor adaptation has been extensively studied, the mechanisms involved in 
redundant movement parameters remain unclear. Split-belt treadmill adaptation, 
where each belt moves at a different speed, is an example of this phenomenon. 
Such adaptation initially induces gait asymmetry, which diminishes over time. 
Previous studies have postulated step length asymmetry as the target function; 
however, recent evidence challenges this assumption, leaving the target function 
undefined. This study investigates the target function by analyzing step 
parameter asymmetry using the goal-equivalent manifold and generalization 
predictability. The goal-equivalent manifold assesses whether adaptation is 
close to optimal in minimizing step parameter asymmetry, while generalization 
predictability reflects adaptation effects across different contexts, indicating 
potential target functions. We propose that step velocity asymmetry, rather than 
step length asymmetry, serves as the target function in split-belt treadmill 
adaptation. This framework facilitates the prediction and interpretation of both 
the learning process and the transfer of learning effects from trained to 
untrained conditions. In addition, it explains the overadaptation of step length 
asymmetry and the achievement of energy-efficient gait after adaptation. 
Therefore, we propose that step velocity asymmetry is the primary target 
function in split-belt treadmill adaptation.

BACKGROUND: Walking on an incline demands specific neuronal control because the 
vestibular system may alter gait patterns to maintain balance with respect to 
self-orientation to gravity. A previous study confirms the aforementioned 
hypothesis that walking on inclines with bilateral vestibular disruptions 
altered spatial-temporal gait parameters in anterior-posterior and vertical 
directions. This study extended the current knowledge to investigate bilateral 
mastoid vibration's effect on the Margin of Stability (MoS) while walking on 
inclines.
METHODS: Eighteen healthy young adults participated in this study. Participants 
were randomly assigned to eight treadmill trials, encompassing walking at their 
preferred walking speed on inclines of 0%, 3%, 6%, and 9% with and without 
bilateral mastoid vibrations. The dependent variables were MoS in both the 
anterior-posterior (MoSap) and medial-lateral (MoSml) directions, the 
variability of MoS in both AP (MoSVap) and ML (MoSVml) directions, step length, 
step length variability, step width, and step width variability.
RESULTS: We found the significantly greater MoSap (3%: p = 0.005, 6%: p = 0.002, 
9%: p < 0.001) and the significantly larger step length (3%: p = 0.008, 6%: 
p = 0.025, 9%: p < 0.001) while walking on different inclines with bilateral 
mastoid vibration than without vestibular stimulation. We also noticed MoSml 
(F1, 17 = 14.24, p = 0.002) was significantly smaller while walking with 
bilateral mastoid vibration than walking without vestibular stimulation.
DISCUSSION: These results revealed that bilateral mastoid vibrations impact the 
margin of stability in both directions, and walking on inclines requires 
adjustment of MoS. This result may facilitate future clinical implications for 
patients with compromised vestibular functions.

Balance impairment after a stroke is a common impediment to activities of daily 
living and can lead to falls. Balance ability is particularly associated with 
social participation; therefore, targeted rehabilitation to prevent falls is 
crucial. We have previously developed a dual-belt treadmill task for repetitive 
multidirectional stepping based on open-skill training, which demonstrated 
significant efficacy in balance training for older adults. However, the effect 
on stroke survivors, who are more likely to move in a manner that compensates 
for their non-paretic limbs, remains unclear. This report presents the specific 
application of the dual-belt treadmill task in a chronic stroke survivor who 
experienced falls outdoors. The participant was a woman in her 60s with left 
hemiplegia, two years post-stroke, who walked independently. She attended a day 
rehabilitation program twice a week, receiving 40-minute sessions of exercise 
therapy. However, after experiencing two falls, a dual-belt treadmill 
intervention was introduced. This report examines the changes in physical 
function and fall-related outcomes over two three-month periods before and after 
the introduction of the dual-belt treadmill, using an AB design. Following the 
dual-belt treadmill intervention, a reduction in the number of falls was 
observed, along with increased muscle strength in the affected limb. The 
dual-belt treadmill intervention may be effective in reducing falls in chronic 
stroke patients.

AIMS: Intermittent claudication is a major barrier to establishing an exercise 
routine in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). This study 
investigated the preconditioning effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation 
(NMES) on walking capacity in patients with PAD and intermittent claudication. 
Additionally, it aimed to determine the optimal NMES settings and the underlying 
mechanisms of its effects.
METHODS: A total of 15 patients with PAD (Fontaine II) participated in a 
crossover study. Each patient underwent 10-min sessions of NMES at two 
frequencies (4 and 20 Hz) and two intensities (moderate and high), plus a sham 
condition, before treadmill walking tests using the modified Gardner protocol.
RESULTS: Pain-free walking distance significantly increased after a single 
session of 20 Hz high-intensity NMES (259.2±27.5 m; p＜0.05) relative to the sham 
group (201.9±23.6 m). The maximum walking distance also improved significantly 
after 4 and 20 Hz high-intensity NMES. The vascular endothelial function, 
assessed by flow-mediated dilation, was significantly enhanced following 20 Hz 
moderate- and high-intensity NMES, as well as 4 Hz high-intensity NMES, relative 
to the sham group. Additionally, lower extremity blood flow, as measured via 
transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen, improved significantly in all NMES 
conditions. However, serum markers such as myeloperoxidase, hepatocyte growth 
factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and CD34＋/CD133＋ progenitor cell 
counts did not differ significantly between the NMES and sham groups.
CONCLUSION: High-intensity 20 Hz NMES is an effective preconditioning strategy 
for instantaneously enhancing the walking capacity in patients with PAD, likely 
due to nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation. These findings suggest that NMES is a 
promising therapeutic approach for PAD rehabilitation.

Preferred running speed is a relevant condition for measuring spatio-temporal 
parameters and their variability as it theoretically corresponds to an intensity 
where the energy cost, the biomechanical constraints and the pleasure are 
optimal. The objective of this study was to evaluate 1) the between-days 
reliability of spatio-temporal parameters measurements at preferred running 
speed and 2) the minimal number of steps required to obtain a representative 
measurement. Thirty-one recreational runners (age: 26 ± 5.5 years; running 
experience > 2 years) performed three sessions of treadmill running at preferred 
running speed separated by 24 h. Spatio-temporal parameters were stride, step, 
contact and flight times, cadence, step length, duty factor, vertical and leg 
stiffness. Mean, linear and non-linear measurements of spatio-temporal 
parameters were computed. Reliability was determined using intraclass 
coefficient correlation and his 95 % confidence interval lower band (95 %LB). 
Number of steps required for intra-session representativity were defined as the 
first number of steps from which all measurements are equal to the measurement 
at the longer time series length. For all spatio-temporal parameters, mean data 
showed excellent reliability (95 %LB > 0.90) but most spatio-temporal parameters 
linear and non-linear variability measurements showed questionable reliability 
(95 %LB < 0.79). The absolute speed variation at preferred running speed 
(minimal detectable change 0.8 km/h) may explain these results. Representative 
values required between 16 and 352 steps for mean value of spatio-temporal 
parameters, between 16 and 400 steps for linear measurements, and between 336 
and 704 steps for non-linear measurements.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative rehabilitation following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) 
varies worldwide. In Finland, patients receive guidance on safe walking and home 
exercises from a physiotherapist both before and after TKA. These are performed 
independently after surgery. However, a sedentary lifestyle is rather common 
among patients who have undergone TKA, with pain often limiting postoperative 
walking, training, and activities of daily living.
OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the 
effectiveness of anti-gravity exercise, precisely the AlterG anti-gravity 
treadmill, on postoperative rehabilitation following TKA and to obtain new 
knowledge on this form of rehabilitation to better use it in the future.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial study divided the patients into two 
groups: the intervention group and the control group. The follow-up period was 
12 months. Research data were collected through questionnaires and functional 
tests. All patients in both groups responded to the questionnaires and 
participated in functional tests before surgery as well as 4 and 12 months after 
surgery. Patients in the intervention group exercised on the AlterG treadmill 10 
times after the surgery. All the patients in this study performed the exercises 
as instructed when they were in the hospital. The primary outcomes were 
perceived pain, walking ability, and quality of life.
RESULTS: The data collection process began in 2018 and concluded in 2022, 
intending to obtain valuable information regarding the effect of AlterG training 
after TKA and determine whether it, along with traditional exercises, could be 
an effective form of rehabilitation that can be performed at home. We 
hypothesized that AlterG training would lead to faster rehabilitation, better 
walking quality, improved quality of life, improved physical activity, and 
improved overall functioning. The results of this study will be analyzed in 2025 
and 2026.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides information on how AlterG training can be used 
in rehabilitation after TKA, further enhancing the rehabilitation program for 
patients undergoing TKA in general.

BACKGROUND: Smartwatches are increasingly used to monitor and motivate physical 
activity. Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and peripheral artery 
disease (PAD) often do not meet national physical activity recommendations. They 
may, thus, benefit from a physical activity program using smartwatches. The Life 
Plus smartwatch is designed to facilitate activity monitoring by counting steps, 
but its validity needs to be determined, particularly in patients who may not 
have a normal gait, such as those with cardiovascular pathology.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the accuracy of the Life Plus smartwatch 
(versions 2 and 3) in healthy adults, patients with CVD, and patients with PAD 
at different walking speeds (1.8, 2.5, 3.2, and 4 km/h) and different 
localizations (wrists, hips, and ankles) to determine best accuracy.
METHODS: In total, 34 participants, comprising healthy individuals (n=10), 
patients with CVD (n=14), and patients with PAD (n=10), wore 6 Life Plus watches 
simultaneously (3 of version 2 and 3 of version 3), located on wrists, hips, and 
ankles. Participants walked on a treadmill for 3-minute sessions at speeds of 
1.8, 2.5, 3.2, and 4 km/h; they then performed a 10-minute free walking on the 
ground and again walked for 3-minute sessions on a treadmill at the same speeds. 
Actual step counts were recorded through video footage.
RESULTS: When worn at the wrist, no significant difference between the actual 
number of steps and step count by version 2 watches was found in each group 
independently (healthy group: P=.25; CVD group: P=.50; and PAD group: P=.37). 
Significant differences were found with the version 2 watches at the wrist in 
the healthy group at 3.2 (-5.26%; P=.01) and 4 km/h (-6.13%; P=.008) and in the 
CVD group at 2.5 (-5.94%; P=.008), 3.2(-13.1%; P=.008), and 4 km/h (-13.96%; 
P=.004). When worn at the wrist, no significant difference between actual number 
of steps and step count by version 3 watches was found in the healthy group 
(P=.02) and the PAD group (P=.90). Significant differences were found with the 
version 3 watches at the wrist in the CVD group at 3.2 (-6.43%; P=.001) and 4 
km/h (-7.3%; P=.01) and in the PAD group at 4 km/h (-5.77%; P=.04).
CONCLUSIONS: For optimized counting when worn at the wrist, healthy individuals 
should prefer version 2 watches for slow walking (1.8 and 2.5 km/h) and version 
3 for higher speeds (3.2 and 4 km/h). Patients (CVD and PAD) should prefer 
version 2 watches at 1.8 km/h and version 3 watches for higher speeds (2.5, 3.2, 
and 4 km/h).

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) remains underdiagnosed and undertreated and is 
associated with an increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Imaging 
provides an approach to identifying patients with PAD. However, the role of 
integrating imaging with machine learning to identify PAD patients and 
potentially assess disease severity remains understudied. A total of 56 
participants, including 36 PAD patients with intermittent claudication and 20 
matched controls, underwent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging 
(CE-MRI) calf muscle perfusion scanning. CE-MRI-derived dynamic muscle perfusion 
maps were developed to quantify alterations of the microvascular circulation in 
the calf muscles based on voxel contrast enhancement. These dynamic muscle 
perfusion maps categorized voxels as hyper-, iso-, or hypo-enhanced and were 
generated for the anterior (AM), lateral (LM), and deep posterior (DM) muscle 
groups, and the soleus (SM) and gastrocnemius muscles (GM). An unsupervised 
block-search algorithm was developed to identify heterogeneous regions of 
interest based on homogeneity. Machine learning methods were utilized to 
classify PAD patients from controls, with subgroup analyses performed based on 
lower extremity function and diabetes. The hypo-enhanced and hyper-enhanced 
voxel percentages obtained from the dynamic muscle perfusion maps were used to 
train a decision tree classifier to distinguish PAD patients from controls. The 
two-group classifier obtained a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) F1-score 
of 87.6 and 76.7% with hyper-enhanced and hypo-enhanced perfusion features 
averaged over all muscle groups, respectively. Hypo-enhanced perfusion features, 
a marker of microvascular perfusion abnormalities, classified PAD patients who 
completed a 6-minute treadmill walking test compared to those who did not, with 
an LOOCV F1-score of 67.6%. Using the same method, hypo-enhanced perfusion 
features differentiated PAD patients with diabetes versus those without with an 
LOOCV F1-score of 70.3%. In conclusion, CE-MRI derived measures of skeletal calf 
muscle perfusion can be used with a decision tree classifier to differentiate 
PAD patients from matched controls. Machine learning can also identify PAD 
patients with lower exercise capacity and those with concomitant diabetes. 
Machine learning and CE-MRI derived measures of the calf microcirculation could 
be of interest in the study of PAD and disease severity.

PURPOSE: Occupational heat strain can impair construction workers' motor and 
cognitive functions, potentially leading to accidents, injuries and lowered 
productivity. We examined the effects of physical work under various warm and 
humid tropical conditions on performance in virtual reality (VR)-based 
construction tasks.
METHODS: Eighteen healthy men (age: 29 ± 5 years) completed three randomised, 
counterbalanced experimental trials comprising ~2.5 h of exposure to wet-bulb 
globe temperatures of 24.6 ± 0.2 °C (COOL), 28.1 ± 0.3 °C (WARM) and 32.4 ± 0.3 
°C (HOT), representing Singapore's current (COOL and WARM) and projected (HOT) 
conditions. Participants performed three 30-min bouts of treadmill walking at 
fixed metabolic heat productions representing light (EX1: 250 W), moderate (EX2: 
350 W) and heavy (EX3: 450 W) workloads, each separated by completion of a 
battery of VR-based construction tasks (welding and plank-walking at height). 
Task speed and accuracy, postural sway and gait were recorded during the VR 
tasks, while body core (Tc) and mean skin temperatures (Tsk), and heart rate 
(HR) were recorded continuously.
RESULTS: Post-trial Tc was higher in HOT (38.6 ± 0.4 °C) compared with WARM 
(38.1 ± 0.3 °C; P < 0.001) and COOL (37.9 ± 0.3 °C; P < 0.001), while mean Tsk 
(P < 0.001) and HR (P < 0.001) differed between all conditions (HOT>WARM>COOL). 
Task speed and accuracy during welding and plank-walking were similar between 
conditions (all P > 0.05). However, postural sway velocity during welding 
increased (by 2.08 ± 2.5 mm.s-1; P < 0.05) from baseline to post-trial in HOT 
but not in WARM or COOL (both P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Although task performance was maintained across environments, 
postural balance during an attention-demanding task (welding) was impaired 
following physical work in Singapore's projected environmental conditions, which 
could increase the risk of potentially fatal accidents and injuries (e.g., 
falling from height). Effective workplace interventions are needed to protect 
workers' health, safety and productivity against future warming.

BACKGROUND: Major surgery is associated with significant morbidity and a reduced 
quality of life, particularly among older adults and individuals with frailty 
and impaired functional capacity. Multimodal prehabilitation can enhance 
functional recovery after surgery and reduce postoperative complications. 
Digital prehabilitation has the potential to be a resource-sparing and 
patient-empowering tool that improves patients' preoperative status; however, 
little remains known regarding their safety and accuracy as medical devices.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the accuracy and validity of a new software 
in comparison to the gold-standard electrocardiogram (ECG)-based heart rate 
measurement.
METHODS: The PROTEGO MAXIMA trial was a prospective interventional pilot trial 
assessing the validity, accuracy, and safety of an app-based exercise program. 
The Prehab App calculates a personalized, risk-stratified aerobic interval 
training plan based on individual risk factors and utilizes wearables to monitor 
heart rate. Healthy students and patients undergoing major surgery were 
enrolled. A structured risk assessment was conducted, followed by a 6-minute 
walking test and a 37-minute supervised interval session. During the exercise, 
patients wore app-linked wearables for heart rate and distance measurements, 
which were compared with standard ECG and treadmill measurements. Safety, 
accuracy, and usability assessments included testing alarm signals, while the 
occurrence of adverse events served as the primary and secondary outcome 
measures.
RESULTS: A total of 75 participants were included. The mean heart rate 
differences between wearables and standard ECG were ≤5 bpm (beats per minute) 
with a mean absolute percentage error of ≤5%. Regression analysis revealed a 
significant impact of the BMI (odds ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.98, P=.02) and 
Timed Up and Go Test score (odds ratio 0.12, 95% CI 0.03-0.55, P=.006) on the 
accuracy of heart rate measurement; 29 (39%) patients experienced adverse 
events: pain (5/12, 42%), ECG electrode-related skin irritations (2/42, 17%), 
dizziness (2/42, 17%), shortness of breath (2/42, 17%), and fatigue (1/42, 8%). 
No cardiovascular or serious adverse events were reported, and no serious device 
deficiency was detected. There were no indications of clinically meaningful 
overexertion based on laboratory values measured before and after the 6-minute 
walking test and exercise. The differences in means and ranges were as follows: 
lactate (mmol/l), mean 0.04 (range -3 to 6; P=.47); creatinine kinase (U/l), 
mean 12 (range -7 to 43; P<.001); and sodium (mmol/l), mean -2 (range -11 to 12; 
P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The interventional trial demonstrated the high safety of the 
exercise program and the accuracy of heart rate measurements using commercial 
wearables in patients before major surgery, paving the way for potential remote 
implementation in the future.

ObjectiveTo understand in people with stroke: (1) reasons for cardiopulmonary 
treadmill exercise test termination, (2) how frequently secondary criteria 
indicating a maximal test are met, and (3) how test termination is related to 
volume of oxygen consumption and participant characteristics.DesignA secondary 
analysis from the Promoting Recovery Optimization of Walking Activity in Stroke 
(NCT02835313) clinical trial.SettingFour outpatient rehabilitation 
clinics.ParticipantsPeople with chronic stroke able to walk without assistance 
of another person.InterventionParticipants (n = 250) randomized in a larger 
clinical trial completed symptom limited graded exercise treadmill tests pre- 
(n = 247) and post-intervention (n = 185). Treadmill exercise tests were 
conducted at constant speed with incremental incline increases.Main MeasuresThe 
primary measure was reason for cardiopulmonary exercise test termination. 
Secondary measures included: oxygen consumption, ventilatory threshold, peak 
heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, six-minute walk test, and fastest 
walking speed.ResultsThere were six categories of test termination, 
electrocardiogram (11%), blood pressure/heart rate (13%), biomechanical (25%), 
self-selected (41%), equipment malfunction (8%), and other (2%). Only 1.9% of 
tests achieved the threshold to confirm a maximal aerobic effort. There were no 
differences in peak volume of oxygen consumption or participant characteristics 
between test termination categories.ConclusionsAnalyses indicate few with 
chronic stroke exhibit a maximal aerobic effort on a cardiopulmonary exercise 
test. If the cardiorespiratory system is not thoroughly taxed during treadmill 
exercise tests in people with chronic stroke, interpreting results as their 
cardiorespiratory fitness should be done cautiously.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) negatively affects walking 
performance, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental health. Exercise 
training is recommended as a first-line treatment for PAD, with potential impact 
on all these outcomes, but the optimal program design is not completely 
ascertained. The aim of this study was to compare arm-ergometry (AEx) and 
treadmill supervised exercise training (TEx) on HRQoL and mental health in 
patients with PAD.
METHODS: This was an ancillary study of the ARMEX trial, a single-center, 
single-blinded, parallel group, randomized clinical trial, enrolling symptomatic 
PAD patients referred to a cardiovascular rehabilitation program (CRP). 
Participants were randomized (1:1) to a 12-week AEx or TEx, along with the core 
components of a CRP (nutritional and psychological support). Participants 
completed the short form 36 Health Survey and the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression scale before and after the intervention. Differences between groups 
in the change from baseline to the end of the study were analyzed using ANCOVA, 
adjusted for baseline values, or the Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (66 ± 8.4 years; 87.5% male) were included: AEx 
(n = 28) and TEx (n = 28). Physical functioning, role-physical, bodily-pain, 
general health, mental health and physical component summary (PCS) significantly 
improved in AEx group. In the TEx group, physical functioning, role-physical, 
bodily-pain, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and PCS significantly 
improved. Role-physical and role-emotional improved more in TEx, with no 
between-group differences in the other domains. Changes in PCS were 
significantly associated with changes in walking distances. Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression scale scores improved in both groups, without between-group 
differences. This improvement was associated with self-reported walking 
distance.
CONCLUSION: Both exercise protocols improved HRQoL and mental health in patients 
with symptomatic PAD, highlighting exercise-based programs as important 
treatment strategies for this population.

The fitness movement in the United States has evolved substantially since its 
emergence in the late 20th century, with social media platforms like YouTube and 
TikTok now playing a pivotal role in disseminating fitness programs and 
associated claims. One program that has gained considerable popularity is the 
12-3-30 treadmill workout (12-3-30), which involves walking at a 12% grade at 3 
mph for 30 minutes. Despite widespread claims about its effectiveness in burning 
fat and calories, there is a lack of peer-reviewed scientific studies evaluating 
these claims. The present study investigated metabolic responses to 12-3-30 
compared to self-paced treadmill running, with both sessions matched for total 
energy expenditure. Sixteen participants (7 female, 9 male) completed both 
sessions in a controlled laboratory setting, where metabolic data were collected 
using a metabolic analyzer. The measures recorded were completion time, total 
energy expenditure, energy expenditure rate, and substrate utilization 
(percentage of carbohydrate [%CHO] and fat [%FAT]). The results showed that, 
when matched for total energy expenditure, 12-3-30 had a significantly longer 
completion time, lower energy expenditure rate, higher %FAT, and lower %CHO than 
self-paced running. While 12-3-30 may be less time efficient than self-paced 
running for expending energy, it may be more advantageous for individuals aiming 
to increase fat utilization. The present study enhances our understanding of the 
metabolic demands associated with a trending fitness program and highlights the 
importance of scientifically evaluating such programs to provide evidence-based 
recommendations.

The split-belt treadmill task is an effective tool for studying walking 
adaptation, particularly the symmetry adaptation of spatiotemporal parameters 
such as step length and double support time. This study aimed to evaluate the 
relationship between symmetry adaptation of spatiotemporal parameters and 
dynamic stability during the double-support phase in split-belt walking. We 
hypothesized that restraining fast-side knee extension, which is necessary for 
step lengthening during adaptation, would decrease dynamic stability during the 
double-support phase. Ten able-bodied male participants performed split-belt 
walking tasks under three conditions: control, fast-side knee restraint, and 
slow-side knee restraint. Our findings revealed that slow-side knee restraint 
disrupted symmetry in double support time and significantly decreased stability 
on the fast side during the early and late adaptation phases. Contrary to our 
hypothesis, fast-side knee restraint did not have a statistically significant 
effect on dynamic stability or symmetry. These results suggest that decreased 
dynamic stability during the double-support phase, particularly due to 
limitations in the movement of the trailing leg, may hinder the adaptation 
process. This study highlights the importance of dynamic stability control 
during the double-support phase for successful walking adaptation. Future 
studies with larger sample sizes and varying speed conditions are recommended to 
generalize these findings and develop targeted interventions to improve walking 
adaptability and dynamic stability.

AIM: Existing literature suggests that exposure to colored environments can 
influence psychological, physiological, and behavioral responses. This study 
examined the effects of experiencing a self-selected enjoyable colored 
environment, compared to a neutral one, on psychological and physiological 
responses, as well as preferred walking speed during a 20-min treadmill walk.
METHODS: Eighty participants (40 females) were randomly assigned to either an 
experimental group (preferred colored environment) or a control group (neutral 
gray environment). Data were collected at five regular intervals during the 
treadmill walk.
RESULTS: Participants walked significantly slower in the colored environment 
compared to the neutral one, with this effect more pronounced in females, who 
significantly reduced their walking speed, while males remained unaffected. The 
walking task generally decreased depression and confusion levels; females showed 
a stronger reduction in depression, while males exhibited no significant change. 
During the task, females revealed significantly higher levels of perceived 
exertion and heart rate compared to males. A dynamic pattern emerged over time, 
with increases in perceived exertion, arousal, heart rate, and walking speed, 
while pleasure levels remained stable.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that females are more 
responsive-psychologically, physiologically, and behaviorally-to both the 
preferred colored environment and the walking task, demonstrating a greater 
tendency to derive wellbeing benefits from subtle stimuli. Furthermore, the 
observed dynamic pattern suggests the view that self-paced walking is 
intrinsically governed by a pleasure-driven dynamic. These insights offer 
valuable implications for designing tailored interventions and strategies to 
promote physical activity through walking. Future research should further 
explore the role of color preference perception and self-paced walking in 
enhancing wellbeing, particularly within exercise and rehabilitation contexts.

BACKGROUND: We sought to examine a potential neural mechanism of reduced 
depressive symptoms in response to aerobic treadmill walking exercise training 
in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). This includes a secondary analysis of 
depressive symptom and MRI data from an original randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) on exercise effects on learning and memory impairment in people with MS.
METHODS: Ten fully ambulatory people with MS were randomly assigned into either 
a 12-week aerobic treadmill walking condition or active control condition (ie, 
stretching and range-of-motion activities). All participants completed the 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for measurement of depressive symptoms as 
well as a resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) before and after the 12-week study 
period.
RESULTS: There were no between-condition differences in depressive symptoms at 
baseline. Participants who were randomly assigned to the intervention condition 
demonstrated reductions in depressive symptoms compared with minimal changes for 
those who underwent the control condition. This corresponded with significant 
changes in resting-state functional connectivity within the default-mode network 
(DMN).
CONCLUSIONS: The overall pattern of results suggests that resting-state 
functional connectivity within the DMN may represent a potential neural 
mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of exercise on depressive symptoms 
in people with MS. Such results warrant future consideration in the design and 
conduct of future RCTs that aim to treat MS-related depression with aerobic 
exercise training in people with MS who have been prescreened for clinical 
depression.

[Purpose] Treadmill-based interventions are widely utilized in rehabilitation 
due to their advantages of providing controlled environments and enabling 
individualized training. However, the differences between overground and 
treadmill walking during the subacute rehabilitation phase remain incompletely 
understood. This study aimed to compare gait parameters between treadmill 
walking at varying speeds and overground walking in a subacute rehabilitation 
setting. [Participants and Methods] A total of 42 inpatients with 
cerebrovascular and orthopedic conditions were recruited from a convalescent 
rehabilitation ward. Gait parameters were measured using the Gait Real-time 
Analysis Interactive Lab (GRAIL) system during comfortable overground walking 
and treadmill walking at various speeds, including self-selected comfortable 
speeds and speeds matched to overground walking. Walking speed, stride length, 
cadence, and step width were calculated without markers and compared across 
conditions. [Results] The comfortable treadmill walking speed was significantly 
lower than the overground walking speed (mean [standard deviation]: 0.85 [0.23] 
m/s vs. 1.20 [0.20] m/s). Stride length was significantly shorter during 
treadmill walking at comfortable speeds compared to overground walking (0.86 
[0.22] m vs. 1.21 [0.18] m), whereas step width was significantly wider (0.17 
[0.04] m vs. 0.13 [0.03] m). [Conclusion] Maintaining cadence at reduced 
treadmill speeds promotes comfortable endurance training in subacute 
rehabilitation patients.

In this study, we designed a wearable multi-sensor walking boot to measure foot 
angular momentum and introduced a novel method to quantify forefoot rocker 
motion as a function of walking speed. A treadmill walking experiment was 
conducted with eight healthy subjects wearing the multi-sensor walking boot. 
Using the collected data, we calculated foot angular momentum and the average 
rate of change in angular momentum during the double support phase. In addition, 
we used linear regression analysis to quantify foot rotation patterns across 
increasing walking speeds, assessing the potential of this method as a walking 
indicator. The results demonstrated that the foot rotation pattern in the 
healthy group was characterized by a gradual scaling of angular momentum and its 
average rate of change, with strong correlations to walking speed. Based on 
these findings, we conclude that the proposed method for quantifying forefoot 
rocker motion relative to walking speed can serve as an effective indicator of 
normal walking.

INTRODUCTION: Although research supports selecting steeper routes to minimize 
metabolic rate (Ṁ) in mountain racers, the ""steeper is cheaper"" strategy has yet 
to be confirmed for slower, more typical graded walking speeds under cold 
stress.
PURPOSE: Confirm whether ""steeper is cheaper"" is true for typical graded walking 
speeds in individuals exposed to incremental cold stress.
METHODS: Fourteen healthy, military-age adults (age, 24 ± 6 years; height, 1.72 
± 0.08 m; body mass, 72 ± 16 kg) completed four 20-min treadmill walks in three 
ambient temperatures (20, 10, and 0 °C) in light clothing (i.e., shorts, 
t-shirt, light gloves). Each walk involved five stages at incremental vertical 
speeds (0.00, 1.93, 3.86, 5.79, 7.79 m·min-1) but variable treadmill speeds 
(0.54, 0.72, 1.07 m·s-1). To verify the ""steeper is cheaper"" strategy, we 
compared Ṁ between treadmill speeds at matched vertical speeds in each 
temperature. We also tested if the 90% confidence interval around the mean 
percent paired difference between Load Carriage Decision Aid (LCDA) metabolic 
model predictions and measured Ṁ was within ±10%.
RESULTS: Ṁ was significantly higher for the faster treadmill speed at matched 
vertical speeds in all but two comparisons at 20 °C, all but two comparisons at 
10 °C, and all comparisons at 0 °C (p < 0.05). LCDA metabolic model predictions 
were statistically equivalent to measured Ṁ during graded walking at 20 °C (90% 
CI, -3.1, 0.6%) and 10 °C (-7.8, -2.6%) but not 0 °C (-16.2, -9.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Route planners should recommend steeper but shorter routes to 
minimize Ṁ in individuals that walk in temperate-to-cold environments. The LCDA 
metabolic model provides accurate Ṁ predictions in lightly dressed individuals 
in temperatures down to 10 °C, but users should expect underestimated Ṁ in 0 °C 
or colder.

BACKGROUND: Investigating the kinematics of copers, who are individuals with no 
recurrent ankle sprains, is necessary to prevent the development of chronic 
ankle instability (CAI). Since the ""giving way"" of the ankle joint (episodes of 
excessive inversion of the rearfoot, which do not result in an acute lateral 
ankle sprain) usually occurs during walking, investigating the intra-foot 
coordination during walking is necessary. This study aims to identify intra-foot 
coordination and its variability in copers while walking.
METHODS: The study included 12 copers, 13 CAIs, and 10 controls. The 
participants were required to walk on a treadmill at a fixed speed of 1.3 m/s. 
Using the modified vector coding technique, the coupling angle between the 
intra-foot joints, representing inter-joint coordination, was calculated and 
categorized into four coordination patterns. The coupling angle standard 
deviation represented the coordination variability during the stance phase.
RESULTS: The coordination between the rearfoot and midfoot in the frontal plane 
showed a significantly lower proportion of anti-phase with proximal dominance in 
the coper group than in the CAI and control groups during mid-stance (p < .05). 
Regarding coordination between the midfoot and forefoot in the sagittal plane, 
the coper group also showed a significantly lower proportion of in-phase 
coordination with distal dominancy than the CAI group during mid-stance (p < 
.05). For coordination between the midfoot and forefoot in the frontal plane, 
the coper group also showed a significantly lower proportion of anti-phase with 
distal dominance than the CAI group during the late stance (p < .05).The 
coordination variability between the sagittal midfoot and forefoot in the coper 
group was significantly lower than that in the CAI group and similar to that in 
the control group during mid-stance (p < .050).
CONCLUSIONS: These differences may explain why copers do not experience ankle 
sprain recurrence.

BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of symptoms and reduced exercise capacity from 
peripheral artery disease (PAD) remains unclear. Additionally, there is limited 
information on blood flow and skeletal muscle energetics after walking exercise 
in patients with claudication in comparison to healthy individuals.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 19 patients with claudication from PAD and 12 
healthy subjects. All participants underwent rest and post-exercise perfusion 
imaging of the lower leg muscles via PET/CT. Participants exercised on a 
treadmill following the Gardner-Skinner protocol. Skeletal muscle blood flow 
(SMBF) was quantified in each leg at rest and immediately after exercise. 
Phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery and NAD+/NADH concentrations were measured pre- 
and post-exercise by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in a subset of 
participants. Comparisons were made between the legs of healthy subjects and the 
asymptomatic and symptomatic legs of patients with PAD.
RESULTS: SMBF increased post-exercise in all participants. Among patients with 
PAD, the post-exercise/rest SMBF ratio, was higher in the symptomatic (n = 25) 
than asymptomatic (n = 13) legs (8.03 ± 2.84 vs 6.03 ± 2.81, P = 0.046) and 
higher than the post-exercise/rest SMBF ratio measured in the legs of healthy 
subjects (4.40 ± 1.47, P < 0.001). The post-exercise/rest PCr and NAD+/NADH 
ratios were lower in the legs of patients with PAD (n = 3) when compared with 
the legs of healthy subjects (n = 6) (0.79 ± 0.06 vs 1.00 ± 0.07 (P = 0.004) and 
1.15 ± 0.43 vs 2.08 ± 0.30 (P = 0.007), respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: SMBF increased post-exercise to the greatest degree in the 
symptomatic legs of patients with PAD and post-exercise skeletal muscle 
mitochondrial function was abnormal in patients with PAD. These data suggest 
that the causes of symptoms and reduced exercise capacity from PAD are not 
limited to abnormal perfusion pressure in the legs.

BACKGROUND: Although transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) has been 
suggested as a safe and feasible intervention for gait rehabilitation, no 
studies have determined its effectiveness compared to sham stimulation.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of tSCS combined with robotic-assisted 
gait training (RAGT) on lower limb muscle strength and walking function in 
incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) participants.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial was 
conducted. Twenty-seven subacute iSCI participants were randomly allocated to 
tSCS or sham-tSCS group. All subjects conducted a standard Lokomat walking 
training program of 40 sessions (5 familiarization sessions, followed by 20 
sessions combined with active or sham tSCS, and finally the last 15 sessions 
with standard Lokomat). Primary outcomes were the lower extremity motor score 
(LEMS) and dynamometry. Secondary outcomes included the 10-Meter Walk Test 
(10MWT), the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), the 6-Minute Walk test (6MWT), the 
Spinal Cord Independence Measure III (SCIM III) and the Walking Index for Spinal 
Cord Injury II (WISCI-II). Motor evoked potential (MEP) induced by transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (TMS) were also assessed for lower limb muscles. 
Assessments were performed before and after tSCS intervention and after 3-weeks 
follow-up.
RESULTS: Although no significant differences between groups were detected after 
the intervention, the tSCS group showed greater effects than the sham-tSCS group 
for LEMS (3.4 points; p = 0.033), 10MWT (37.5 s; p = 0.030), TUG (47.7 s; 
p = 0.009), and WISCI-II (3.4 points; p = 0.023) at the 1-month follow-up 
compared to baseline. Furthermore, the percentage of subjects who were able to 
walk 10 m at the follow-up was greater in the tSCS group (85.7%) compared to the 
sham group (43.1%; p = 0.029). Finally, a significant difference (p = 0.049) was 
observed in the comparison of the effects in the amplitude of the rectus femoris 
MEPs of tSCS group (- 0.97 mV) and the sham group (- 3.39 mV) at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this study suggest that the combination of standard 
Lokomat training with tSCS for 20 sessions was effective for LEMS and gait 
recovery in subacute iSCI participants after 1 month of follow-up. Trial 
registration ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05210166).

BACKGROUND: Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have an injury to the central 
nervous system around the time of birth that affects the development of the 
brain and spinal cord. This injury leads to changes in gait neuromechanics, 
including muscle activity and joint kinematics. Transcutaneous spinal cord 
stimulation (tSCS) is a novel neuromodulation technique that may improve 
movement and coordination in children with CP when paired with targeted physical 
therapy.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How does the combination of tSCS and short-burst interval 
locomotor treadmill training (SBLTT) affect individual gait neuromechanics in 
children with CP?
METHODS: Four children with CP (4-13 years old), received 24 sessions each of 
SBLTT only and SBLTT with tSCS (tSCS+SBLTT). Clinical assessments of spasticity 
and passive range of motion (PROM), as well as biomechanical assessments of 
joint kinematics, musculotendon lengths, and muscle activity were recorded 
during overground, barefoot walking. Assessments were taken before and after 
each intervention, and 8-weeks later.
RESULTS: The combination of tSCS+SBLTT led to greater increases in hip and knee 
extension than SBLTT only for three participants. Three children also became 
more plantarflexed at the ankle during stance after tSCS+SBLTT compared to SBLTT 
only. While tSCS+SBLTT reduced spasticity, these changes were only weakly 
correlated with changes in musculotendon lengths during gait or PROM, with the 
largest correlation between change in gastrocnemius operating musculotendon 
length during fast walking and gastrocnemius spasticity (R2 = 0.26) and change 
in plantarflexor PROM and gastrocnemius spasticity (R2 = 0.23).
SIGNIFICANCE: Children with CP used a more upright, less crouched posture during 
gait after tSCS+SBLTT. Large reductions in spasticity after tSCS+SBLTT were only 
weakly correlated with changes in kinematics and PROM. Understanding the 
mechanisms by which tSCS may affect gait for children with CP is critical to 
optimize and inform the use of tSCS for clinical care.

balance perturbations applied during walking. We quantified local medial 
gastrocnemius (MG) and tibialis anterior (TA) neuromechanics using cine B-mode 
ultrasound and surface electromyography before, during, and after the 
perturbation. Our findings partially supported the hypothesis that anticipated 
perturbations would elicit greater proactive agonist muscle adjustments than 
unanticipated perturbations. Though, these adjustments were direction-dependent; 
MG showed greater activation in anticipation of accelerations while TA 
activation did not change in anticipation of decelerations. Our findings 
contradicted our second hypothesis that unanticipated perturbations would elicit 
larger reactive agonist muscle responses than anticipated perturbations. 
Anticipated perturbations elicited greater agonist muscle excitations with no 
changes in muscle fascicle kinematics during the perturbed and recovery strides, 
suggesting that anticipation allows for greater force responsiveness of distal 
leg muscles when disrupted by a perturbation. Our results may inform remote 
monitoring of stability and balance using portable measurement tools, such as 
EMG and ultrasound, to monitor muscle dynamics in real time and mitigate the 
risk of falls.

Local dynamic stability (LDS) of gait has been used to differentiate between 
healthy and injured populations, establishing its potential as an indicator of 
healthy gait and a new objective measure to assess gait function following 
injury. For LDS to be a reliable assessment tool of healthy gait progression 
during rehabilitation, it must provide consistent and sensitive inter-session 
measures. Methodological factors such as trial duration, gait variable, and 
Lyapunov Exponent (LyE) algorithm can influence LDS estimation and its 
reliability. Young people are a high-risk population for sport-related injuries, 
and running is a key activity during rehabilitation and is regularly assessed. 
Therefore, the effects of run duration, gait variable, and LyE algorithm choice 
on the reliability and sensitivity of inter-session LDS measures in young people 
were investigated. Sixteen healthy participants ran on a treadmill on two 
separate sessions (difference of 7 ± 5 days). LDS was calculated using both the 
Rosenstein and Wolf algorithm for durations of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-min of knee 
flexion angle and medio-lateral acceleration of the pelvis and thorax from each 
session. The relative and absolute reliability between sessions was calculated 
using the intraclass correlation coefficient and standard error of measurement. 
The sensitivity of inter-session LDS change was quantified by the minimal 
detectable change. Results showed that longer run durations produced higher 
relative reliability and a minimum run duration of 4 min is recommended to 
achieve moderate-to-good inter-session reliability across all gait variables and 
LyE algorithms. However, shorter durations of 2-3 min may still be sufficient 
when using medio-lateral pelvis acceleration or knee flexion angle, particularly 
with the Rosenstein algorithm, which also improves sensitivity to change. These 
findings provide practical guidance for methodological choices when calculating 
LDS in young people during running and support their potential use as reliable 
tools for monitoring gait function and tracking rehabilitation progress in young 
people following injury.

INTRODUCTION: Breathing and postural control is reported to be both 
neuromuscularly and mechanically interdependent. To date, the effects of 
voluntary abdominal and thoracic breathing (VAB and VTB) on the EMG activity of 
muscles involved in both respiratory and postural functions, as well as gait 
biomechanics related to these breathing patterns, have not been investigated in 
young, healthy adults. The aim of the study was to evaluate the EMG responses of 
neck and trunk muscles, as well as the kinematic, stability, and kinetic 
parameters of gait induced by VAB and VTB compared to involuntary breathing 
(INB).
METHODS: Twenty-four healthy, physically active participants (12 men and 12 
females) were required to complete three two-minute walking sessions on an 
instrumented treadmill (e.g. devices with capacitive sensors embedded beneath 
the running belt) at 5.0 km h-1, first with INB and then alternatively with VAB 
and VTB. A respiratory inductive plethysmography unit was used to provide 
real-time visual feedback of the breathing pattern performed by each 
participant. The EMG activity of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM), upper trapezius 
(UT), thoracic and lumbar erector spinae (TES and LES), as well as 
spatiotemporal (step width, stride length, stride time, stance phase, swing 
phase, and cadence), stability (anteroposterior and mediolateral center of 
pressure trajectory), and dynamic gait parameters (vertical ground reaction 
forces, vGRF) were recorded during each testing condition.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed that both voluntary breathing patterns 
significantly affected the EMG activity of the SCM (p < 0.01) and UT (p < 0.05), 
with the activity between these muscles, as expressed by the SCM:UT ratio, being 
more balanced during VAB (0.94) and VTB (1.05) compared to INB (0.73). 
Additionally, VAB walking led to a narrower step width (p < 0.01) and reduced 
vGRF over the forefoot (p < 0.01) compared to INB walking. Neither VAB nor VTB 
influenced the activation levels of the LES and TES, nor did they affect other 
spatiotemporal, stability, or dynamic gait parameters (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that certain gait parameters (e.g. step width, 
forefoot vGRFs) are primarily influenced by VAB compared to INB, likely due to 
the more balanced activation of the SCM and UT muscles. This balanced activation 
may enhance head stability and control during walking, thereby contributing to 
improved postural control.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) can experience 
intermittent claudication, which limits walking capacity and the ability to 
undertake daily activities. While exercise therapy is an established way to 
improve walking capacity in people with PAD, it is not feasible in all patients. 
Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) provides a way to passively induce 
repeated muscle contractions and has been widely used as a therapy for chronic 
conditions that limit functional capacity. Preliminary trials in patients with 
PAD demonstrate that stimulation of the leg muscles using a footplate-NMES 
device can be performed without pain and may lead to significant gains in 
walking capacity. Studies, to date, have been small and have not been adequately 
controlled to account for any potential placebo effect. Therefore, the current 
trial will compare the effect of a 12-week programme of footplate-NMES with a 
placebo-control on walking capacity (6 min walking distance) and other secondary 
outcomes in patients with PAD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Foot-PAD trial is a double-blinded, randomised 
placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of a 12-week home-based 
programme of footplate NMES on walking capacity in people with PAD. This is a 
single-centre trial with numerous recruitment locations. A total of 180 
participants with stable PAD and intermittent claudication will be randomly 
assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either footplate-NMES (intervention condition) 
or footplate-placebo (control condition) for two 30 min periods each day for 12 
weeks. The footplate-NMES device will deliver stimulation sufficient to induce 
contraction of the leg muscles and repeated plantar and dorsiflexion at the 
ankles. The footplate-placebo device will deliver a momentary low-intensity 
transient stimulation that is insufficient to induce contraction of the leg 
muscles. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (week 0), mid-intervention (week 
6), postintervention (week 12) and 6 weeks after the completion of the 
intervention (week 18). The primary outcome is walking capacity at week 12, 
measured as maximum walking distance during the 6 min walk test. Secondary 
outcomes will include pain-free walking distance during the 6 min walk test; 
pain-free and maximum walking time during a graded treadmill walking test; 
disease-specific quality of life (Intermittent Claudication Questionnaire), 
self-reported walking impairment (Walking Impairment Questionnaire) and 
accelerometer-derived physical activity levels. Exploratory outcomes will 
include the Ankle-Brachial Index; leg vascular function; perception of 
device-use experience and symptom monitoring throughout the trial using the 
Claudication Symptom Instrument and a pain Visual Analogue Scale.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Foot-PAD trial has received ethics approval from 
the Human Research Ethics Committees of Queensland Health Metro North Hospital 
and Health Service (78962) and the University of the Sunshine Coast (A21659). 
Regardless of the study outcomes, the study findings will be published in 
peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at scientific meetings.

Clinical motion analysis plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment 
of mobility-limiting diseases. Within this assessment, relative (point-to-point) 
tracking of extremities could benefit from increased accuracy. Given the 
limitations of current wearable sensor technology, supplementary spatial data 
such as distance estimates could provide added value. Therefore, we propose a 
distributed magnetic tracking system based on early-stage demonstrators of novel 
magnetoelectric (ME) sensors. The system consists of two body-worn magnetic 
actuators and four ME sensor arrays (body-worn and fixed). It is enabled by a 
comprehensive signal processing framework with sensor-specific signal 
enhancement and a gradient descent-based system calibration. As a pilot study, 
we evaluated the technical feasibility of the described system for motion 
tracking in general (Scenario A) and for operation during treadmill walking 
(Scenario B). At distances of up to 60 cm, we achieved a mean absolute distance 
error of 0.4 cm during gait experiments. Our results show that the modular 
system is capable of centimeter-level motion tracking of the lower extremities 
during treadmill walking and should therefore be investigated for clinical gait 
parameter assessment.

This study aimed to assess the intraday reliability of markerless gait analysis 
using an RGB-D camera versus a traditional three-dimensional motion analysis 
(3DMA) system with and without a simulated walking assistant. Gait assessments 
were conducted on 20 healthy adults walking on a treadmill with a focus on 
spatiotemporal parameters gathered using the RGB-D camera and 3DMA system. The 
intraday reliability of the RGB-D camera was evaluated using intraclass 
correlation coefficients (ICC 1, 1), while its consistency with the 3DMA system 
was determined using ICC (2, 1). The results demonstrated that the RGB-D camera 
provided high intraday reliability and showed strong consistency with 3DMA 
measurements regardless of the presence of an assistant. The Bland-Atman 
analysis indicated no significant systematic bias, with the minimum detectable 
change remaining within acceptable clinical ranges. These findings highlight the 
potential of the RGB-D camera for reliable markerless gait analysis in clinical 
environments in which walking assistance may be needed, thereby expanding its 
applicability in patients with various impairment degrees. Future research 
should validate these results in patient populations and explore their utility 
for measuring kinematic parameters.

Continuous relative phase (CRP) quantifies coordination for cyclic motions as 
the difference in the phase portrait locations between its constituent 
coordinates and has been widely used in populations with neuromuscular 
impairments. Continuous analyses, like statistical parameter mapping (SPM), 
provide greater resolution than traditional techniques that first compress CRP 
across a section of the cycle to a single point, like mean average relative 
phase (MARP). However, both analyses neglect the effect of intermediate event 
timing (e.g. toe-off), on coordination. Given this deficit and the notion that 
some people with transtibial amputations (PwTA) may not benefit from powered 
prostheses due to altered coordination, we computed lower extremity CRPs from 5 
PwTA walking with their own passive prostheses and a powered device on a 
treadmill, as well as 5 matched able-bodied individuals (ABI). We then compared 
results from non-parametric SPMs to those from MARP using a 10-40-10-40 gait 
phase decomposition and extracted relative phase at the events that 
theoretically delineate the decomposition. We found continuous, discrete 
analyses matched well, particularly near ankle ""push-off"" (∼55 % gait cycle) 
with all methods identifying differences in shank-foot coordination between the 
ABI group and PwTA group walking with the powered device. Although it is unclear 
why the powered prosthesis promotes more in-phase shank-foot CRP, potential 
covariates include limb posture and device control. In tandem with altered event 
timing, these factors may not only influence coordination, but also illuminate 
why some PwTA do not reduce their energy expenditure when walking in powered 
ankle prostheses.

PURPOSE: To assess physiological metrics during the use of a commercially 
available bilateral active ankle exoskeleton during a challenging 
military-relevant task and if use of the exoskeleton during this task 
influences: metabolic load, physiological measures or rate of perceived 
exertion.
METHODS: Nine healthy volunteers (5M, 4F) completed this randomized cross-over 
design trial, with a baseline visit and two randomized test sessions 
(with/without the exoskeleton). Variables included impact on time to exhaustion 
during walking on a treadmill at varying speeds and gradients (0-15%) at 26.7°C, 
50% humidity with a loaded rucksack (30% body weight). The primary outcome 
measure was change in metabolic cost with/without the exoskeleton (O2 
consumption, metabolic equivalents); secondary outcomes were change in heart 
rate and perceived exertion between conditions.
RESULTS: Participants averaged 22.4 ± 4.5 years old, 173.7 ± 7.4 cm tall, 
weighed 80.9 ± 13.9 kg, and VO2max of 43.8 ± 10.6 mL/kg/min. Total kcals did not 
differ between conditions (with/without exoskeleton; t = 0.98; p = 0.357). 
Kcals/min were significantly lower (1.06 kcals/min) with the exoskeleton (t = 
3.94; p = 0.004). Average oxygen consumption (VO2) was significantly lower (2.36 
mL/kg/min) with the exoskeleton (t = 2.81; p = 0.023), and peak VO2 was 3.33 
mL/kg/min lower with the exoskeleton (t = 2.37; p = 0.045). Peak and Average 
METS were also lower with the exoskeleton by 0.98 (t = 2.61; p = 0.031) and 1.23 
(t = 2.39; p = 0.044) respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest a powered ankle exoskeleton may decrease energy 
consumption during military relevant tasks when conducted in a laboratory 
environment. There may also be physiological benefits such as reduced core 
temperate and heart rate. Replication of this work in the field environment is 
warranted.

Gait disturbance is one of the most common symptoms in patients with Parkinson's 
disease (PD) that is closely associated with poor clinical outcomes. Recently, 
video-based human pose estimation (HPE) technology has attracted attention as a 
cheaper and simpler method for performing gait analysis than marker-based 3D 
motion capture systems. However, it remains unclear whether video-based HPE is a 
feasible method for measuring temporospatial and kinematic gait parameters in 
patients with PD and how this function varies with camera position. In this 
study, treadmill and overground walking in 24 patients with early PD was 
measured using a motion capture system and two smartphone cameras placed on the 
near-frontal and lateral sides of the subjects. We compared the differences in 
temporospatial gait parameters and kinematic characteristics between joint 
position data obtained from the 3D motion capture system and the markerless HPE. 
Our results confirm the feasibility of analyzing gait in patients with PD using 
HPE. Although the near-frontal view, where the heel and toe are clearly visible, 
is effective for estimating temporal gait parameters, the lateral view is 
particularly well-suited for assessing spatial gait parameters and joint angles. 
However, in clinical settings where lateral recordings are not feasible, 
near-frontal view recordings can still serve as a practical alternative to 
motion capture systems.

BACKGROUND: Advanced age brings a loss of plantar sensation, represented, for 
example, as higher sensation thresholds in standardized testing. This is thought 
to contribute to an increased risk of falls among older adults - an intuitive 
premise that has yet to be fully investigated, especially in the context of 
walking balance. The purpose of this study was to quantify the association 
between plantar sensation and the instability elicited by a suite of walking 
balance perturbations that differ in direction and context in a cohort of n = 28 
older adults (73.0 ± 5.9 yrs).
METHODS: We measured plantar sensation using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments and 
quantified margins of stability (MoS) and whole-body angular momentum (WBAM) 
during habitual walking and in response to optical flow perturbations, lateral 
waist-pull perturbations, and treadmill-induced slips.
RESULTS: Our two major results were that higher monofilament thresholds (i.e., 
worse plantar sensation) in older adults associated with: (1) larger 
anterior-posterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) MoS and increased transverse plane 
WBAM (p ≤ 0.031) during habitual walking, and (2) larger decreases in MoSAP, 
MoSML and larger increases in transverse plane WBAM in response to lateral waist 
pull perturbations (p ≤ 0.018). We found no associations between plantar 
sensation and responses to other perturbation contexts.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is an association between worse plantar 
sensation and gait instability, both during habitual unperturbed walking and in 
response to some perturbation contexts. These results should build confidence 
that interventions designed to improve plantar sensation for older adults, 
possibly through insoles or footwear modifications, could be critical for

BACKGROUND: Falls are a global health concern facing older adults. Ballet 
emphasizes postural control, coordination, and leg muscle strength. Previous 
work indicated young professional ballet dancers adapt more effectively to 
repeated standing-slips than non-dancers as evidenced by better reactive 
improvements in dynamic gait stability and step latency. However, it remains 
unknown if older ballet dancers would show a quicker motor learning process than 
non-dancers. This study tested how older recreational ballet dancers adapt to 
five repeated standing-slip perturbations compared to non-dancers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty older recreational dancers and 23 age- and 
sex-matched non-dancers experienced five unexpected slips while standing on a 
treadmill. The primary outcome was the slip-faller rate. Secondary outcomes 
included the percent change from first to last slip in kinematic measurements: 
dynamic gait stability, recovery stepping (step latency, duration, length), and 
trunk angle.
RESULTS: Dancers showed a faster reduction in the slip-faller rate from the 
first to last standing-slip compared to the non-dancers (p = 0.004). The dancers 
improved dynamic gait stability at the recovery step touchdown more than the 
non-dancers (p = 0.002). The dancers increased their step duration (p = 0.006) 
more than the non-dancers across the five standing-slips, and dancers exhibited 
better improvement in trunk angle at recovery touchdown (p = 0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: Older ballet dancers adapt faster to repeated standing-slips and 
can improve their slip-faller rate more quickly compared to non-dancers. Dancers 
also improve their step duration and trunk angle as related to balance loss 
recovery, which may be attributed to their ballet practice.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the kinematic changes in the knee 
joint during walking in patients with isolated PCL-deficiency (PCLD) to 
determine the presence of walking-related joint instability (mechanical 
instability-abnormal displacement form structural damage). Additionally, the 
study seeks to provide biomechanical insights into the observed differences 
between subjective and objective assessments.
METHODS: 35 healthy volunteers and 27 patients with isolated PCLD (both involved 
and uninvolved sides) were included in the study. All participants walked on a 
treadmill at a self-selected comfortable speed. An optical 3D motion capture 
system was employed to collect six degrees of freedom kinematic data of the knee 
joint during walking. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) was employed, using 
independent and paired t-tests to evaluate differences between the healthy 
control group and the PCLD group, as well as between the involved and uninvolved 
sides, respectively.
RESULTS: Compared with the healthy control group, posterior tibial displacement 
(the main indicator for anterior-posterior instability) of the involved limb was 
significantly decreased during 79%-94%. additionally, knee flexion angles of the 
involved limb were significantly increased compared with healthy control group 
during 0%-5% and 95%-99% of the gait cycle and significantly decreased during 
66%-87%; In the uninvolved side, adaptive gait changes were observed, with knee 
flexion angles significantly reduced during 20%-50% and 64%-89% of the gait 
cycle and posterior tibial displacement significantly reduced during 60%-94% 
compared with the healthy control group; Compared to the uninvolved limb, the 
involved limb showed increased internal rotation during 62%-71% of the gait 
cycle and increased knee flexion during 8%-53%, with no significant differences 
in other dimensions.
CONCLUSION: From a biomechanical perspective, patients with PCL rupture exhibit 
no joint instability during walking. Compared to the healthy control group, the 
involved leg shows a significant reduction in posterior tibial displacement and 
a diminished range of knee flexion. Clinical evaluations of PCLD should 
incorporate dynamic functional assessments, thereby providing a more 
comprehensive basis for treatment decisions.

BACKGROUND: The alignment of a bone-anchored prosthesis has consequences for the 
external moments around the residual joints and implant, and these external 
moments can lead to serious negative long-term effects. A clear understanding of 
the relationship between transtibial prosthetic alignment and external joint and 
implant moment for bone-anchored prosthetic users is still lacking.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect of systematic frontal plane prosthetic 
alignment changes on lower limb external joint moments in people with a 
transtibial bone-anchored prosthesis?
METHODS: Participants underwent gait analysis on an instrumented dual belt 
treadmill. Between analyses, frontal-plane alignment adjustments were made, 
shifting the prosthetic foot 2, 4, and 6 mm medial and lateral in relation to 
the residual limb. The effect of alignment changes on frontal- and sagittal 
plane external joint moments during the stance phase of gait were assessed at 
the hip, knee, and implant level, using statistical parametric mapping 
regression analyses.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven unilateral transtibial bone-anchored prosthesis users were 
included. Alignment changes had a significant effect on external frontal plane 
knee and implant moments on the prosthetic side, with the largest effect at the 
level of the implant. Incremental medial and lateral displacements resulted in a 
progressive increase or decrease of the external adduction moments, 
respectively. Alignment changes did not significantly affect external moments 
around the prosthetic hip, non-prosthetic joints in the frontal plane or in any 
of the evaluated joints or implant in the sagittal plane.
SIGNIFICANCE: Mediolateral foot alignment changes have a considerable effect on 
the frontal plane external knee and implant moments at the prosthetic side of a 
transtibial bone-anchored prosthesis. The findings of this study can help 
prosthetists to anticipate and adjust alignment changes for transtibial BAP 
users to minimize joint moments before issues arise.

Stride-to-stride fluctuations are natural in gait. These fluctuations are marked 
by inter-individual variability, suggesting that different fluctuation 
strategies (i.e., phenotypes) may exist. This study investigates the presence of 
gait fluctuation phenotypes. Whole-body kinematics were measured from young, 
healthy males and females (N = 51) while walking on a treadmill at their 
preferred speed. Motor fluctuation metrics (i.e., magnitude of variability, 
local dynamic stability, and regularity) were measured for 32 joint angles 
across the upper and lower body. These metrics were reduced to principal 
components (PCs) via principal component analysis and then grouped into clusters 
using the k-means method. One-way ANOVAs were conducted to test for cluster 
differences in motor fluctuation PCs. Three PCs were extracted, explaining 
39.7 % of all 96 motor fluctuation metrics. Higher PC1 scores represent more 
fluctuation across all joints, higher PC2 scores represent greater upper limb 
fluctuations with fewer fluctuations in the lower limb, and PC3 scores represent 
less regularity in fluctuations. PC scores best grouped into four clusters in 
54.0 % of iterations. Clusters 1-4 each had a significantly different PC1 score 
(p < 0.022), and Cluster 3 had a higher PC2 score than all other clusters 
(p < 0.022). Motor fluctuations in treadmill gait of young adults were 
characterised by four gait fluctuation phenotypes, interpreted as repeaters, 
replacers, moderate fluctuators, and mixed fluctuators (i.e. more upper limb but 
fewer lower limb fluctuations); extending the repeaters vs replacers hypothesis. 
The identified phenotypes add a new perspective that may help clarify the link 
between motor fluctuations and gait instability.

In the last few years, we have seen the gradual spread of a new treadmill 
training modality, which involves walking not on the flat but downhill, also 
known as ""downhill"". This review aims to qualitatively assess the efficacy of 
downhill treatment on different patient populations and outline treatment routes 
for future efficacy studies. We searched five different databases: MEDLINE, 
SCOPUS, Web of Science, PEDro, and LILACS for studies to include. Only 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English were considered. PEDro 
scales and Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) assessment were used to evaluate the risk of 
bias. Forty-one RCTs were included, and three articles remained to be analyzed; 
the included studies showed 110 participants for three RCTs; of these, two were 
performed on patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), while one was for treating people with multiple sclerosis (MS). The 
outcome measures used in the studies were the pulmonary function test, the 
cardiopulmonary exercise test, the 6-Minute Walking Test, and the St. George 
Respiratory Questionnaire. In patients diagnosed with COPD, downhill training 
appears effective on functional capacity and symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue, 
while in people with MS, it increases strength and activity performance when 
compared to other walking training modalities. RoB 2 tool shows good 
methodological quality for all studies included in the review; when evaluated 
with the PEDro scale, all presented a score of 8. Downhill could be such an 
effective, safe, and feasible eccentric training modality that it can be 
considered a new rehabilitation strategy that could be implemented for patients 
with low exercise tolerance.

Walking on compliant terrains, like carpets, grass, and soil, presents a unique 
challenge, especially for individuals with mobility impairments. In contrast to 
rigid-ground walking, compliant surfaces alter movement dynamics and increase 
the risk of falls. Understanding and modeling gait control across such soft and 
deformable surfaces is thus crucial for maintaining daily mobility. However, 
access to the necessary equipment for modeling compliant surface walking is 
limited. Therefore, in this paper, we present the first publicly available 
biomechanics dataset of 20 individuals walking on terrains of varying 
compliance, using a unique robotic device, the Variable Stiffness Treadmill 2 
(VST 2), designed to simulate walking on adjustable compliant terrain. VST 2 
provides a consistent and reproducible environment for studying the biomechanics 
of walking on such surfaces within laboratory settings. The goal of this dataset 
is to provide insights into the muscular, kinematic, and kinetic adaptations 
that occur when humans walk on compliant terrain in order to design better 
controllers for prosthetic limbs, improve rehabilitation protocols, and develop 
adaptive assistive devices that can enhance mobility on compliant surfaces.

BACKGROUND: Treadmill-based gait training is part of rehabilitation programs 
focused on walking abilities. The use of handrails embedded in treadmill systems 
is debated, and current literature only explores the issue from a behavioral 
perspective.
METHODS: We examined the cortical correlates of treadmill walking in healthy 
participants using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. We investigated 
whether the utilization of treadmill handrails at varying walking speeds could 
affect cortical activation associated with the task, and we evaluated potential 
differences in task-based functional connectivity across the various walking 
conditions.
RESULTS: Significant differences in cortical activation were found between the 
two walking speeds (3 and 5 km/h) in the unsupported condition; these 
differences were reduced when using the handrails. Specifically, cortical 
activation was significantly higher when the participants swung their arms 
freely while walking at a speed of 5 compared to 3 km/h in several Brodmann's 
Areas (BA): left BA10, BA3 and BA39, and right BA10, BA9, BA8, BA3, and BA40. No 
significant differences were found when participants were holding onto the 
handrails. A significant difference was found in the left BA40 between the two 
speeds, regardless of whether the participants were holding onto the handrails. 
Furthermore, at the higher speed and without the use of handrails, a wider 
pattern of task-based functional connectivity was observed, with significantly 
stronger connectivity between the left BA10 and BA40.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that speed and handrails use play a role in walking 
cortical activity patterns, therefore they are key ingredients to take into 
account when planning a rehabilitation program.

OBJECTIVE: In this feasibility study, firstly, we aimed to assess whether 
intramuscular pH (IMpH) could be measured with a glass-tipped electrode. 
Secondly, we aimed to explore whether we could monitor changes in skeletal 
muscle pH before and throughout static (isometric) and after dynamic (treadmill) 
exercise, comparing individuals with intermittent claudication (IC) to a group 
of healthy controls.
METHODS: Forty participants with IC (mean age ± SD) 68 ± 8) and 40 healthy 
volunteers (63 ± 10) were recruited. Participants in the IC group had an ankle 
brachial pressure index of <0.7 (mean: 0.62 ± 0.13). The first 20 participants 
in each group underwent isometric ankle dorsiflexion for 120 s at 30% of maximum 
voluntary contraction and the remainder underwent treadmill exercise (3.6 km/h, 
5° incline) to maximal walking distance. A sterilised reusable 1.5 mm 
shatterproof, heat strengthened glass tipped pH probe inserted using a 
peripheral venous cannula and in combination with a pH meter was used to measure 
IMpH of the tibialis anterior muscle prior to, during and continuously for 1 h 
after exercise.
RESULTS: Resting IMpH was similar between the groups (median 6.8 (interquartile 
range (IQR) 6.7-6.9)) for IC individuals and 6.7 (6.6 to 6.8) for controls). 
Following isometric exercise, the magnitude of the decrease in IMpH was greatest 
in the IC group (median ΔpH max. in patients -0.2 (IQR: -0.2 to -0.1) versus 
-0.1 (IQR: -0.2 to -0.1) in the control group (p = 0.002). After treadmill 
exercise, the magnitude of the decrease in IMpH (ΔpH max) was greatest in 
individuals with IC (median ΔpH max. in patients -0.3 (IQR: -0.3 to -0.3) versus 
0 (IQR: -0.2 to 0) in the control group, p = 0.04.
CONCLUSIONS: IMpH monitoring with a flexible glass probe inserted into the 
tibialis anterior muscle is viable and changes in IMpH during static and dynamic 
exercises are detected.

During their daily lives humans are often confronted with sustained cognitive 
activities (SCA) leading to state fatigue, a psychobiological state 
characterized by a decrease in cognitive and/or motor performance and/or an 
increase in perception of fatigue. It was recently shown that performing SCA can 
impair overground dual-task gait performance in older adults, but it is 
currently unknown whether there is a task- and/or age-specific modulation in 
gait performance during treadmill walking. Therefore, the effect of a SCA on 
single- and dual-task treadmill walking performance was investigated in young 
and old adults. Using a crossover design, spatio-temporal gait parameters of 24 
young and 23 older healthy participants were measured using motion capturing 
during single- and dual-task (including three cognitive interference tasks: word 
list generation, arithmetic, and Stroop-task) treadmill walking before and after 
SCA (30 min Stroop-task) and a control task (reading). Moreover, cognitive 
fatigue, wakefulness, mood, and arousal were assessed. Although the SCA induced 
age-specific perceptual responses, no difference was found for cognitive 
performance during the Stroop-task. The cognitive interference task performance 
(word list generation, arithmetic, and Stroop-task) during walking on the 
treadmill did not decrease after the SCA. Single- and dual-task gait performance 
(e. g., step width and step length) specifically changed after the SCA and after 
the reading control task in both groups. Data indicate that perceived cognitive 
fatigue has an impact on single- and dual-task treadmill walking performance, 
with task- and age-specific differences. Although no general age-specific 
changes in single- and dual task gait performance following SCA were identified, 
perceived cognitive fatigue should be considered as an intrinsic risk factor for 
falls.

BACKGROUND: Nocturnal blood pressure dipping is crucial for cardiovascular 
health, but the effect of exercise on this phenomenon is not well understood. 
This study aims to investigate how a single session of aerobic exercise impacts 
nocturnal blood pressure dipping in individuals with hypertension who are on 
medication.
METHODS: Twenty hypertensive adults (67 ± 16 years) participated in a 
randomised, parallel-group clinical trial. They were randomly assigned to either 
an exercise or control group. Resting blood pressure was measured after a 
20-minute period of comfortable seating in a calm environment. The exercise 
group performed 40 min of treadmill running/walking at an intensity of 60-70% of 
their reserve heart rate. The control group remained seated for an equivalent 
period with reading allowed. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was used to 
measure blood pressure over 24 h. Nocturnal dip was calculated by comparing the 
mean wakefulness and sleep blood pressure values.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the exercise and 
control groups in systolic and diastolic blood pressure values at rest, during 
wakefulness, sleep, or over 24 h. The absolute nocturnal dip also showed no 
significant differences between the groups for systolic blood pressure (MD = 
3.00 [95% CI: -4.77 to 10.77] p = 0.428) or diastolic blood pressure (MD = 4.60 
[95% CI: -2.81 to 12.00] p = 0.208). Similarly, the relative nocturnal dip 
(percentage) did not differ significantly for systolic blood pressure (MD = 
0.029 [95% CI: -0.039 to 0.837] p = 0.465) or diastolic blood pressure (MD = 
0.047 [95% CI: -0.036 to 0.132] p = 0.250).
CONCLUSIONS: A single session of aerobic exercise does not impact the nocturnal 
dip in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in medication-controlled 
hypertensive individuals.

To investigate the effects of differing treadmills on impact acceleration and 
muscle activation.
METHODS: 15 males and 7 females (27.8 ± 7.7yrs), engaged in two sessions of 
high-incline walking (HIW), and low-incline jogging (LIJ) on different deck 
systems (cushioned) treadmills (TM1 and TM2). Sessions lasted 5-minutes, and 
participants maintained a self-selected pace matched for each session. EMG 
markers were placed over the Tibialis Anterior (TA), Soleus (SOL), Lateral 
Gastrocnemius (LG), Biceps Femoris (BF), Gluteus Maximus (GM), Anterior Deltoid 
(AD), Vastus Lateralis (VL), and the Erector Spinae (ES). Trident Inertial 
Measurement Units (IMU) were attached to the foot and sacrum. EMG activity, 
impact accelerations, heart rate, and RPE were collected at the 4-minute 
30-seconds mark.
RESULTS: Peak EMG was higher for LG (p = 0.005), SOL (p = 0.010), and BF (p < 
0.001) on TM1 compared to TM2, while AD exhibited lower peak activation during 
HIW compared to LIJ on TM2 (p = 0.010). The integral EMG activity increased for 
AD, ES, VL, SOL, LG, and GM only during HIW for both TM1 and TM2. However, only 
integral EMG activation of BF and LG differed between TM1 and TM2 during HIW. 
Foot and sacrum resultant acceleration was notably lower during HIW compared to 
LIJ on both TM1 and TM2. HR was significantly higher on TM1 (171.2 ± 24.8bpm) 
compared to TM2 (164.62 ± 23.7 bpm, p < .05) during HIW (p < .001), and RPE also 
differed between TM1 (13.96 ± 1.96) and TM2 (13.09 ± 1.97) during HIW (p < .05).
CONCLUSION: At the same speed (correspond to an RPE of 11) and grade, treadmill 
design may impact peak and integral muscle EMG patterns, RPE, and HR responses.

High-incline walking is a relatively new trend with little comparative 
information. This study compared physiological and psychological differences 
between high-incline walking at 20% grade (HIW) and level-grade jogging (LGJ) at 
isocaloric intensities in young adults. Twenty-two participants (M = 11, F = 11) 
aged 19-31 years completed the study. Participants completed HIW and LGJ on a 
treadmill for twenty minutes on two separate occasions and matched at isocaloric 
intensities. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE), maintainability (HCM), and 
affective valence using the Feeling Scale (FS) were measured at minutes 2, 10, 
and 20. Gas exchange and heart rate (HR) were continuously recorded. 
Post-exercise, participants completed the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale 
(PACES) and 0-100 Likelihood scale. Relative oxygen uptake between LGJ and HIW 
(24.25 ± 3.53; 24.11 ± 3.63 mL/kg/min; p = .570, d = -.12), total calories (LGJ 
= 169.78 ± 35.80; HIW = 171.07 ± 35.09 kcal; p = .504), RER (LGJ = .86 ± .03; 
HIW = .88 ± .04; p = .137), and HR (LGJ = 146.28 ± 18.29; HIW = 143.94 ± 21.26 
bpm; p = .146) was not different. LGJ (96.82 ± 15.76) had significantly higher 
total PACES (96.82 ± 15.76) and Likelihood scores (75.86 ± 18.30) than HIW 
(85.14 ± 15.08, p < .001; 65.09 ± 25.45, p = .032) respectively. RPE for both 
LGJ and HIW increased significantly with time (p < .001), but not between tests 
(p = .312). FS for LGJ and HIW increased significantly between tests (p = .008), 
but not between time (p = .083). At isocaloric intensities, young adults 
preferred and enjoyed LGJ relative to HIW.

Calcium supplementation before exercise attenuates the decrease in serum calcium 
and increase in PTH and bone resorption. This study investigated the effect of 
calcium supplementation on calcium and bone metabolism during load carriage in 
women. Forty-eight women completed two load carriage sessions (load carriage 1 
n = 48; load carriage 2 n = 40) (12.8 km in 120 min carrying 20 kg) 60 min after 
consuming either 1000 mg calcium (Calcium) or nothing (Control) in a randomised 
order. Pre- and post-exercise urine samples were analysed for calcium isotope 
ratio (δ44/42Ca). Fasted blood samples were taken before (pre-exercise), during 
(0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 min), and after (+15, +30, +60, +90 min) exercise 
and analysed for markers of calcium and bone metabolism. There was no effect of 
load carriage or supplementation on urine δ44/42Ca (P≥.110). Serum δ44/42Ca did 
not change with load carriage in Control (P=.617) but increased in Calcium 
(P=.003) and was higher at 120 min in Calcium vs Control (P=.018). Ionised 
calcium (iCa) decreased from pre-exercise to all exercise time-points (P<.001); 
iCa was higher in Calcium than Control throughout (P<.001). PTH increased from 
pre-exercise to 120 min in Control (P<.001) but decreased from pre-exercise to 
all time-points in Calcium (P<.001). PTH was higher in Control than Calcium from 
0 to +90 min (P<.001). βCTX decreased from pre-exercise to 20 to +15 min in 
Control (P≤.004); βCTX decreased from pre-exercise to 0 to +90 min in Calcium 
(P<.001). βCTX was lower in Calcium than Control from 20 to +90 min (P≤.036). A 
1000 mg calcium supplement before load carriage promotes bone calcium balance 
and prevents disruptions to bone and calcium homeostasis.

Plain Language Summary: Strenuous exercise can place a high mechanical and 
metabolic demand on the skeleton and disturb calcium metabolism. Calcium 
supplementation before exercise can prevent this disturbance. This study 
investigated the effect of calcium supplementation on calcium and bone 
metabolism during load carriage exercise in women. Forty-eight women (military 
n = 38; civilian n = 10; average age 29 years) volunteered. Each participant 
completed a load carriage exercise session on two separate occasions in a 
randomised order; one with a 1000 mg calcium supplement (Calcium) 60 min before 
load carriage and one without (Control). Participants walked 12.8 km on the 
treadmill at 6.4 km∙h-1 for 120 min whilst wearing a 20 kg rucksack. Venous 
blood samples were drawn pre-, during, and post-load carriage from an indwelling 
cannula. Venous blood samples were analysed for biochemical markers of bone and 
calcium metabolism. Calcium supplementation increased serum ionised calcium, 
lowered parathyroid hormone, and lowered bone resorption in the Calcium 
condition compared with the Control condition. Calcium supplementation had no 
effect on markers of bone formation. Consuming a 1000 mg calcium supplement 
60 min before load carriage is protective of bone and calcium homeostasis.

INTRODUCTION: Exercise is a simple, safe, and affordable solution that can be 
easily taught to men with chronic illnesses to improve their psychological 
burden and sexual health.
AIM: Since the role of exercise in ameliorating the psychological burden 
associated with erectile dysfunction (ED) in hepatitis C (HC) men was not 
explored, this research aimed to explore this role.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This HC study was a randomized-controlled 
exercise-rehabilitation trial. Recruitment of HC men with ED was conducted from 
El-Sahel Teaching Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. Men (n = 46) were randomly assigned to 
a 12-week walking-exercise group (WEG, n = 23 HC men with ED received a 1-hour 
treadmill walking 3 times weekly) or a control group (n = 23 HC men with ED, who 
did not change their daily physical activity during the research period). 
Besides Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), Arabic Version of the Five-Item 
Version International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), Profile of Mood 
States Questionnaire (POMSQ), and Ten-Statement Rosenberg self-esteem scale 
(TSRSE), HC participants' liver enzymes, alanine transaminase (ALT), and 
aspartate transaminase (AST) were assessed.
RESULTS: Significant improvements of POMSQ, BDI, AST, IIEF-5, ALT, and TSRSE 
within the WEG only were seen. No significant changes occurred in the control 
group's parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise (walking) is a good modality to improve liver enzymes, ED, 
and ED-associated psychological burden (depression, low self-esteem, and mood 
disturbances) in HC men with ED.

Changes to the variability within biomechanical signals may reflect a change in 
the health of the human system. However, for running gait variability measures 
calculated from wearable device data, it is unknown whether a between-day 
difference reflects a shift in system dynamics reflective of a change in human 
health or is a result of poor between-day reliability of the measurement device 
or the biomechanical signal. This study investigated the reliability of stride 
time and sacral acceleration variability measures calculated from inertial 
measurement units (IMUs). Nineteen runners completed six treadmill running 
trials on two occasions seven days apart. Stride time and sacral acceleration 
signals were obtained using IMUs. Stride time variability and complexity were 
calculated using the coefficient of variation (CV) and detrended fluctuation 
analysis (DFA), respectively. Sacral acceleration regularity was quantified 
using sample entropy with a range of input parameters m (vector length) and r 
(similarity threshold). Between-day reliability was assessed using the 
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM) 
and minimum detectable change. Stride time CV displayed moderate relative 
reliability (ICC = 0.672), but with a large absolute minimum detectable 
change = 0.525 %, whilst stride time DFA-α displayed poor relative reliability 
(ICC = 0.457) and yielded large minimum detectable changes (≥ 0.208). Sample 
entropy displayed good relative reliability in mediolateral and resultant sacral 
acceleration signals for certain combinations of the parameters m and r, 
although again with large minimum detectable changes. Researchers should be 
cognisant of these reliability metrics when interpreting changes in running gait 
variability measures in clinical contexts.

Over 50% of individuals with lower limb loss report a fear of falling and 
avoiding daily activities partly due to a lack of plantar sensation. Providing 
direct somatosensory feedback via neural stimulation holds promise for 
addressing this issue. In this study, three individuals with lower limb loss 
received a sensory neuroprosthesis (SNP) that provided plantar somatosensory 
feedback corresponding to prosthesis-floor interactions perceived as arising 
from the missing foot generated by electrically activating the peripheral nerves 
in the residuum. Participants walked on a treadmill while receiving 
perturbations involving brief increases in the belt speed. Perturbations were 
initiated during early stance and randomly delivered to intact and prosthetic 
sides with the SNP active or inactive. With the SNP active, participants 
exhibited decreased trunk angular sway and peak trunk flexion angular velocity 
during recovery from both prosthetic and intact side perturbations. For 
prosthetic side perturbations, peak ground reaction force magnitudes decreased 
when the SNP was active. For intact side perturbations, peak ground reaction 
force magnitudes increased on the prosthetic side's first recovery step after 
the perturbation, which resulted in a more symmetric recovery because the force 
approached the response on the intact side's first recovery step following a 
prosthetic side perturbation. These results suggest participants integrated the 
feedback from the SNP into their sensorimotor control for maintaining stability 
and gained confidence in relying on their prosthetic limb during recovery. 
Restoring plantar sensation with a SNP for individuals with lower limb loss 
could lead to reduced risk of falling by improving recovery from trips.

Although guidelines are established for performing the six-minute walking test 
(6MWT), it is not always possible to implement this test in any setting, due to 
physical and space limitations. Yet, variations in the conditions of the test 
could be responsible for heterogeneous outcomes. However, the impact of the 
condition of the 6MWT is not clearly established in literature. The objective is 
to determine the influence of different implementation conditions on the 
validity of the 6MWT. Seventeen articles were retained after a literature 
review, including 597 participants. Seven articles mention that performing the 
test on a predetermined short back-and-forth pathway led to lower performance 
than when the test was performed on pathways of greater distances. The walking 
distance covered on a rectangular path or on a 10-m eight-form path is greater 
than with the back and forth on a five- to ten-meter path. Seven articles 
suggest that the performance achieved on a treadmill is generally lower than 
that obtained while walking on the ground. Evidence shows that the conditions 
while performing the 6MWT significantly influence the score, hence the validity 
of the results. The use of a ground pathway, comprising the longest linear 
distance possible, seems critical to ensure good validity.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the effect of a novel supervised exercise 
therapy (SET) program based on intermittent treadmill walking and circuit-based 
moderate-intensity functional training (MIFT) on walking performance and HRQoL 
in PAD patients.
DESIGN: All participants underwent a 12-week SET that involved 15 to 30 minutes 
of treadmill walking followed by a 15-minute moderate-intensity functional 
training (MIFT) continued by 12-week of follow-up. Maximum walking distance 
(MWD), pain-free walking distance (PFWD), gait speed and estimated peak oxygen 
uptake (peak VO2) were calculated through the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) and 
HRQoL through the Short Form-36 (SF-36) and the Vascular Quality of Life 
Questionnaire-6 (VascuQol-6).
RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between 
baseline and post-intervention for walking performance outcomes [MWD (MD: 88.53 
m), PFWD (MD: 62.89 m), gait speed (MD: 0.24 m·s-1) and peak VO2 (MD: 2.04 
ml·kg-1·min-1)] and for HRQoL [physical functioning in SF-36 (MD: 6.93 points) 
and VascuQol-6 (MD: 1.46 points)]; while no differences were found between 
baseline and 12-week follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Results seem to show that 12-week of novel SET based on intermittent 
walking and MIFT induced significant clinical improvements in key functional 
variables of PAD while cessation of exercise leads to significant negative 
clinical changes in subsequent weeks of follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Treadmill belt perturbations have high clinical feasibility for use 
in perturbation-based training in older people, but their kinematic validity is 
unclear. This study examined the kinematic validity of treadmill belt 
accelerations as a surrogate for overground walkway trips during gait in older 
people.
METHODS: Thirty-eight community-dwelling older people were exposed to two 
unilateral belt accelerations (8 m s-2) whilst walking on a split-belt treadmill 
and two trips induced by a 14 cm trip-board whilst walking on a walkway with 
condition presentation randomised. Anteroposterior margin of stability (MoS), 
number of falls, and trunk and lower limb kinematics were quantified for the 
step prior and five recovery steps following the treadmill perturbations and the 
walkway trips which elicited elevating and lowering strategies.
FINDINGS: Rates of falls following the treadmill accelerations and walkway trips 
were 0% and 13.1%, respectively. MoS was similar during the first recovery step 
(P>0.05) but less negative during subsequent recovery steps following treadmill 
belt accelerations than walkway trips (P<0.01) regardless of recovery strategy. 
Excluding the first recovery step in the lowering strategy, recovery step 
lengths, toe clearance, maximum trunk, hip and knee angles (P<0.05) were smaller 
during recovery on the treadmill compared to the walkway.
INTERPRETATION: Destabilisation by treadmill belt accelerations quickly 
dissipated after only one recovery step but continued for multiple recovery 
steps following walkway trips. Smaller trunk displacement, step lengths, toe 
clearance and no falls on the treadmill indicate treadmill belt accelerations 
may not accurately simulate the biomechanical challenge of obstacle-induced 
trips in older people.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of music tempo on heart 
rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), lactate levels, and aerobic capacity during 
walking exercise in male college students. Ten male college students randomly 
participated in three experiments using various music tempos on a treadmill 
device to prevent data contamination between measurements by allowing a 2-week 
interval. Walking exercise was performed at a moderate intensity of 60%-70% 
maximum HR for 30 min, with participants divided into three groups based on 
music tempo: exercise group with fast tempo music (ExF, 120-160 bpm), exercise 
group with slow tempo music (ExS, 60-70 bpm), and exercise group without music 
(Ex). The study was designed using a randomized crossover method. Two-way 
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) assessed group-by-time 
interactions, and one-way ANOVA was used to compare differences between groups. 
Post hoc analysis was performed using Tukey honestly significant difference. As 
a result, the ExF group had higher HR, ventilation, metabolic equivalent, and 
oxygen up-take during treadmill exercise than the ExS or Ex group. But there was 
no significant interaction of HR and HRV during recovery according to music 
tempo. HRV was significantly higher in the ExF group during exercise when 
compared to other groups. Blood lactate concentration was significantly 
decreased in the ExS group. These findings provide new information that music 
tempo type applied during treadmill exercise might have a positive effect on the 
maximum oxygen intake and lactate accumulation in the recovery phase.

Walking is one of the most common forms of self-motion in humans. Most humans 
can walk effortlessly over flat uniform terrain, but also a variety of more 
challenging surfaces, as they adjust their gait to the demands of the terrain. 
In this, they rely in part on the perception of their own gait and of when it 
needs to be adjusted. Here, we investigated how well N = 48 participants 
detected speed differences between two belts of a split-belt treadmill. As 
participants walked at a constant speed, we either accelerated or decelerated 
one of the belts at quasi-random intervals and asked participants to judge their 
relative speeds in a two-alternative forced-choice task. Using an adaptive 
psychophysical procedure, we obtained precise perception-threshold estimates for 
inter-leg speed differences after accelerating or decelerating one belt. We 
found that most participants could detect even very small speed differences, 
with mean threshold estimates of just over 7% for both perturbation types. These 
were relatively stable within, but highly variable across participants. 
Increased-speed and decreased-speed thresholds were highly correlated, 
indicating that despite different biomechanics, the detection mechanisms might 
be similar. This sheds light on how perceiving their own motion helps humans 
manage interlimb coordination in perturbed walking.

BACKGROUND: VM202 is a plasmid encoding two isoforms of hepatocyte growth 
factor. In preclinical studies, hepatocyte growth factor stimulated angiogenesis 
and muscle regeneration. This preliminary clinical trial tested the hypothesis 
that VM202 injections in gastrocnemius muscle would improve walking performance 
in people with mild to moderate and symptomatic lower extremity peripheral 
artery disease (PAD).
METHODS: In a double-blind clinical trial, patients with PAD were randomized to 
gastrocnemius muscle injections of either 4 mg of VM202 or placebo every 14 days 
for four treatments. The primary outcome was 6-month change in 6-minute walk 
distance. Secondary outcomes included 3-month change in treadmill walking time 
and gastrocnemius muscle biopsy measures. In this preliminary trial, statistical 
significance was prespecified as a one-sided P value of less than .10.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine participants with PAD (64.1% Black, 28.2% female) were 
randomized. Adjusting for age, race, smoking, and baseline performance, VM202 
did not improve 6-minute walk at 6-month follow-up, compared with placebo (-13.5 
m; 90% confidence interval [CI], -38.5 to +∞). At the 3-month follow-up, VM202 
improved the maximum treadmill walking time (+2.38 minutes; 90% CI, +1.08 to +∞; 
P = .014) and increased central nuclei abundance in gastrocnemius muscle (+5.86; 
90% CI, +0.37 to +∞; P = .088), compared with placebo. VM202 did not 
significantly improve pain-free walking distance (difference, +0.30 minutes; 90% 
CI, -1.10 to +∞; P = .39), calf muscle perfusion (difference, +1.80 mL/min per 
100 g tissue; 90% CI, -3.80 to +∞; P = .33), or the Walking Impairment 
Questionnaire distance score (difference, +2.02; 90% CI, -8.11 to +∞; P = .40). 
In post hoc analyses, VM202 significantly improved 6-minute walk in PAD 
participants with diabetes mellitus at 6-month follow-up (+34.19; 90% CI, 4.04 
to +∞; P = .075), but had no effect in people without diabetes (interaction P = 
.079).
CONCLUSIONS: These data do not support gastrocnemius injections of VM202 to 
improve 6-minute walk in PAD. Secondary outcomes suggested potential benefit of 
VM202 on skeletal muscle measures and treadmill walking, whereas post hoc 
analyses suggested benefit in PAD participants with diabetes.

healthy humans.

The phase-dependent modulation pattern of the tibialis anterior (TA) flexion 
reflex was characterized during treadmill walking while transspinal stimulation 
was delivered at 15, 30, and 50 Hz above and below paresthesia in healthy 
participants. The flexion reflex was elicited following medial arch foot 
stimulation with a 30 ms (300 Hz) pulse train. During treadmill walking, the 
flexion reflex was evoked in the right leg every 3-5 steps, and stimuli were 
randomly dispersed across the step cycle that was divided into 16 equal bins. 
For each participant, condition and bin of the step cycle, the flexion reflex 
was measured as the area of the linear EMG envelope starting 20 ms after the end 
of the pulse train up to 200 ms and was normalized to the maximum locomotor TA 
EMG activity. The unconditioned flexion reflex was modulated in a 
phase-dependent manner. Transspinal stimulation, regardless frequency, or 
intensity produced pronounced flexion reflex depression during walking that 
coincided with an unchanged slope and intercept, computed from the linear 
relationship between the flexion reflex and background EMG activity. These 
findings suggest that transspinal stimulation above and below paresthesia 
intensities at 15, 30, and 50 Hz downregulates the flexion reflex. Based on our 
recently reported absent effects on the soleus H-reflex under similar conditions 
and our current findings we propose that transspinal stimulation downregulates 
flexion and not extension reflex pathways. More research is needed to delineate 
whether similar neuromodulation effects are present in flexion and extension 
reflexes after spinal cord injury in humans.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Transspinal 
stimulation over the thoracolumbar region above and below paresthesia 
intensities at 15, 30, and 50 Hz produces a generalized depression of the 
tibialis anterior flexion reflex during walking in healthy participants. This 
finding supports strong actions of transspinal stimulation on spinal neuronal 
networks engaged in walking. This finding may be helpful for recovery of walking 
after spinal cord injury in humans because suppression of exaggerated flexion 
reflexes enables smooth stance-to-swing transition and foot clearance.

Foot strike patterns influence vertical loading rates during running. Running 
retraining interventions often include switching to a new foot strike pattern. 
Sudden changes in the foot strike pattern may be uncomfortable and may lead to 
higher step-to-step variability. This study evaluated the effects of running 
with an imposed and usual foot strike on vertical loading rate variability and 
amplitude. Twenty-seven participants (16 men and 11 women; age range: 18-30 
years) ran on an instrumented treadmill with their usual foot strike for 10 min. 
Then, the participants were instructed to run with an unusual foot strike for 6 
min. We calculated the vertical instantaneous and vertical average loading rates 
and their variances over 200 steps to quantify vertical loading rate 
variability. We also calculated the amplitude and variability of the shank 
acceleration peak using an inertial measurement unit. The vertical loading rate 
and shank acceleration peak amplitudes were higher when running with a rearfoot 
strike, regardless of the foot strike conditions (i.e., usual or imposed). The 
vertical loading rate and shank acceleration peak variability were higher when 
running with an imposed rearfoot strike than when running with a usual forefoot 
strike. No differences were found in the vertical loading rate and shank 
acceleration peak variabilities between the imposed forefoot strike and usual 
rearfoot strike conditions. This study offers compelling evidence that adopting 
an imposed (i.e., unusual) rearfoot strike amplifies loading rate and shank 
acceleration peak variabilities.

This study investigated the effects of ankle dorsiflexion angle adjustments in 
ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) on the gait of healthy individuals. Fifteen healthy 
participants engaged in treadmill walking tasks while wearing AFOs with 
dorsiflexion angles set at 0°, 5°, 10°, and 15°. Three-dimensional treadmill 
gait analysis was used to collect data during treadmill walking. The analysis 
focused on toe clearance and the contribution of the vertical component of limb 
shortening (LS), and compared them across different dorsiflexion angles. The 
results indicated a significant increase in toe clearance at 10° (median 
[interquartile change]: 5.03 [0.90] vs. 5.98 [1.18], p < 0.01) and 15° (5.03 
[0.90] vs. 5.82 [1.11], p < 0.01) dorsiflexion angle conditions compared to the 
0° condition. Similarly, LS demonstrated significant increases at 10° (4.89 
[1.97] vs. 5.87 [1.31], p < 0.01) and 15° (4.89 [1.97] vs. 5.61 [1.65], p < 
0.01) conditions when compared with the 0° condition. These findings support the 
notion that higher dorsiflexion angles in AFOs lead to increased toe clearance 
and LS, suggesting the effectiveness of dorsiflexion angle adjustments as a 
strategy to address reduced toe clearance.

Intensity in Patients Post Stroke.

BACKGROUND: Indirect calorimetry is the gold standard field-testing technique 
for measuring energy expenditure and exercise intensity based on the volume of 
oxygen consumed (VO2, mL O2/min). Although heart rate is often used as a proxy 
for VO2, heart rate-based estimates of VO2 may be inaccurate after stroke due to 
changes in the heart rate-VO2 relationship. Our objective was to evaluate in 
people post stroke the accuracy of using heart rate to estimate relative walking 
VO2 (wVO2) and classify exercise intensity. Moreover, we sought to determine if 
estimation accuracy could be improved by including clinical variables related to 
patients' function and health in the estimation.
METHODS: Sixteen individuals post stroke completed treadmill walking exercises 
with concurrent indirect calorimetry and heart rate monitoring. Using 70% of the 
data, forward selection regression with repeated k-fold cross-validation was 
used to build wVO2 estimation equations that use heart rate alone and together 
with clinical variables available at the point-of-care (i.e., BMI, age, sex, and 
comfortable walking speed). The remaining 30% of the data were used to evaluate 
accuracy by comparing (1) the estimated and actual wVO2 measurements and (2) the 
exercise intensity classifications based on metabolic equivalents (METs) 
calculated using the estimated and actual wVO2 measurements.
RESULTS: Heart rate-based wVO2 estimates were inaccurate (MAE = 3.11 mL 
O2/kg/min) and unreliable (ICC = 0.68). Incorporating BMI, age, and sex in the 
estimation resulted in improvements in accuracy (MAE Δ: -36.01%, MAE = 1.99 mL 
O2/kg/min) and reliability (ICC Δ: +20, ICC = 0.88). Improved exercise intensity 
classifications were also observed, with higher accuracy (Δ: +29.85%, from 0.67 
to 0.87), kappa (Δ: +108.33%, from 0.36 to 0.75), sensitivity (Δ: +30.43%, from 
0.46 to 0.60), and specificity (Δ: +17.95%, from 0.78 to 0.92).
CONCLUSIONS: In people post stroke, heart rate-based wVO2 estimations are 
inaccurate but can be substantially improved by incorporating clinical variables 
readily available at the point of care.

Korea.

This pilot study explored how muscle activation influences the pattern 
recognition of tactile cues delivered using electrical stimulation (ES) during 
each 10% window interval of the normal walking gait cycle (GC). Three healthy 
adults participated in the experiment. After identifying the appropriate 
threshold, ES as the haptic cue was applied to the gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) 
and biceps brachii (BB) of participants walking on a treadmill. Findings 
revealed variable recognition patterns across participants, with the BB showing 
more variability during walking due to its minimal activity compared to the 
actively engaged GL. Dynamic time warping (DTW) was used to assess the 
similarity between muscle activation and electro-stimulated haptic perception. 
The DTW distance between electromyography (EMG) signals and muscle recognition 
patterns was significantly smaller for the GL (4.87 ± 0.21, mean ± SD) than the 
BB (8.65 ± 1.36, mean ± SD), showing a 78.6% relative difference, indicating 
that higher muscle activation was generally associated with more consistent 
haptic perception. However, individual differences and variations in recognition 
patterns were observed, suggesting personal variability influenced the 
perception outcomes. The study underscores the complexity of human neuromuscular 
responses to artificial sensory stimuli and suggests a potential link between 
muscle activity and haptic perception.

Middle and Long Latency Cutaneous Reflexes During the Stance Phase of Gait in 
Individuals with and Without Chronic Ankle Instability.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Lower limb cutaneous reflex amplitudes can modulate 
across gait, which helps humans adjust rhythmic motor outputs to maintain 
balance in an ever-changing environment. Preliminary evidence suggests people 
who suffer from repetitive ankle sprains and residual feelings of giving way 
demonstrate altered cutaneous reflex patterns in the gastrocnemius. However, 
before cutaneous reflex assessment can be implemented as a clinical outcome 
measure, there is a need to substantiate these early findings by measuring 
reflex amplitudes across longer latency periods and exploring the variability of 
reflexes within each subject.
METHODS: Forty-eight subjects with and without chronic ankle instability (CAI) 
walked on a treadmill at 4 km/h while activity of the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) 
was measured via surface electromyography. Non-noxious stimulations were 
elicited randomly to the ipsilateral sural nerve at the mid-stance phase of 
gait, and reflex amplitudes were calculated offline by comparing muscle activity 
during unstimulated and stimulated gait cycles. Two primary outcome measures 
were compared between groups at the middle latency (MLR: 80-120 ms) and late 
latency (LLR: 120-150 ms) time windows: (1) average reflex amplitudes and (2) 
standard deviation of reflex amplitudes for each subject across 10 trials.
RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated an equal amount of LG inhibition at the MLR 
and LG facilitation at the LLR. However, subjects with CAI showed significantly 
higher variability in LLR amplitude across trials than healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased variability of cutaneous reflex amplitudes may relate to 
symptoms associated with CAI. These findings suggest that reflex variability 
following sural nerve stimulation could serve as an objective measure to track 
treatment progress in patients with CAI, offering clinicians a new tool for 
conducting rehabilitation assessments in a controlled environment.

One of the key hallmarks of Parkinson's disease is the disruption of lipid 
homeostasis in the brain, which plays a critical role in neuronal membrane 
integrity and function. Understanding how treadmill training impacts lipid 
restructuring and its subsequent influence on motor function could provide a 
basis for developing targeted non-pharmacological interventions for individuals 
living with early stage of PD. This study aims to investigate the effects of a 
treadmill training intervention on motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA in rats 
model of PD. PD was induced by injecting 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA) into the 
medial forebrain bundle (MFB). For 10 weeks, rats underwent treadmill training 
on a four-lane motorized treadmill. Motor function deficits were evaluated 
through behavioral tests. Lipidomic analysis was performed through 
ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC 
MS/MS). Treadmill intervention significantly improved motor function and 
restored altered brain and muscle lipid profiles in PD rats. Among the lipid 
species identified in PD rats, brain abundance was highest for 
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), correlating positively with the beam-walking 
scores; muscle abundance peaked with lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE), 
correlating positively with grip strength scores. In the brain, the levels of 
diacylglycerol (DG), triacylglycerol (TG), and lysophosphatidylcholine (PC) 
correlated positively with grip strength and rotarod scores, while only 
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) linked to beam-walking scores. In the muscle, the 
levels of phosphatidylinositol (PI), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 
lysophosphatidic acid (PA), ceramide (Cer), and ganglioside were positively 
correlated with grip strength and rotarod scores. In conclusion, treadmill may 
protect the cortex, mitigating motor deficits via change lipid profiles in the 
brain and muscle.

BACKGROUND: Advanced technologies are becoming increasingly accessible in 
rehabilitation. Current research suggests technology can increase therapy 
dosage, provide multisensory feedback, and reduce manual handling for 
clinicians. While more high-quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of 
rehabilitation technologies is needed, understanding of how to effectively 
integrate technology into clinical practice is also limited. Current 
implementation of rehabilitation technology is inconsistent, with low uptake 
among clinicians and frequent reports of technology abandonment. An Australian 
rehabilitation provider opened a new technology therapy center in 2022, offering 
a unique opportunity to generate practice-based evidence to inform future 
technology implementation and research.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the implementation and adoption of 
advanced technology within a real-world rehabilitation setting.
METHODS: This study was a longitudinal observational study in a rehabilitation 
organization with inpatient, outpatient, and community settings. Allied health 
clinicians (n=119) within the organization had access to advanced technologies, 
with patients receiving neurological, spinal cord injury, brain injury, or 
general rehabilitation. Interventions included 21 advanced technologies, 
including robotic, virtual reality (VR), sensor-based, and functional electrical 
stimulation devices. Clinicians received training for devices in a staged 
approach by external and internal trainers. Data were collected from patient 
electronic medical records from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. Outcomes 
included frequency of advanced technology use, patient demographics (age, 
gender, and primary health condition), clinician discipline, rehabilitation 
service (inpatient, outpatient, or community), goals of technology therapy 
sessions, and therapy dosage achieved (minutes active, number of repetitions, 
and meters walked).
RESULTS: Clinicians used advanced technology 4208 times with 269 patients over 
12 months; specifically, physiotherapists (2716/4208, 65%), occupational 
therapists (1396/4208, 33%), and allied health assistants (96/4208, 2%). The 
majority of patients had stroke, spinal cord injury, or brain injury diagnoses 
(188/269, 70%). Devices were typically used to target impairment and activity 
limitation-related goals. Frequently used devices included gait training 
body-weight support (VR treadmill and overground), overground robotic 
exoskeletons, and upper limb robotic VR devices. Outpatient services were the 
dominant users of advanced technology (3940/4208, 94%). Clinicians most commonly 
used devices for patients with stroke (1973/4208, 47%) and the greatest variety 
of devices for patients with stroke and spinal cord injury. The relative use of 
lower limb robotic devices was greater in inpatient services (91/178, 51%, vs 
outpatient services, 963/2335, 41%) (χ21=6.6, P=.01) and for patients with 
spinal cord injury (48/95, 51%, vs all other conditions, between 24%-31%; 
χ25=16.8, P=.005).
CONCLUSIONS: The type and amount of advanced technology use differed between 
patient populations and rehabilitation settings. To support clinician use of 
advanced technology, devices should match the rehabilitation context. Tailored 
strategies are important, such as clinician training. Further practice-based 
research is required to provide guidance on implementation and to establish the 
effectiveness of advanced technology use.

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) can have more pronounced effects on joint position 
sense (JPS) accuracy and gait characteristics. The aim of this study is to 
investigate the association between lower limb JPS and different aspects of gait 
pattern including gait asymmetry and variability and spatiotemporal coordination 
in individuals with bilateral KOA. In this cross-sectional study, lower limb JPS 
of 43 individuals with bilateral KOA (mild and moderate) were measured. 
Participants' gait patterns during treadmill walking with self-selected 
comfortable speed were assessed. The correlations between JPS errors and gait 
parameters of limb with moderate KOA were analyzed. Positive relationships were 
found between stance time symmetry index and JPS errors of hip abduction (r = 
.46, P = .003), ankle plantar flexion (r = .33, P = .03), and ankle dorsiflexion 
(r = .33, P = .03). Positive relationship was found between single limb support 
time symmetry index and hip abduction JPS error (r = .41, P = .008). Significant 
negative associations were found between coefficient of variation of step length 
and JPS errors of knee extension (r = .47, P = .002) and ankle plantar flexion 
(r = .33, P = .003). Results did not show any significant relationship between 
lower limb JPS errors and walk ratio. It is likely that lower limb JPS deficits 
are partially responsible for some changes in gait patterns observed in 
individuals with bilateral KOA.

Farmers may be at a higher risk of developing hip osteoarthritis (OA) due to the 
high demands of their occupation. To the authors' knowledge, the gait patterns 
of farmers that may be associated with hip joint degeneration have yet to be 
analyzed. Therefore, this study compares gait mechanics between farmers and 
non-farmers (controls). It is hypothesized that farmers would exhibit altered 
lower extremity joint mechanics during walking when compared to matched 
controls. This exploratory study included five farmers and five sex-, age-, and 
body mass index (BMI)-matched controls. A 3D gait analysis was performed while 
study participants walked at a self-selected speed on an instrumented treadmill. 
Sagittal plane hip, knee, and ankle kinetics and kinematics were assessed. 
Effect sizes and between-group differences in demographics and gait mechanics 
were assessed. There were no group differences in walking speed, total stance 
time as well as hip and knee joint kinematics (p > 0.05). Farmers exhibited 
statistical trends (p = 0.07-0.08) of lower peak ankle plantarflexion angles, 
higher plantarflexor moments, higher knee flexion moment impulse, and higher 
peak vertical ground reaction force during the first and second halves of 
stance. Additionally, farmers ambulated with a significantly higher knee 
extensor moment (p = 0.04) and moment impulse (p = 0.05) during the first half 
of stance and a higher ankle plantarflexion moment impulse (p = 0.04). The 
results demonstrate a multi-joint gait alteration in farmers compared to 
non-farmers and may suggest a compensatory gait pattern to optimize hip joint 
mechanics and mitigate hip joint degeneration. These results provide a 
preliminary understanding of the impact that agricultural occupations have on 
joint mechanics that may be associated with the increased prevalence of hip OA 
in the farming population.

BACKGROUND: Increasing one's walking speed is an important goal in post-stroke 
gait rehabilitation. Insufficient arm swing in people post-stroke might limit 
their ability to propel the body forward and increase walking speed.
PURPOSE: To investigate the speed-dependent changes (and their contributing 
factors) in the arm swing of persons post-stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five persons post-stroke (53±12.1 years; 40.72±43.0 
months post-stroke) walked on a treadmill at comfortable (0.83m/s) and fast 
(1.01m/s) speed. Shoulder and elbow kinematics were compared between conditions 
using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) analysis, and discrete parameters 
using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test or an independent sample t-test. The relations 
between speed-dependent changes in shoulder and elbow range of motion and 
clinical and gait parameters were assessed using Spearman correlation 
coefficients.
RESULTS: The non-paretic arm showed expected speed-dependent kinematic 
adaptations with increases in active range of motion for shoulder flexion 
(p<0.001), extension (p<0.05), abduction (p = 0.001), rotation (p = 0.004) and 
elbow flexion (p<0.001). The paretic arm only showed an increase in shoulder 
abduction and elbow flexion (both p<0.001). Persons post-stroke with a more 
impaired arm swing coordination pattern only showed speed-dependent adaptations 
for elbow flexion (p<0.001) at the paretic side during fast walking. In 
contrast, persons post-stroke with a normal arm swing coordination pattern 
presented with increases in active range of motion of the shoulder abduction and 
elbow flexion (both p<0.001) at the paretic side when walking fast. More upper 
limb impairment (r = -0.521, p<0.01) and a wider step width (r = 0.534, p<0.01) 
were related to a larger increase in mean elbow flexion during faster walking.
CONCLUSIONS: Persons post-stroke show different changes in arm swing kinematics 
at the paretic compared to the non-paretic side when increasing walking speed. 
The changes are related to the impairment level and stability during walking, 
indicating that therapeutic interventions aiming to increase walking speed by 
improving arm swing might need to target these factors.

People with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication (IC) 
experience impaired walking due to an imbalance between muscle oxygen supply and 
demand during exercise. Studies with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during 
treadmill tests reveal notable tissue deoxygenation with slow recovery. This 
cross-sectional study aimed to compare behavior of calf muscle oxygenation 
during the incremental shuttle walking test (ISWT) with a continuous treadmill 
test (3.2 km/h, 10% incline) and to correlate NIRS results between tests in PAD 
patients. Sixty individuals with IC, 37 men (61.7%), mean age 66.25 ± 10.35 
years participated in the study. Both tests were performed on the same day with 
a 30-minute rest, in randomized order. NIRS-derived calf muscle tissue 
oxygenation variables were measured at rest and during exercise. Typical PAD 
tissue oxygenation patterns were observed in both tests, with significant 
differences (p < 0.05) in oxygenation values during exercise for the variables 
delta of tissue oxygen saturation (ΔStO2) and reoxygenation rates. All tissue 
oxygenation variables analyzed, except reoxygenation rate, showed a significant 
and directly proportional correlation between the two tests. These results 
suggest that NIRS during ISWT could be a viable method for assessing tissue 
oxygenation in PAD.

BACKGROUND: Reduced step length is a hallmark of gait disturbance in people with 
Parkinson's disease (PD). Although treadmill training is effective for improving 
step length, the associated neural mechanisms have not been fully investigated. 
Moreover, exploring the baseline neurophysiological predictors for step length 
improvement after training could facilitate personalized gait rehabilitation for 
PD.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroplastic changes in 
corticomotor excitability after treadmill training and to explore whether 
baseline neurophysiological measures could predict step length improvement in 
PD.
METHODS: Data from 61 participants with idiopathic PD who completed 12 treadmill 
training sessions were included. Gait performances and corticomotor excitability 
measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were obtained at baseline, 
postintervention, and 1-month follow-up. TMS outcomes included motor-evoked 
potentials, cortical silent period (CSP), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and 
short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI). General estimating equation 
analysis and principal-component analyses were used to determine the 
neuroplastic changes induced by training, and multiple linear regression 
analysis was performed to explore the baseline TMS predictors for step length 
improvement at 1-month follow-up.
RESULTS: After treadmill training, SICI and CSP significantly increased and 
shared an emerging relationship. Regression analysis showed that female sex and 
greater baseline ICF and SICI were significant predictors of step length 
improvement at the follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: This study advanced the understanding of neuroplastic changes 
induced by treadmill training in PD and showed that preserved SICI and ICF were 
predictors for lasting step length improvement after training. Future studies 
could investigate other influential factors for treadmill training in PD. © 2024

Although exercise is medicine for outpatients with schizophrenia, it is unclear 
if one-year adherence-supported exercise leads to a ""tipping point"", at which 
the exercise becomes a routine manifested as life-long training in the patient 
group.
METHODS: Forty-eight outpatients (28 men/20 women: 35 ± 11 (mean ± SD) years) 
with schizophrenia (ICD-10: F20-29) were randomised to: 1) collaborative care 
group (TG), performing aerobic interval (AIT; 4 × 4-min treadmill 
walking/running at ∼90 % peak heart rate) and leg press maximal strength 
training (MST; 4 × 4 repetitions at ∼90 % maximal strength [1RM]) 2d·wk.-1 for 
1-year, supported by transportation and training supervision; or 2) control 
group (CG). Peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak) and walking work efficiency were 
measured directly along with scaled 1RM/power, anthropometry, blood pressure, 
and blood samples at inclusion, 1-year, and 5-years post-intervention.
RESULTS: The TG increased V̇O2peak (11 %, p < .01), scaled 1RM (40 %, p < .001), 
and power (26 %, p < .001) compared to CG after 1-year. At follow-up, no 
intergroup differences in these factors were observed (all p > .05). Both groups 
improved walking work efficiency (TG: 11 %; CG: 18 %; both p < .05) after 1-year 
(no intergroup difference, p > .05), but not at follow-up (both p > .05). At 
follow-up, HDL (high-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol (-15 %, p < .01) and 
glucose (26 %, p < .01) decreased/increased(respectively) more in the TG than 
CG. No other intergroup differences were observed in anthropometry or blood 
samples.
CONCLUSION: 1-year adherence-supported high-intensity training improves 
V̇O2peak, 1RM, and power in outpatients with schizophrenia. However, the 
improvements in these factors key to longevity are not maintained after 5 years. 
These findings highlight the importance of long-lasting cost-efficient adherence 
support, ultimately affecting the population's prognosis.

The role of the human ankle joint in activities of daily living, including 
walking, maintaining balance, and participating in sports, is of paramount 
importance. Ankle joint dorsiflexion and plantarflexion functionalities mainly 
account for ground clearance and propulsion power generation during locomotion 
tasks, where those functionalities are driven by the contraction of ankle joint 
skeleton muscles. Studies of corresponding muscle contractility during ankle 
dynamic functions will facilitate us to better understand the joint torque/power 
generation mechanism, better diagnose potential muscular disorders on the ankle 
joint, or better develop wearable assistive/rehabilitative robotic devices that 
assist in community ambulation. This data descriptor reports a new dataset that 
includes the ankle joint kinematics/kinetics, associated muscle surface 
electromyography, and ultrafast ultrasound images with various annotations, such 
as pennation angle, fascicle length, tissue displacements, echogenicity, and 
muscle thickness, of ten healthy participants when performing volitional 
isometric, isokinetic, and dynamic ankle joint functions (walking at multiple 
treadmill speeds, including 0.50 m/s, 0.75 m/s, 1.00 m/s, 1.25 m/s, and 
1.50 m/s). Data were recorded by a research-use ultrasound machine, a 
self-designed ankle testbed, an inertia measurement unit system, a Vicon motion 
capture system, a surface electromyography system, and an instrumented 
treadmill. The descriptor in this work presents the results of a data curation 
or collection exercise from previous works, rather than describing a novel 
primary/experimental data collection.

BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disease 
affecting joint mechanics. Considering the effect of step-width changes on the 
biomechanics of gait, especially the alteration of stability dynamics during 
narrow-base gait, this study investigated the kinematic parameters of the lower 
extremities during both normal and narrow-base walking in individuals with and 
without KOA.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 20 individuals with bilateral KOA and 20 
controls was conducted. Participants walked on a treadmill at a preferred speed 
across normal and narrow paths. Joint angles and angular velocities in the 
sagittal and frontal planes were recorded, and mixed ANOVA was used to analyze 
group × condition effects.
RESULTS: Significant main effects of walking condition were observed for hip 
(p = 0.001) and ankle angles (p = 0.002) in the frontal plane, and knee 
(p = 0.004) and ankle angular velocities (p = 0.002) in the sagittal plane. 
Moreover, there were significant main effects of group on the hip (p = 0.01) and 
knee angles (p = 0.04) in the sagittal plane. KOA group showed higher peak hip 
adduction (p < 0.001) and ankle inversion (p = 0.02]) during narrow-base walking 
than on the normal path. People with KOA had also significantly higher peak 
angular velocity of knee flexion (p = 0.03), ankle dorsiflexion (p = 0.002), and 
ankle inversion (p = 0.03) during narrow-base walking.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that KOA and narrow-base gait challenges may 
trigger distinct kinematic adaptation strategies, potentially contributing to 
cartilage degeneration and altering balance mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Unrestricted kinematic alignment (uKA) in total knee arthroplasty 
(TKA) has the theoretical advantage of reproducing patients' constitutional 
alignment and restoring the pre-arthritic joint line position and obliquity. 
However, modifications of the original uKA technique have been proposed due to 
the potential risk of mechanical failure and instability. Given the significant 
variability in soft tissue behavior within the same bony morphology group, uKA 
pure knee resurfacing could be occasionally detrimental. This study aimed to 
kinematically compare the outcomes of uKA TKA with those of a robotic-assisted 
KA TKA technique based on specific soft-tissue boundaries.
METHODS: In this retrospective gait analysis study, 24 TKA patients and 12 
healthy controls were recruited. Inclusion criteria were a 9-month minimum 
follow-up from successfully, primary medial-pivot or medially-congruent TKA 
performed for isolated degenerative joint disease. Preoperatively, patients were 
randomly assigned to two surgical groups: A) uKA (#12) and B) robot-assisted 
(#12), KA (hybrid-kinematic) with boundaries (±3° from hip-knee-ankle neutral 
axis) and a slight intercompartmental gap asymmetry (max 2 mm lateral-opening). 
The gait analysis was performed using instrumented treadmills equipped with 3D 
cameras.
RESULTS: Sagittal knee kinematic data: during the early-stance phase of gait, 
the uKA group showed a less consistent weight-acceptance phase and a less 
efficient transition between the first knee-flexion peak and 
mid-stance-extension plateau with respect to the hybrid-kinematic alignment 
group. Spatiotemporal and overall gait quality data: no significant differences 
were found between the two TKA groups regarding walking speed (P = .51) and step 
length (P = .8534). Control group patients walked more efficiently compared to 
TKA groups, showing inferior trunk flexion and inferior variation in step length 
(P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that restoring the pre-arthritic joint line, as 
advocated by surgeons following the uKA philosophy, does not guarantee a 
closer-to-normal knee kinematics.

The present study aimed to investigate changes in corticospinal excitability 
(CSE) by observing unnatural walking patterns on a treadmill with different left 
and right belt speeds. Fifteen healthy adults watched video clips (10 s each) of 
walking under the tied condition (left and right treadmill belt speeds are the 
same), walking during the initial and late periods under the split-belt 
condition (left and right treadmill belt speeds are different), and the static 
fixation cross (control condition) in random order. The step lengths of the 
actor in the walking clips were almost symmetric under the tied condition and 
during the late period under the split-belt condition but largely asymmetric 
during the initial period under the split-belt condition. We recorded the 
motor-evoked potential (MEP) of the left tibialis anterior muscle during the 
observation of video clips by delivering transcranial magnetic stimulation to 
the right primary motor cortex. The MEP amplitude was significantly higher when 
observing walking under the tied condition and walking during the late period 
under the split-belt condition than the control condition. However, the MEP 
amplitudes during the observation of walking during the initial period under the 
split-belt condition and the control condition were not significantly different. 
These results indicate that observation of symmetric walking, even under the 
split-belt condition, facilitates CSE, whereas observation of unnatural 
asymmetric walking does not. Therefore, it is suggested that familiarity with 
observed movements affects CSE even in the observation of semi-automatic 
movements such as walking.

Evidence that myelin repair is crucial for functional recovery in multiple 
sclerosis (MS) led to the identification of bexarotene (BXT). This clinically 
promising remyelinating agent activates multiple nuclear hormone receptor 
subtypes implicated in myelin repair. However, BXT produces unacceptable 
hyperlipidemia. In contrast, IRX4204 selectively activates the retinoid X 
receptor (RXR). Given compelling links between RXR activation and increased 
myelin repair, we employed IRX4204 to investigate the impact of RXR agonism 
alone on functional recovery in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE). Since gait deficits are common in MS, we used machine 
learning to obtain highly sensitive and reliable measurements of sagittal 
hindleg joint movements for mice walking on a treadmill. IRX4204 not only 
blocked the progressive loss of knee and ankle movements but also reversed joint 
movement impairments in EAE mice. Our biochemical, transcriptional and 
histological measurements in spinal cord suggest these gait improvements reflect 
increased axon survival and remyelination and reduced inflammation. Using 
microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, we present 
additional data suggesting that IRX4204 may act on multiple glial subtypes to 
orchestrate myelin repair. These results inform the discovery of restorative 
neural therapeutics for MS by demonstrating that selective RXR agonism is 
sufficient for effective myelin repair. Moreover, our findings support the 
therapeutic potential of IRX4204 to promote functional recovery in MS.

Previous studies established strong links between morphological characteristics 
of mammalian hindlimb muscles and their sensorimotor functions during 
locomotion. Less is known about the role of forelimb morphology in motor outputs 
and generation of sensory signals. Here, we measured morphological 
characteristics of 46 forelimb muscles from six cats. These characteristics 
included muscle attachments, physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and 
fascicle length. We also recorded full-body mechanics and EMG activity of 
forelimb muscles during level overground and treadmill locomotion in seven and 
16 adult cats of either sex, respectively. We computed forelimb muscle forces 
along with force- and length-dependent sensory signals mapped onto corresponding 
cervical spinal segments. We found that patterns of computed muscle forces and 
afferent activities were strongly affected by the muscle's moment arm, PCSA and 
fascicle length. Morphology of the shoulder muscles suggests distinct roles of 
the forelimbs in lateral force production and movements. Patterns of 
length-dependent sensory activity of muscles with long fibres (brachioradialis, 
extensor carpi radialis) closely matched patterns of overall forelimb length, 
whereas the activity pattern of biceps brachii length afferents matched forelimb 
orientation. We conclude that cat forelimb muscle morphology contributes 
substantially to locomotor function, particularly to control lateral stability 
and turning, rather than propulsion. KEY POINTS: Little is known about the role 
of forelimb muscle morphology in producing motor outputs and generating 
somatosensory signals. This information is needed to understand the 
contributions of forelimbs in locomotor control. We measured morphological 
characteristics of 46 muscles from cat forelimbs, recorded cat walking mechanics 
and electromyographic activity, and computed patterns of moment arms, length, 
velocity, activation, and force of forelimb muscles, as well as length- and 
force-dependent afferent activity during walking. We demonstrated that moment 
arms, physiological cross-sectional area and fascicle length of forelimb muscles 
contribute substantially to muscle force production and proprioceptive activity, 
to the regulation of locomotor cycle phase transitions and to control of lateral 
stability. The obtained information can guide the development of biologically 
accurate neuromechanical models of quadrupedal locomotion for exploring and 
testing novel methods of treatments of central nervous system pathologies by 
modulating activities in neural pathways controlling forelimbs/arms.

This study included 107 patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 
undergoing revascularization and aimed to evaluate the effects of body mass 
index (BMI) on outcomes of quality of life (intermittent claudication 
questionnaire - ICQ), pain-free walking distance (PFWD), and maximum 
claudication distance (MCD). The study included 107 patients aged 18-80 years 
with PAD undergoing revascularization (average age 66±6.7 years; 82% men and 18% 
women, average BMI 28.02±4.35). The diagnosis of PAD was made based on medical 
opinion and an ankle-brachial index (ABI) value of <0.9. Methods used were BMI 
assessment, PFWD and MCD distances assessment (treadmill test using the 
Gardner-Skinner protocol), and quality of life assessment (ICQ). The examination 
was performed twice - at 1-5 days before the planned revascularization 
(classical surgery, angioplasty, or hybrid) and 3 months after the procedure. A 
statistically significant correlation was demonstrated between the improvement 
of PFWD, MCD, ICQ, and patients' BMI (P<0.01). The worst results were achieved 
by patients with II-degree obesity (PFWD improvement by an average 10.33±0.87, 
MCD of 21.67±3.25, ICQ of 14.01±0.60), while the best results were obtained by 
those with normal body weight (PFWD improvement by an average of 52.57±2.42, MCD 
of 137.20±22.30, ICQ of 21.18±0.54). Patients with a higher BMI have worse PFWD 
and MCD distances and quality of life 3 months after revascularization, which 
indicates the need to consider obesity when planning therapy. Further studies 
are needed to better understand the impact of BMI on the effectiveness of 
treatment and rehabilitation of patients with PAD.

CONTEXT: The Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT) for exercise intolerance 
following concussion may highlight underlying autonomic dysfunction. Autonomic 
function at rest and with exertion may be predictive of neurocognitive 
performance for individuals with sports-related concussion. The purpose of this 
study is to explore the feasibility and utility of combining multimodal 
assessments with heart rate variability (HRV) measures during the BCTT for 
individuals with a remote history of concussion.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study design, pretest/posttest.
METHODS: Participants included 5 males and 5 females (N = 10, age: 25.2 [3.3] y 
old, height: 173.2 [11.2] cm, mass: 73.4 [13.7] kg, body mass index: 24.5 [3.9], 
time since last concussion of 6.3 [4.5] y). All participants completed the 
multimodal assessment battery including: Concentration Reverse Digits (6 
digits), Stroop Incongruent, and King-Devick Test under single- (seated) and 
dual-task conditions (walking on treadmill at 2.0 mph, 0% incline). Heart rate 
and HRV was collected at rest, during the BCTT, and during postexercise 
recovery. HRV data were processed and analyzed based on established protocols. 
Paired t tests were performed for pre- and postmeasurements separately for 
single- and dual-task tests of the multimodal assessment battery and HRV 
indices.
RESULTS: During the BCTT, HRV indices reflective of peripheral nervous system 
activity demonstrated a significant reduction with concomitant increase in HRV 
indices of sympathetic nervous system activity (P < .05). Recovery in these HRV 
indices toward baseline was observed during postexercise recovery. 
Neurocognitive performance on the Stroop task significantly improved with 
exercise (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Implementation of multimodal assessments to evaluate physiological 
and neurocognitive responses to exercise in individuals with history of 
sports-related concussion is feasible. Addition of these objective measures may 
decrease reliance on self-reporting of exercise-induced symptom exacerbation, 
enabling clinicians to identify individuals whose neurocognitive performance or 
physiologic response to exercise on the BCTT deviates from the expected.

BACKGROUND: Most running biomechanics studies have focused on either the 
patellofemoral joint (PFJ) or Achilles tendon (AT) alone, generating fragmented 
understanding of how these structures interact as components of an integrated 
kinetic chain during running. This study was to investigate concurrent 
biomechanical changes in the PFJ and AT in recreational runners.
METHODS: The recreational runners who are accustomed to run with rearfoot strike 
(RFS, n = 15) and forefoot strike (FFS, n = 15) patterns were recruited. They 
were instructed to run at 10 km/h in cushion shoes with their habitual strike 
patterns on an instrumented split-belt treadmill. Kinematics of the ankle and 
knee joints in the sagittal plane and ground reaction forces were recorded 
simultaneously. The contact force and stress at the PFJ, as well as the force, 
loading rate, impulse, and stress of the AT, were calculated.
RESULTS: The habitual RFS runners had significantly higher peak extension moment 
(p = 0.019, ES = 0.906), peak quadriceps force (p = 0.010, ES = 1.008), PFJ 
contact force (p = 0.007, ES = 1.056) and stress (p = 0.042, ES = 0.958) than 
habitual FFS runners. The peak plantar flexion moment (p < 0.001, ES = 2.692), 
peak AT force (p < 0.001, ES = -1.788), average (p < 0.001, ES = -2.337) and 
peak AT loading rate (p < 0.001, ES =-1.996), AT impulse (p = 0.002, ES = 
-1.246) and stress (p = 0.006, ES = -1.082) of the habitual RFS runners were 
significantly lower than those of the habitual FFS runners.
CONCLUSION: The FFS pattern could decrease PFJ load but simultaneously increased 
the mechanical load on the AT. Conversely, the RFS pattern increased PFJ load, 
but imposed less load on the AT.

BACKGROUND: Although the benefits of exercise for kidney transplant recipients 
(KTRs) have been widely demonstrated, these patients experience several barriers 
in undertaking a structured exercise program in hospital and non-hospital 
facilities.
AIM: To compare the effects of a supervised moderate-intensity gym-based 
intervention with a home-based low-intensity walking program on exercise 
capacity in KTRs.
METHODS: KTRs were asked to choose between two six-month programs. The first 
group performed a low-intensity interval walking intervention at home-based 
exercise intervention (HBex). The second group performed a supervised training 
program at an adapted physical activity gym (Sgym), including aerobic and 
resistance training. The outcomes, collected at baseline and at the end of the 
programs, included the 6-minute walking test, the peak oxygen consumption 
(VO2peak) during a treadmill test, the 5-time sit-to-stand test, and blood 
pressure.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients agreed to participate and self-selected into the 
HBex (n = 9) and Sgym (n = 8) groups. Two patients in the Sgym group dropped out 
because of familial problems. At baseline, patients in the HBex group were 
significantly older and had lower walking distance, VO2peak, and lower limb 
strength. Primary outcome changes were significantly greater in the HBex group 
than in the Sgym group (52 ± 23 m vs 8 ± 34; P = 0.005). No other significant 
differences between groups were observed. Both groups improved most of the 
outcomes in the within-group comparisons, with significant variations in VO2 
peak.
CONCLUSION: Six-month moderate-intensity supervised or low-intensity home-based 
training programs effectively improved exercise capacity in KTRs. Gym-based 
programs combine aerobic and resistance training; however, in-home walking may 
be proposed for frail KTRs.

Exoskeletons offer promising solutions for improving human mobility, but a key 
challenge is ensuring the controller adapts to changing walking conditions. We 
present an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven universal exoskeleton system that 
dynamically switches assistance types between walking modes, modulates 
assistance levels corresponding to the ground slope, and delivers assistance 
timely based on the current gait phase in real-time. During treadmill 
validation, AI-based assistance reduced metabolic cost by 6.5% compared to 3.5% 
for conventional assistance. We expanded testing the controller in real-world 
walking, where AI-based assistance showed effective modulation and higher user 
preference compared to conventional assistance. Leveraging the AI-based approach 
and a comprehensive dataset, the controller achieved superior performance in 
environment- and user-state estimations. This approach does not require a 
separate mode classifier and operates on a user-independent basis, enabling 
immediate deployment across diverse conditions. This study highlights the 
potential of AI-driven exoskeletons in facilitating human locomotion in 
real-world ambulation.

BACKGROUND: Fall injuries resulting from trips are a major health concern. 
Virtual reality (VR) offers an effective way of training obstacle avoidance 
while walking due to its ability to provide safe and meaningful real-time 
feedback during rehabilitation. This proof-of-concept study examined the benefit 
of providing physical feedback during obstacle avoidance gait training using VR.
METHODS: Twenty-six young adults walked on an instrumented treadmill while 
wearing a head-mounted display in two 8-min conditions. Virtual obstacles to be 
avoided were presented in a VR-only condition and a VR + Perturbation (VR + P) 
condition where additional rapid belt acceleration simulated tripping on an 
obstacle.
RESULTS: A lower obstacle collision rate, greater step length and height of the 
leading foot over the obstacles were found in the VR + P condition compared to 
the VR-only condition (p < 0.05). Step height of the trailing foot over the 
obstacles significantly decreased over time during the VR-only condition 
(p < 0.01) but not during the VR + P condition. The margin of stability 
significantly improved over time during the VR + P condition only (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Immediate physical feedback via treadmill belt acceleration can 
improve obstacle avoidance performance in a virtual environment. Future research 
is required to examine the generalizability of this finding to other populations 
and real-world falls.

The evaluation of gait biomechanics using portable inertial measurement units 
(IMUs) offers real-time feedback and has become a crucial tool for detecting 
gait disorders. However, many of these devices have not yet been fully 
validated. The aim of this study was to assess the concurrent validity and 
relative reliability of the RunScribe™ system for measuring spatiotemporal gait 
parameters during walking. A total of 460 participants (age: 36 ± 13 years; 
height: 173 ± 9 cm; body mass: 70 ± 13 kg) were asked to walk on a treadmill at 
5 km·h-1. Spatiotemporal parameters of step frequency (SF), step length (SL), 
step time (ST), contact time (CT), swing time (SwT), stride time (StT), stride 
length (StL) and normalized stride length (StL%) were measured through 
RunScribe™ and OptoGait™ systems. Bland-Altman analysis indicated small 
systematic biases and random errors for all variables. Pearson correlation 
analysis showed strong correlations (0.70-0.94) between systems. The intraclass 
correlation coefficient supports these results, except for contact time (ICC = 
0.64) and swing time (ICC = 0.34). The paired t-test showed small differences in 
SL, StL and StL% (≤0.25) and large in CT and SwT (1.2 and 2.2, respectively), 
with no differences for the rest of the variables. This study confirms the 
accuracy of the RunScribe™ system for assessing spatiotemporal parameters during 
walking, potentially reducing the barriers to continuous gait monitoring and 
early detection of gait issues.

in the Neuromuscular Control of Walking Using the Dynamic Motor Control Index.

The dynamic motor control index is an emerging biomarker of age-related 
neuromuscular impairment. To date, it has been computed by quantifying the 
co-activity of eleven lower limb muscles. Because clinics that routinely employ 
electromyography typically collect from fewer muscles, a reduced muscle sensor 
set may improve the clinical usability of this metric of motor control. This 
study aimed to test if commonly used eight- and five-muscle electromyography 
(EMG) sensor sets produce similar dynamic motor control indices as the 
previously examined eleven-muscle sensor set and similarly differentiate across 
age subgroups. EMG data were collected during treadmill walking from 36 adults 
separated into young (N = 18, <35 yrs.), young-old (N = 13, 65-74 yrs.), and 
old-old (N = 5, ≥75 yrs.) subgroups. Dynamic motor control indices generated 
using the sensor set with eleven muscles correlated with the eight-muscle set 
(R2 = 0.70) but not the five-muscle set (R2 = 0.30). Regression models using the 
eleven-muscle (χ2(4) = 10.62, p = 0.031, Nagelkerke R2 = 0.297) and eight-muscle 
(χ2(4) = 9.418, p = 0.051, Nagelkerke R2 = 0.267) sets were significant and 
approaching significance, respectively, whereas the model for the five-muscle 
set was not significant (p = 0.663, Nagelkerke R2 = 0.073). In both the 
eleven-muscle (Wald χ2 = 5.16, p = 0.023, OR = 1.26) and eight-muscle models 
(Wald χ2 = 4.20, p = 0.04, OR = 1.19), a higher index significantly predicted 
being in the young group compared to the old-old group. Age-related differences 
in the neuromuscular control of walking can be detected using dynamic motor 
control indices generated using eleven- and eight-muscle sensor sets, increasing 
clinical usability of the dynamic motor control index.

BACKGROUND: Structural malalignments, such as talar malalignments and hindfoot 
varus, are hypothesized to contribute to early ankle joint degeneration by 
altering joint contact force (JCF). These malalignments, common in individuals 
with chronic ankle instability (CAI), can modify the articular geometry of the 
ankle joint, potentially leading to abnormal joint loading patterns. This study 
leverages musculoskeletal modeling and simulation to conceptualize the effects 
of increasing severity of these malalignments on ankle JCF during walking.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Using a theoretical framework based on biomechanical 
principles, how do increasing talar malalignments and rearfoot varus, as seen in 
CAI patients, influence ankle JCF during walking?
METHODS: A conceptual musculoskeletal modeling approach was employed to simulate 
the effects of structural alterations on ankle JCF in uninjured individuals. 
Using an instrumented treadmill, musculoskeletal modeling was used to estimate 
the effects of increasing talar positional malalignments and/or rearfoot varus, 
both in isolation and in combination, on ankle JCF during the stance phase of 
walking. Variables included peak, impulse, and loading rates for compressive, 
posterior shear, and lateral shear JCF.
RESULTS: Anterior translation and internal rotation of the talus significantly 
increased lateral shear JCF, while an increase in rearfoot varus decreased 
lateral shear JCF (p < 0.01). However, combining modifications of the talus and 
rearfoot varus had no significant effects on ankle JCF.
SIGNIFICANCE: This conceptual analysis highlights the effectiveness of 
musculoskeletal modeling in providing theoretical insights into how CAI-related 
structural malalignments affect ankle joint loading during walking. Talar 
positional malalignments increase lateral shear loading, whereas rearfoot varus 
reduces lateral shear loading. The effects of these structural alterations on 
lateral shear JCF counterbalance each other, highlighting the need to consider 
other factors of CAI to more accurately reflect the ankle JCF in those with CAI.

BACKGROUND: Older adults walk with a diminished foot and ankle push-off compared 
to younger adults and this difference may be a target for assistive devices. 
Dynamic mean ankle moment arm (DMAMA) is an aggregate measure of foot and ankle 
control that varies in younger adults across walking speeds and inclines.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Does age affect DMAMA across a range of walking tasks 
designed to challenge power output from the ankle and foot?
METHODS: We enrolled 12 healthy younger adults and 10 healthy older adults. 
Participants walked on an instrumented treadmill for 2 minutes at a range of 4 
speeds and again, for 2 trials, with their waist attached to a motor-driven 
system that delivered constant 5 % body weight horizontal forces aiding or 
impeding net propulsion. A 12-camera system collected motion capture data and a 
split-belt instrumented treadmill recorded ground reaction forces. We calculated 
DMAMA as the ratio of ankle moment impulse to sagittal ground reaction force 
impulse. DMAMA and its determinants were analyzed using a mixed factorial ANOVA 
for differences across conditions.
RESULTS: Independent of age, DMAMA significantly increased with faster walking 
speed and as demand for net propulsion decreased. However, DMAMA did not differ 
significantly between age groups across conditions. Only ankle moment impulse 
was affected by age, and was smaller in older than younger adults across the 
majority of walking tasks.
SIGNIFICANCE: As an aggregate measure previously proposed as a control parameter 
for assistive devices to augment foot and ankle push-off, DMAMA may apply 
equally well for older and younger adults.

Identifying measures which accurately quantify reactive balance adaptation 
during walking is essential to understand how emerging perturbation-based gait 
paradigms impact stability over the course of an intervention. These 
perturbation paradigms have shown promise in reducing falls for numerous 
clinical populations, however tracking progress in objective terms throughout an 
intervention remains challenging. Whole body angular momentum (H) may be 
particularly suited to detect subtle adaptations in the reactive balance 
response and is applicable within numerous perturbation environments. We 
assessed the ability of young healthy adults to adapt to varying intensities of 
discrete, unexpected, treadmill-based perturbations directed mediolaterally, 
anteriorly, and posteriorly during a single session while ambulating at their 
comfortable walking speed. We assessed corrective step length and width, trunk 
deviation and flexion, peak H over a stride, peak-to-peak differences in 
whole-body angular momentum over a stride (HR), and the participants ability to 
maintain their H trajectory within two standard deviations of their normal 
(PNT). Measures derived from H, particularly HR and PNT, demonstrated 
significant changes with increasing intensity and repetition. Corrective step 
length and width, trunk deviation and flexion, and peak H also demonstrated 
significant, but weaker, differences with increasing intensity and repetition. 
Derivatives of H are sensitive to changes in intensity and repetition, 
particularly when assessed as peak-to-peak differences and ability to maintain a 
normal trajectory over a stride. These measures may be utilized to detect 
changes in reactive balance during perturbation-based gait paradigms.

BACKGROUND: Blood flow restriction caused by peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 
is reflected in reduced walking capacity. The peripheral mechanisms that may 
affect the walking capacity of individuals with PAD are not yet fully 
understood. This study aimed to 1) compare tissue oxygenation and muscle 
metabolism of individuals with PAD with different walking capacities and 2) 
evaluate which variables have the greatest potential to explain the variability 
in distance walked between performance levels.
METHODS: The sample composed of adults diagnosed with PAD underwent evaluation 
of microvascular function in the gastrocnemius muscle through Near-Infrared 
Spectroscopy (NIRS) at two time points: (1) during the arterial occlusion 
maneuver; (2) on a treadmill test with constant speed and inclination (3.2 km/h, 
10 %). The following NIRS parameters were selected: (1) percentage of peripheral 
tissue oxygen saturation (StO2); (2) StO2 delta; (3) reoxygenation rate; (4) 
time to reach lowest StO2; (5) ischemia resistance time; (6) StO2 in reactive 
hyperemia. Participants were divided into tertiles (T1, T2, and T3) according to 
the walking distance in the treadmill test. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
was used for comparisons between tertiles and multiple linear regression was 
used for association analyses.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between tertiles in baseline 
values or delta StO2. The reoxygenation rate and StO2 in hyperemia of the 
occlusion maneuver, as well as the time to reach the lowest StO2 and the 
ischemia resistance time in the treadmill test, were significantly higher in T3 
than in T1 and T2 (p < 0.05). Linear regression demonstrated that the ischemia 
resistance time is the variable that appears to have the greatest influence on 
the distance walked (adjusted R2 = 0.83).
CONCLUSION: Better walking performance was associated with better dynamic 
response capacity to ischemia. Factors such as microvascular, endothelial, and 
muscular dysfunction appear to be decisive in reducing the walking capacity of 
individuals with PAD.

Rehabilitation to prevent falls should not only directly address intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors, but also the neuropsychology of falls to promote safe and 
independent mobility in our aging population. The purpose of this study was to 
determine the relation between falls self-efficacy and objective responses to a 
series of walking balance perturbations. 29 healthy younger adults and 28 older 
adults completed four experimental trials, including unperturbed walking and 
walking while responding to three perturbations: mediolateral optical flow, 
treadmill-induced slips, and lateral waist-pulls; and three self-reported 
questionnaires: Activity-specific Balance Confidence, Falls Efficacy Scale, and 
the Fear of Falling Questionnaire-Revised. We quantified stabilizing responses 
as a change in margin of stability from unperturbed walking. Older adults 
generally exhibited larger instability than younger adults in response to 
walking balance perturbations. Only the Fear of Falls Questionnaire-Revised 
showed an increase in perceived falls risk for older adults. We found no 
significant correlations for older adults between any balance perturbation 
response and questionnaires of self-perception. Given the disconnect between 
self-perceived falls risk and responses to walking balance perturbations, 
rehabilitation to prevent falls while maintaining mobility and independence will 
likely require personalized techniques that combine neuromuscular training with 
approaches for neurophysiological reeducation.

When losing balance, upper-body movements serve as mechanical aids to regain 
stability. However, it remains unclear how these movements contribute to dynamic 
stability during recovery from a lateral loss of balance while walking with arm 
restriction. We aimed to (i) quantify the effect of arm restriction on gait 
stability and upper-body velocities and (ii) characterize upper-body kinematic 
strategies in response to lateral surface translations under different arm 
restriction conditions. Healthy adults were exposed to lateral surface 
translations while walking on a computerized treadmill under three conditions: 
'free arms', '1-arm restricted' and '2-arms restricted'. Dynamic stability and 
upper-body velocities for the first step after perturbation onset were 
extracted. We found decreased dynamic stability in the sagittal plane and 
increased trunk velocity in the '2-arms restricted' condition compared with the 
'free arms' condition. Head and trunk movements in the medio-lateral plane were 
in opposite directions in 44.31% of responses. Additionally, significant trunk 
velocities were observed in the opposite direction to the perturbation-induced 
loss of balance. Our results support the contribution of increased upper-body 
velocities to balance responses following arm-restricted walking perturbations 
and suggest that the '2-arms restricted' condition may be utilized as a 
perturbation-based balance training, focusing on head and trunk responses.

BACKGROUND: Muscle stiffness is commonly associated with a sensation of 
tightness, pain and movement difficulty. It is unclear, however, whether changes 
in muscle stiffness can be objectively identified by myotonometry across time. 
This study investigated whether a myotonometer (MyotonPRO) can detect changes in 
muscle stiffness by delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS).
METHODS: Twenty-three healthy adults participated in this study. DOMS was 
achieved in the gastrocnemii by downhill-backwards walking on a motorised 
treadmill. Subjective ratings of gastrocnemii pain and stiffness were recorded 
using the numerical rating scale. The MyotonPRO was used to record and extract 
objective muscle stiffness data. Recordings were taken at baseline and over a 
three-week recovery period. Spearman's rho correlation analyses were conducted 
between objective measures and subjective ratings of pain and stiffness. 
Repeated measure ANOVA tests were conducted to investigate the effect of DOMS 
over time.
FINDINGS: No significant correlations were found between the objective measures 
and subjective ratings of pain (p = 0.22) or stiffness (p = 0.51). Myotonometry 
identified significant effects of DOMS on muscle stiffness (p < 0.001) over 
time. Significant effects of DOMS on subjective pain and stiffness rating data 
were found over time (p < 0.001).
INTERPRETATIONS: Although DOMS was found to affect objective measures of muscle 
stiffness, these changes were not associated with subjective ratings. Future 
studies could replicate this study using other myotonometry methods to further 
investigate muscle stiffness and involve a larger cohort. Other work should 
investigate muscle stiffness in clinical musculoskeletal conditions resulting 
from injury or chronic pain.

BACKGROUND: Spatiotemporal and kinematic variables during gait undergo 
characteristic changes with aging. However, the relationships between these 
domains, and how these change with aging, have not been extensively 
investigated.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How does age affect relationships between spatiotemporal and 
joint/segment range-of-motion variables during treadmill gait?
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a motion capture system tracked 60 
participants (20-80 years old), walking at self-selected and slow speeds on a 
treadmill. Spatiotemporal (step length, width, time, velocity) and 
range-of-motion (ankle, knee, hip, pelvis, trunk) variables were extracted from 
50 steps at each speed. Mixed-effects models were used to quantify relationships 
between spatiotemporal variables and age, range-of-motion, and interactions 
between age and range-of-motion.
RESULTS: Significant relationships with range-of-motion were found for some 
spatiotemporal variables; the direction of the relationship was most often 
positive, with several negative relationships. Significant interaction effects 
were observed for several pairings (ankle range-of-motion - step length, ankle 
range-of-motion - step velocity, hip range-of-motion - step velocity), with 
stronger relationships between spatiotemporal and range-of-motion variables as 
age increased.
SIGNIFICANCE: Stronger relationships at both the ankle and hip in older adults 
may suggest that older adults rely more on motion at these joints, and constrain 
other degrees-of-freedom, in an attempt to maintain gait velocity for successful 
task execution and/or safety on the treadmill. This study statistically 
quantifies the effects of age on the relationships between spatiotemporal and 
kinematic domains while accounting for stride-to-stride variations during gait, 
which provides insight into the control of spatiotemporal variables in healthy 
individuals across adulthood, and may inform strategies for identifying gait 
dysfunction with aging.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the intermittent adaptation 
to pelvis perturbation load enhances retention of improved weight transfer and 
generalization of motor skills from treadmill to overground walking, compared 
with effects of the continuous adaptation. Fifteen individuals with incomplete 
SCI participated in two experimental sessions. Each session consisted of (1) 
perturbed treadmill walking with either intermittent (i.e., interspersed 3 
intervals of no perturbation) or continuous (no interval) adaptation to novel 
walking patterns induced by external pelvis perturbation and (2) instrumented 
treadmill walking and overground walking before, immediately, and 10-min post 
perturbed treadmill walking. The external pulling force was applied to the 
pelvis towards the lateral side while the leg touched the treadmill belt. 
Participants showed a retention of improved mediolateral weight transfer 
(P = 0.002) and of enhanced activation of hip abductor (P = 0.016) and calf 
muscles (P < 0.05) in the intermittent condition, whereas the continuous 
condition did not (P ≥ 0.05). After the perturbed treadmill walking practice, 
participants exhibited increased mediolateral weight transfer during overground 
walking (P = 0.04) and enhanced propulsion (P = 0.047) during the instrumented 
treadmill walking for the intermittent condition, whereas the continuous 
condition did not show significant changes (P ≥ 0.13). Further, the intermittent 
condition induced a greater increase in overground walking speed than the 
continuous condition did (P = 0.002). In conclusion, intermittent adaptation to 
the pelvis perturbation load during treadmill walking can promote retention and 
generalization of motor learning for improving walking and balance in people 
with incomplete SCI.

Clinical gait analysis involves objective, valid, and reliable techniques for 
assessing gait function and is crucial for assessing walking patterns and 
identifying gait abnormalities in various patient populations. By analyzing 
joint angles, muscle activity, and other biomechanical factors during walking, 
clinicians can diagnose gait disorders, plan interventions, and improve patient 
outcomes. The GAMMA association aims to provide recommendations to support the 
standardization and quality assurance for clinical-instrumented 3D motion 
analysis services within the German-speaking region in central Europe. The 
practice recommendations described in this paper cover among others (i) 
technical requirements for recording data on level ground and on treadmills, 
(ii) staff management, (iii) recommendations for measurement equipment and 
quality assurance procedures, (iv) patient referral management, (v) practical 
recommendations for data acquisition, management, and reporting, and (vi) 
information to consider when setting up a new gait analysis facility. The GAMMA 
association aspires for these clinical practice guidelines to enhance motion 
analysis services, leading to better and more standardized clinical practices, 
which further contribute to improved patient care, and better conditions for 
research in central Europe.

Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) exhibit a variety of 
sensorimotor deficits which contribute to long-term health risks and lower 
overall health-related quality of life. Recent literature finds abnormal 
cutaneous reflex characteristics and perceptions of instability during gait 
among those with CAI. These may serve as important patient-specific outcome 
measures in diagnosing and monitoring the condition, however, the test-retest 
reliability of these measurements is still undetermined. Therefore, the purpose 
of this study is to assess reliability of cutaneous reflex amplitudes and 
variability and perceived instability following perturbation in those with CAI 
and healthy controls during gait. Subjects walked on a treadmill while receiving 
random, non-noxious sural nerve stimulations throughout the stance phases of 
gait. Muscle activity was measured via electromyography for the peroneus longus, 
and medial and lateral gastrocnemius. Subjects reported their perceived 
instability following each stimulation. Cutaneous reflex amplitudes and 
perceived instability throughout the stance phases of gait can be reliably 
measured within the same day and over a 1-week period while reflex variability 
may be a less reliable measure. Our findings support the use of these variables 
as clinical outcome measures to identify and monitor neuromuscular recovery.

Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) comprise a great variety of medical conditions, 
and the economic and sanitary burdens they cause are a major concern for the 
sanitary systems worldwide. Conventional rehabilitation is effective; however, 
with the rise of new technologies, it can be further improved. Anti-gravity 
treadmills are starting to enter the clinical rehabilitation practice of MSD due 
to their characteristics, which allow weight support while performing walking 
and running exercises. Thus, this systematic review aims to explore the effects 
and use of anti-gravity treadmills in MSD. A systematic search of literature was 
performed by collecting articles from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science on the 
use of anti-gravity treadmills in MSD management. The PEDro scale tool and the 
Joanna Briggs Institute checklist were used to assess the methodological quality 
of the included studies. Relevant data were collected in tables, and the primary 
outcomes were discussed narratively. Of the 185 articles screened, 11 were 
included in the qualitative synthesis. The findings of the selected articles 
encourage the use of anti-gravity treadmills in MSD rehabilitation to improve 
gait functionality, balance, pain relief rct, range of motion, and fracture 
healing. The protocols and outcomes evaluated showed high heterogeneity, and 
quantitative synthesis could not be performed. In conclusion, the anti-gravity 
treadmill proved feasible, safe, and well tolerated by individuals with 
different MSD, and greater improvements were seen in participants who performed 
anti-gravity exercises than in those who performed only conventional 
rehabilitation.

The study of split-belt treadmill adaptation provides insight into the 
priorities determining how we adapt to novel conditions during walking. During 
split-belt adaptation, young adults reduce their metabolic cost and positive leg 
work in part by learning to take longer steps on the fast belt, thus adopting a 
positive step length asymmetry. However, aging may lead to a shift in the work 
performed by distal versus proximal joints, so it is unknown if older adults can 
similarly reduce the work performed by the legs during split-belt walking. 
Therefore, we quantified the relationship between joint work rate and step 
length asymmetry when fourteen older adults walked on a split-belt treadmill. We 
hypothesized that total positive joint work would decrease at more positive step 
length asymmetries and that more positive asymmetries would be associated with a 
reduction in positive ankle joint work on the fast belt. We found that step 
length asymmetry was negatively correlated with total positive work (p = 0.01) 
and that changes in positive joint work were primarily driven by positive ankle 
work on the fast belt (p = 0.01). Since ankle musculature is hypothesized to be 
a major contributor to metabolic cost during gait, reductions in ankle joint 
work likely contribute to the reduction in metabolic cost observed in other 
studies of split-belt walking. These results demonstrate that healthy aging 
still allows individuals to take advantage of the work performed by the 
treadmill to reduce the mechanical energy cost of walking.

Changes in interlimb coordination induced by within-stride changes in treadmill 
speed.

Hall BL, Roemmich RT, Banks CL.

During walking, interlimb coordination involves the right and left legs working 
together to achieve a desired movement. Previously, dynamic treadmill walking 
has been shown to drive asymmetric gait changes in healthy young adults through 
selectively changing the speed of the whole treadmill. Currently, the 
coordination demands of this novel walking environment are unknown and must be 
understood prior to assessing dynamic treadmill walking in clinical populations. 
We investigated the interlimb coordination requirements of dynamic treadmill 
walking in ten healthy young adults. We quantified interlimb coordination 
changes as phase shift (timing of maximum cross-correlation between limb angle 
trajectories of the left and right legs), center of oscillation (limb angle at 
midstance), and center of oscillation difference (oscillation angle difference 
between legs). We found that phase shift in the Fast trial (i.e., 1.0m/s 
treadmill speed in first 50% of gait cycle, 0.5m/s in latter 50%) was 
significantly more positive (i.e., the right leg oscillates ahead of the left 
leg in time) than in the Slow, Accelerate, and Decelerate trials (all p<0.01). 
The Fast trial produced significantly positive center of oscillation values on 
the right leg, indicating that the right leg is oscillating about a more flexed 
axis than the left. Center of oscillation difference was similarly more positive 
during the Fast trial than in the Decelerate (p<0.01) and Slow (p<0.01) trials. 
These results exemplify that some forms of dynamic treadmill walking change 
interlimb coordination to a greater extent than others. After several minutes of 
dynamic treadmill walking, interlimb coordination is changed relative to 
baseline walking in the spatial domain (Fast and Decelerate conditions) and the 
temporal domain (Fast and Slow). Therefore, dynamic treadmill walking is tunable 
in both biomechanical and interlimb coordination parameters, creating a variety 
of options for restoring gait symmetry in asymmetric populations.

Older adults are at an increased risk of developing knee osteoarthritis. High 
internal knee abduction moment during daily activities may elevate the risk of 
knee osteoarthritis. Incline walking exercise has been found to decrease knee 
abduction moment in healthy young adults. However, it is unknown if this occurs 
in healthy older adults. The purpose of this study was to quantify the internal 
knee abduction moment at different treadmill grades to determine if incline 
walking could reduce the knee abduction moment in healthy older adults. Twelve 
healthy older adult males walked on a treadmill at five incline grades (0%, 5%, 
10%, 15%, and 20%) at 1.34 ​m⋅s-1. The primary outcome variable was the internal 
knee abduction moment. A one-way repeated measures multivariate analysis of 
variance was performed to determine differences in the dependent variables among 
incline gradients. Peak knee abduction moment significantly decreased from level 
walking at all gradients in 10% increments (0%-10%, p ​< ​0.001; 5%-15%, 
p ​< ​0.002; and 10%-20%, p ​= ​0.04). A reduction in knee abduction moment 
during incline walking could result in decreased knee joint loading on the 
medial knee compartment. For older adults, who are looking to exercise to 
improve their health, incline walking may be beneficial to promote lower body 
strength and cardiovascular ability without inflicting further harm to the aging 
knee joints. However, because the frontal plane knee joint was of primary 
interest in this study, further research is needed to determine the effects of 
incline walking on other joints and in other planes of motion.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline impairs communications between the brain and the 
sensory systems but also alters gait, which explains why demented patients 
exhibit an increased risk of falling. Since cognition processes and gait control 
share a common neural network, cognitive loading has been shown to induce the 
same brain activity in healthy subjects as in demented patients.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Our overarching goal is to develop clinical methods based on 
gait variability to detect cognitive decline. Our main hypothesis is that gait 
variability discriminates between different cognitive loads applied to healthy 
younger subjects.
METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects walked on an instrumented treadmill at a 
self-selected pace for three-minutes under different levels of cognitive 
loadings (none, low and high). These loadings were applied by requesting the 
subjects to perform specific arithmetic operations while walking. Variability of 
eight parameters were quantified over 340 steps using coefficients of variation.
RESULTS: The variability of three of these eight parameters showed significant 
differences between different cognitive loads: center of pressure displacement 
in the ML direction and peak pressure under the heel and toe.
SIGNIFICANCE: These parameters can be measured using simple pressure insoles, 
thus enabling clinical use for early detection of dementia.

Mental fatigue can affect cognitive function and interfere with motor 
performance. We examined if mental fatigue affected gait through age-specific 
modulation of wavelet-based time-frequency intermuscular beta-band coherence in 
muscles while walking on a treadmill at 1.2 m·s-1. The Psychomotor Vigilance 
Task, and the AX-Continuous Performance and the Stroop tests were used to induce 
mental fatigue in groups of healthy young and older participants. Mental fatigue 
reduced stance time, stride length, and marginally step width and increased 
cadence, stride length and stance time variability. In older compared with young 
participants before the induction of mental fatigue, wavelet-based 
time-frequency intermuscular beta-band coherence measured during walking was 
lower in the tibialis-peroneus and tibialis-gastrocnemius muscle pairs in 
specific phases of the gait cycle. In both age groups, after induction of mental 
fatigue, selected clusters of wavelet-based time-frequency intermuscular 
beta-band coherence measured during walking increased in the 
biceps-semitendinosus, rectus-vastus, tibialis-peroneus, gastrocnemius-soleus, 
and tibialis-gastrocnemius muscle pairs. In conclusion, we observed that while 
old age might weaken oscillatory coupling between selected ankle muscle pairs

INTRODUCTION: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic condition 
characterised by stenosis or occlusion of the arteries in the lower limbs. 
Patients with PAD commonly report intermittent claudication (leg 
pain/discomfort) during physical activities, which significantly limits the 
ability to walk and perform activities of daily living. Supervised exercise 
training is an effective therapy that can improve walking capacity in people 
with PAD. Emerging evidence also suggests that supervised exercise therapy 
following lower limb revascularisation can further enhance walking capacity when 
compared with revascularisation alone. However, access to dedicated exercise 
programmes for patients with PAD is limited in most countries, and there is a 
need to test the efficacy of alternative rehabilitation strategies and referral 
pathways. This randomised-controlled study aims to assess the efficacy of a 
cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) programme versus usual care on walking 
capacity and quality of life in patients who have undergone lower limb 
revascularisation for PAD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a single-centre, prospective, parallel group, 
randomised-controlled trial. Sixty-six participants who have undergone a lower 
limb revascularisation procedure for PAD, in the previous 12 months, will be 
randomly allocated to a CR programme or a usual care (control) group. The CR 
programme will include two supervised exercise sessions per week for 6 weeks 
primarily consisting of intermittent treadmill walking at a moderate exercise 
intensity and home-based walking advice. During the 6-week programme, 
participants will also attend one education seminar (5.5 hours) which will cover 
topics such as diet, medications, exercise training and lifestyle modifications 
for the management of cardiovascular diseases. The control group will receive 
usual care and medical advice from their local doctor and vascular surgeon. The 
primary outcome will be 6-min walk distance. Secondary outcomes include 
pain-free walking distance during the six-minute walk test, maximal and 
pain-free walking time during a graded treadmill walking test, cardiorespiratory 
fitness, self-reported walking capacity, disease-specific quality of life, and 
self-reported and objectively measured physical activity levels. Exploratory 
outcomes include brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, arterial stiffness, 
ankle-brachial blood pressure index and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease 
risk. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (week 1), following the CR/usual 
care period (week 8) and again at 6-month follow-up (week 34).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received ethics approval from the Human 
Research Ethics Committees of Queensland Health Metro North Hospital and Health 
Service (94155) and the University of the Sunshine Coast (S231914). Findings 
from this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and through 
national and international conference presentations.

Devices for functional resistance training (FRT) during walking are often 
configured to resist the knee or both the hip and knee joints. Adding resistance 
to the hip in addition to the knee should alter the effects of training; 
however, these configurations have not been directly compared. We examined how 
FRT during walking differs during the knee or hip and knee conditions. Fourteen 
non-disabled individuals received FRT during treadmill walking with a device 
configured to provide a viscous resistance to the knee or the hip and knee 
during separate visits. Between these configurations, we compared gait kinetics, 
muscle activation, kinematic aftereffects, peripheral fatigue, and corticospinal 
excitability. Adding resistance to the hip increased hip flexion moment and 
concentric power during the swing phase. However, this did not result in 
significant differences in muscle activation, aftereffects, peripheral fatigue, 
or corticospinal excitability between the configurations. Instead, both 
configurations produced similar changes in these variables. These results 
indicate that, aside from kinetics, walking with resistance at the hip and knee 
was not different from resisting the knee in the acute setting. However, further 
research is needed to determine if long-term training with resistance at the hip 
induces differential effects than resisting the knee alone.

BACKGROUND: The Sensory Organization Test condition 5 (SOT5) assesses an 
astronaut's vestibular function pre-/post-spaceflight but has a ceiling effect 
and mainly evaluates standing balance, neglecting the challenges of walking 
during space missions. A Locomotor Sensory Organization Test (LSOT) has been 
developed, mirroring the SOT concept but tailored to assess vestibular function 
during walking. This study aims to advance current knowledge by examining 
changes in ground reaction force (GRF) during normal walking (LSOT1) and walking 
in LSOT5 (vision blocked and treadmill speed varied), both with and without 
mastoid vibrations.
METHODS: Sixty healthy adults were recruited and divided into two groups: one 
with mastoid vibration and one without. GRF peaks and respective variabilities 
were analyzed in the vertical (V), anterior-posterior (AP), and medial-lateral 
(ML) directions during stance cycles. The effects of LSOTs and mastoid vibration 
on each dependent variable were assessed using Friedman's two-way analysis of 
variance by ranks.
RESULTS: The findings revealed that:1) Walking in LSOT5 increased the 
variabilities of GRFs regardless of the administration of mastoid vibration; 2) 
the application of mastoid vibration reduced the amplitude of GRF peaks; and 3) 
walking in LSOT5 while receiving mastoid vibration was the most challenging task 
compared to all other tasks in this study.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that analyzing GRF can detect changes in the 
strategy of balance control across different sensory-conflicted conditions. The 
findings could be beneficial for assessing the vestibular function pre- and 
post-space missions and planning for future sensorimotor training programs aimed 
at enhancing astronauts' abilities to navigate unpredictable sensory-conflicted 
conditions.

Bipedal locomotion requires body adaptation to maintain stability after 
encountering a transition to incline walking. A major part of this adaptation is 
reflected by adjusting walking speed. When transitioning to uphill walking, 
people exert more energy to counteract gravitational forces pulling them 
backward, while when transitioning to downhill walking people break to avoid 
uncontrolled acceleration. These behaviors are affected by body-based 
(proprioception and vestibular) cues as well as by visual cues. Since older age 
adversely affects walking, it is unclear whether older adults rely on vision 
during locomotion in a similar manner to younger individuals. In this study, we 
tested whether the influence of visual cues on these walking speed modulations 
in healthy older adults (60-75 years old, N = 15) were comparable to those found 
in healthy young adults (20-40 years old, N = 12). Using a fully immersive 
virtual-reality system embedded with a self-paced treadmill and projected visual 
scene, we manipulated the inclinations of both the treadmill and the visual 
scene in an independent manner, and measured participants walking speed. In 
addition, we also measured individual visual field dependency using the rod and 
frame test. The older adults presented the expected braking (decelerating) and 
exertion (accelerating) effects, in response to downhill and uphill visual 
illusions, respectively, in a similar manner to the young group. Furthermore, we 
found a significant correlation between the magnitude of walking speed 
modulation and visual field dependency in each of the groups with significantly 
higher visual field dependency in older adults. These results suggest that with 
aging individuals maintain their reliance on the visual system to modulate their 
gait in accordance with surface inclination in a manner similar to that of 
younger adults.

BACKGROUND: Treadmill based Robotic-Assisted Gait Training (t-RAGT) provides for 
automated locomotor training to help the patient achieve a physiological gait 
pattern, reducing the physical effort required by therapist. By introducing the 
robot as a third agent to the traditional one-to-one physiotherapist-patient 
(Pht-Pt) relationship, the therapist might not be fully aware of the patient's 
motor performance. This gap has been bridged by the integration in 
rehabilitation robots of a visual FeedBack (FB) that informs about patient's 
performance. Despite the recognized importance of FB in t-RAGT, the optimal role 
of the therapist in the complex patient-robot interaction is still unclear. This 
study aimed to describe whether the type of FB combined with different 
modalities of Pht's interaction toward Pt would affect the patients' visual 
attention and emotional engagement during t-RAGT.
METHODS: Ten individuals with incomplete Spinal Cord Injury (C or D ASIA 
Impairment Scale level) were assessed using eye-tracking (ET) and high-density 
EEG during seven t-RAGT sessions with Lokomat where (i) three types of visual FB 
(chart, emoticon and game) and (ii) three levels of Pht-Pt interaction (low, 
medium and high) were randomly combined. ET metrics (fixations and saccades) 
were extracted for each of the three defined areas of interest (AoI) (monitor, 
Pht and surrounding) and compared among the different experimental conditions 
(FB, Pht-Pt interaction level). The EEG spectral activations in theta and alpha 
bands were reconstructed for each FB type applying Welch periodogram to data 
localised in the whole grey matter volume using sLORETA.
RESULTS: We found an effect of FB type factor on all the ET metrics computed in 
the three AoIs while the factor Pht-Pt interaction level also combined with FB 
type showed an effect only on the ET metrics calculated in Pht and surrounding 
AoIs. Neural activation in brain regions crucial for social cognition resulted 
for high Pht-Pt interaction level, while activation of the insula was found 
during low interaction, independently on the FB used.
CONCLUSIONS: The type of FB and the way in which Pht supports the patients both 
have a strong impact on patients' engagement and should be considered in the 
design of a t-RAGT-based rehabilitation session.

Effect of recording angle on accuracy of Kinovea-based kinematic gait analysis 
compared to three-dimensional motion analysis in healthy dogs: optimal at 90° 
recording angle.

Winkler EV, Lauer SK, Steigmeier-Raith SI, Zablotski Y, Mille MA.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of recording 
angle on the accuracy of 2-D Kinovea-based kinematic motion analysis (KMA) 
compared to 3-D KMA in dogs.
METHODS: In this prospective study, 3-D marker-based KMA (VICON-Nexus, version 
2.12.1, and Procalc, version 1.6; VICON Motion Systems Ltd) was performed on 
healthy dogs (body weight ≥ 20 kg) walking on a treadmill (study period: 
November 2022). Simultaneously, dogs were video-recorded by 3 smartphones 
(iPhone SE; Apple Inc) at 1.50 m distance and 45°, 90°, and 135° recording 
angles relative to the shoulder for Kinovea-based, angle-calibrated KMA. 
Shoulder, elbow, carpal, hip, stifle, and tarsal joint kinematics were 
calculated for 3 synchronized gait cycles. Each gait cycle was divided into 10 
increments. The estimated difference between 3-D KMA and Kinovea was assessed 
using robust linear mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: 34 dogs were included. Differences of less than 5° between methods were 
considered reasonable. At a 45° recording angle, the estimated joint angle 
difference was < 5° for the carpus and hip during ≥ 5 of 10 gait cycle 
increments. At 90°, the difference was < 5° across all joints for ≥ 9 of 10 
increments and at 135° was < 5° for the elbow, carpus, and hip for ≥ 7 of 10 
increments.
CONCLUSIONS: Kinovea-based kinematics were most accurate when recorded at 90°. 
At 45°, Kinovea provided accurate data for the carpus and hip and at 135° for 
the elbow, carpus, and hip.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: While angle-calibrated kinematic measurements can be 
accurate when using Kinovea for canine KMA, a 90° recording angle is preferable.

INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 may result in the development of new symptoms, known 
as long COVID, a few months after the original infection.
PURPOSE: It is elusive to what extent physical capacity in patients diagnosed 
with long COVID is impacted.
METHODS: We compared maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max), one of the single most 
important factors for cardiovascular health and mortality, expired lung volumes 
and air flow, oxygen cost of walking and 6-min-walking-test (6MWT), in 20 
patients diagnosed with long COVID (11 males and 9 females; 44 ± 16 years (SD); 
26.7 ± 3.8BMI, duration of acute phase 1.7 ± 1.2 weeks, tested 4 ± 3 months 
after long COVID diagnosis) with 20 healthy age and sex matched controls 
(11 males and 9 females; 44 ± 16 years; 25.9 ± 4.0BMI).
RESULTS: Long COVID patients had a V̇O2max of 41.4 ± 16.2 mL∙kg-1∙min-1(men) and 
38.2 ± 7.5 (women) and this was not different from controls. Similarly, mean 
spirometry measures in the patient group (VC; FVC; FEV1; FEV1/FVC) were also not 
different (85-106%) from predicted healthy values. Finally, inclined treadmill 
(5%, 4 km∙h-1) walking economy was not different between the groups (long COVID: 
15.2 ± 1.1 mL∙kg-1∙min-1; controls: 15.2 ± 1.2 mL∙kg-1∙min-1), while the 6MWT 
revealed a difference (long COVID: 606 ± 118 m; controls: 685 ± 85 m; 
p = 0.036).
CONCLUSION: V̇O2max, oxygen cost of walking, and spirometry measurements did not 
appear to be impaired in patients diagnosed with long COVID with a prior mild to 
moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. The typical outcomes in these essential factors 
for health and longevity implies that while long COVID can present with a range 
of symptoms, caution should be made when attributing these symptoms directly to 
compromised pulmonary function or V̇O2max.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the effectiveness of exercise training during 
pregnancy on peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak), cardiac function and flow-mediated 
dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery throughout pregnancy and post partum in 
individuals with a prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) ≥28 kg/m2.
TRIAL DESIGN: Parallel-group randomised controlled trial (RCT).
METHODS: The exercise group in the Exercise Training in Pregnancy (ETIP) RCT was 
offered 3 weekly supervised exercise sessions comprising 35 min of 
moderate-intensity treadmill walking followed by 25 min of strength exercises. 
The intervention started in gestational weeks 12-18 and continued throughout 
pregnancy. We measured V̇O2peak and FMD at baseline, in gestational weeks 34-37 
and 3 months post partum and offered echocardiography in gestational weeks 14, 
20, and 32, and 6-8 weeks postpartum.
RESULTS: Of the 91 participants included in ETIP, 87 participants (age: 31.3±4.2 
years, BMI: 34.6±4.3 kg/m2) provided data on V̇O2peak, cardiac function and/or 
FMD. There was no statistically significant effect of exercise training on 
V̇O2peak in gestational weeks 34-37, with an estimated effect of 1.7 mL/min/kg 
(95% CI -0.4 to 3.7, p=0.112) or post partum (1.6 mL/min/kg, 95% CI -0.2 to 3.4, 
p=0.079), compared with the control group. There were no statistically 
significant between-group differences in either FMD or any of the 
echocardiographic outcomes. Only 50% of the participants in the exercise group 
fulfilled our prespecified adherence criteria.
CONCLUSION: Offering pregnant individuals with BMI ≥28 kg/m2, a supervised 
exercise intervention did not improve cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiac 
function or FMD.

PURPOSE: The aim of the current study was to determine whether gait control 
(muscle synergies) or gait stability (margin of stability (MoS)) were different 
between younger and older adults when walking on level or downhill slopes. 
Further, it sought to determine associations between either age or physical 
activity with muscle synergy widths.
METHODS: Ten healthy younger (28.1 ± 8.0 years) and ten healthy older 
(69.5 ± 6.3 years) adults walked at their preferred walking speed on a treadmill 
at different slopes (0˚, - 4˚ and - 8˚). Muscle synergies were extracted using 
non-negative matrix factorisation and compared between groups and walking 
slopes. Correlations between the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the 
synergies' activations and weekly recreational physical activity minutes and age 
were also determined.
RESULTS: Younger and older adults both walked with similar muscle synergies 
across all tested slopes, with 4 synergies accounting for > 85% variance of 
overall muscle activity in both groups across all tested slopes, with high 
scalar products (≥ 0.86) for each synergy and slope. It was also demonstrated 
that physical activity and age had different associations with pooled muscle 
synergies across slopes, as weekly minutes spent in recreational physical 
activity were associated with the FWHM of a synergy activated at weight 
acceptance, whereas age was associated with the FWHM of synergies occurring at 
push off and foot clearance, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that healthy older and younger adults walk with 
similar muscle synergies on downhill slopes, and that physical activity and age 
influence different muscle synergies during walking.

BACKGROUND: Individualizing interventions is imperative to optimize physical 
activity in people with chronic stroke. This secondary analysis grouped 
individuals with chronic stroke into clinical profiles based on baseline 
characteristics and examined if these clinical profiles preferentially 
benefitted from a specific rehabilitation intervention to improve daily 
step-activity.
METHODS: Participants had non-cerebellar strokes ≥6 months prior to enrollment, 
were 21-85 years old, had walking speeds of 0.3-1.0 m/s, and took <8,000 
steps-per-day. Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 interventions: 
high-intensity treadmill training (FAST), a step-activity behavioral 
intervention (SAM), or a combined intervention (FAST+SAM). The primary outcome 
was the interaction of latent class (clinical profile) and intervention group 
(FAST, SAM, FAST+SAM) on a change in steps-per-day. Key clinical characteristics 
to identify the latent classes included walking speed, walking endurance, 
balance self-efficacy, cognition, and area deprivation.
RESULTS: Of the 190 participants with complete pre- and post-intervention data 
(mean [SD] age, 64 [12] years; 93 females [48.9%]), 3 distinct profiles of 
people with chronic stroke were identified. Within our sample, class 1 had the 
lowest walking capacity (speed and endurance), lowest balance self-efficacy, and 
highest area deprivation, and had the greatest change in step-activity when 
enrolled in the SAM (mean[95%CI], 1624 [426 - 2821]) or FAST+SAM (1150 [723 - 
1577]) intervention. Class 2 had walking capacity, baseline steps-per-day, and 
self-efficacy values between Class 1 and 3, and had the greatest change in 
step-activity when enrolled in the SAM (2002 [1193-2811]) intervention. Class 3 
had the highest walking capacity, highest self-efficacy, and lowest area 
deprivation and the greatest change in step-activity when enrolled in the 
FAST+SAM (1532 [915-2150]) intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: People with chronic stroke require different interventions to 
optimize a change in step-activity. Clinicians can use clinically relevant 
measures to personalize intervention selection to augment step-activity in 
people with chronic stroke.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate how people post-stroke and healthy people experience 
the addition of semi-immersive virtual reality (VR) and optic flow speed 
manipulation while walking on a treadmill, and if optic flow speed manipulation 
could be used in rehabilitation to elicit changes in post-stroke gait 
biomechanics.
METHODS: Sixteen people post-stroke and 16 healthy controls walked on a 
self-paced treadmill. After 2 habituation trials (without and with VR), 
participants walked 3 more trials under the following conditions of optic flow: 
matched, slow, and fast. Primary outcome measures were spatiotemporal gait 
parameters and lower limb kinematics. Secondary outcomes (simulator sickness and 
enjoyment) were assessed with the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and 
visual analogue scales (VAS).
RESULTS: VR did not influence the gait biomechanics, and optic flow manipulation 
had a limited effect. Both groups significantly increased their walking speed 
with the slow optic flow and decreased their speed with the fast optic flow. For 
the other gait parameters, only small changes were found. Only people 
post-stroke had a significant increase on the SSQ and the enjoyment-VAS.
CONCLUSION: Adding semi-immersive VR did not influence the gait pattern, was 
well tolerated, and enjoyable. Both groups altered their gait parameters when 
the optic flow speed was adjusted during the protocol. Incorporating such 
manipulations into treadmill training is feasible, but further research about 
the type of manipulation and level of immersion is needed.

Human locomotion contains innate variability which may provide health insights. 
Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has been used to quantify the temporal 
structure of variability for treadmill running, although it has been less 
commonly applied to uncontrolled overground running. This study aimed to 
determine how running gait complexity changes in response to gradient and 
elapsed exercise duration during uncontrolled overground running. Sixty-eight 
participants completed an overground, mass-participation five-kilometre run (a 
parkrun). Stride times were recorded using an inertial measurement unit mounted 
on the distal shank. Data were divided into four consecutive intervals (uphill 
lap 1, downhill lap 1, uphill lap 2, downhill lap 2). The magnitude (SD) and 
structure (DFA) of stride time variability were compared across elapsed exercise 
duration and gradient using a repeated-measures ANOVA. Participants maintained 
consistent stride times throughout the run. Stride time DFA-α displayed a 
moderate decrease (d = |0.39| ± 0.13) during downhill running compared to uphill 
running. DFA-α did not change in response to elapsed exercise duration, although 
a greater stride time SD was found during the first section of lap 1 (d = |0.30| 
± 0.12). These findings suggest that inter- and intra-run changes in gait 
complexity should be interpreted in the context of course elevation profiles 
before conclusions on human health are drawn.

BACKGROUND: Although supervised exercise therapy (SET) is a primary treatment 
for peripheral artery disease (PAD), the current literature is limited regarding 
the mechanisms contributing to increased walking distances, including how lower 
extremity muscle function is altered after SET. This study aimed to investigate 
the effects of SET on lower extremity muscle function during walking in patients 
with PAD.
METHODS: Twelve patients with PAD participated in a 6-month SET program 
consisting of three weekly exercise sessions (a total of 72 sessions) and 
adhered to the American College of Sports Medicine's (ACSM) recommendations. 
Each session started with a 5 min warm-up of mild walking and static stretching 
of upper and lower body muscles, followed by 50 min of intermitted exercise on a 
treadmill, and then finished with 5 min of cool-down activities similar to the 
warm-up. Each patient walked across a 10 m pathway with reflective markers on 
their lower limbs twice: before (baseline) and after six months of participation 
in SET (post-exercise). Marker coordinates and ground reaction forces were 
recorded and imported to OpenSim software (version 4.0) for gait simulations. 
Muscle force, muscle power, and metabolic rate were estimated from OpenSim and 
compared between the baseline and post-exercise.
RESULTS: The mean plantar flexor force was not altered after SET. However, 
individuals' plantar flexor muscles demonstrated improvements in force 
production (lateral gastrocnemius: 75-80% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.43; 
medial gastrocnemius: 65-85% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.71; soleus: 90-95% of 
stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.26). Furthermore, plantar flexor power increased 
(80-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.39) and this was attributed to increased 
power in the lateral gastrocnemius (80-85% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.47), 
medial gastrocnemius (80-90% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.22-0.60), and soleus 
muscles (85-95% of stance, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.49). Similarly, other muscle 
groups (knee extensors, knee flexors, hip abductors, hip adductors, hip 
extensors, and hip flexors) also exhibited force and power increases after SET. 
Additionally, force and power variances were significantly decreased in several 
muscle groups (plantar flexors, knee extensors, hip abductors, hip external 
rotators, hip extensors, and hip flexors). Total metabolic rate also increased 
during the stance period where muscle force and power were elevated after SET 
(early stance: 5-25%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.82; mid stance: 35-45%, Cohen's d = 
0.20-0.47; late stance: 75-80%, Cohen's d = 0.20-0.36).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that from a biomechanics perspective, muscle 
functions during walking are improved in patients with PAD after SET; however, 
the improvements were generally small and were not reflected by all muscle 
groups.

Background/Objectives:Porphyromonas gingivalis infection has been associated 
with various systemic diseases and may cause delayed healing of muscle injury. 
However, the relationship between muscle injury healing and P. gingivalis 
infection remains unclear. Our hypothesis was that P. gingivalis infection 
delays the healing of muscle injuries. Methods: Fifty-six 8-week-old male Wistar 
rats were randomly divided into two groups: sonicated P. gingivalis was 
intraperitoneally administered in one group (PG group), whereas saline was 
administered in the other group (CO group). Skeletal muscle injury was induced 
via cardiotoxin injections in all animals. The cross-sectional area of 
regenerating muscle cells was evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin staining, and the 
degree of muscle fibrosis was evaluated by Masson's trichrome staining. The 
expression of paired box protein (Pax7) and myoblast determination protein 
(MyoD) and the identified stages of myocyte regeneration were analysed by 
immunohistochemical staining. Motion analysis was performed during walking. 
Results: The cross-sectional area of muscle cells was significantly smaller in 
the PG group on days 7 and 14 post-injury than in the CO group. The Pax7+/MyoD- 
ratio was significantly lower in the PG group on day 1 post-injury than in the 
CO group. Motion analysis of treadmill walking showed that the PG group had a 
lower minimum calcaneal height on days 3 and 7 post-injury than the CO group. 
Conclusions: This study suggests that administration of sonicated P. gingivalis 
in rats can delay the healing process of muscle injury. Further research is 
needed to understand this mechanism of delay of P. gingivalis.

Technology, New Taipei 243303, Taiwan.

Background/Objectives: Despite the increasing prevalence of smartphone use while 
walking, few studies have comprehensively investigated head and neck posture in 
real-world settings. This study employed a single-blind observation of 
smartphone users walking in public areas of Taipei, Taiwan, to examine head and 
neck movements, with a particular focus on the effects of gender and 
hand-operation type. Methods: We conducted observations of 120 smartphone users 
(60 males and 60 females), recording neck flexion (NF), head flexion (HF), gaze 
angle (GA), and viewing distance (VD) in the sagittal plane during walking. The 
analysis included four combinations of gender and smartphone hand operation 
(one-handed and two-handed use). Results: Significant gender differences were 
found in NF (p < 0.001), GA (p < 0.01), and VD (p < 0.01), with males exhibiting 
greater NF, GA, and VD than females. HF was similar between genders, but males' 
larger NF suggested a more pronounced forward head posture, potentially 
increasing neck and shoulder strain. Hand operations also significantly affected 
VD (p < 0.001). Most users displayed a GA exceeding 60°, possibly an involuntary 
adjustment for better visibility of the walking path, potentially increasing 
eyestrain. Conclusions: Previous studies have primarily simulated smartphone use 
while walking in controlled environments, such as on treadmills or in 
laboratories. In contrast, our single-blind field study highlights the 
real-world risks associated with smartphone use during walking, including neck 
and shoulder strain and eyestrain, with notable differences observed between 
genders.

A type-2 fuzzy inference-based approach enables walking speed estimation that 
adapts to inter-individual gait patterns.

Shanghai for Science and Technology , Shanghai, China.

OBJECTIVES: Individuals change walking speed by regulating step frequency (SF), 
stride length (SL), or a combination of both (FL combinations). However, 
existing methods of walking speed estimation ignore this regulatory mechanism. 
This paper aims to achieve accurate walking speed estimation while enabling 
adaptation to inter-individual speed regulation strategies.
METHODS: We first extracted thigh features closely related to individual speed 
regulation based on a single thigh mounted IMU. Next, an interval type-2 fuzzy 
inference system was used to infer and quantify the individuals' speed 
regulation intentions, enabling speed estimation independent of inter-individual 
gait patterns. Experiments with five subjects walking on a treadmill at 
different speeds and with different gait patterns validated our method.
RESULTS: The overall root mean square error (RMSE) for speed estimation was 
0.0704 ± 0.0087 m/s, and the RMSE for different gait patterns was no more than 
0.074 ± 0.005 m/s.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method provides high-accuracy speed estimation. 
Moreover, our method can be adapted to different FL combinations without the 
need for individualised tuning or training of individuals with varying limb 
lengths and gait habits. We anticipate that the proposed method will help 
provide more intuitive speed adaptive control for rehabilitation robots, 
especially intelligent lower limb prostheses.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Accumulating evidence supports the effectiveness of 
moderate-intensity aerobic training on metabolic health, with limited studies 
investigating change in resting substrate oxidation. The aim of this study was 
to explore whether 10 weeks of walking-based aerobic training would alter 
substrate oxidation in postmenopausal women with obesity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-four postmenopausal women with obesity who were 
assigned into the control (n = 12) or exercise groups (n = 12) undertook a 
10-week aerobic training program (3 d·week-1) that involved walking exercises at 
50-70% of heart rate reserve on a treadmill, with exercise volume increased from 
25 to 40 min·day-1. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and body composition were 
measured pre- and post-training. Whole-body substrate oxidation was calculated 
using respiratory data collected during RMR measurement via indirect 
calorimetry. No significant change was noted (p > 0.05) in resting fat oxidation 
and carbohydrate oxidation in the exercise group. Resting respiratory exchange 
ratio and RMR did not alter in response to the training program (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results show that a 10-week of moderate-intensity aerobic 
training does not modify substrate oxidation in postmenopausal women with 
obesity.

The aim of this study was to compare the warm-up effects of a treadmill walking 
warm-up (TW) with a dynamic warm-up (DW) on the responses to cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing (CPET) in youth. A sample of 16 active youth (age 13.6 ± 1.8 
yr) were tested for peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) using the Fitkids treadmill 
test protocol on 2 nonconsecutive days following different 6-min warm-up 
procedures. The TW consisted of walking on a treadmill at 2.2 mph and 0% grade 
whereas the DW consisted of 12 bodyweight exercises with a 2 kg medicine ball. 
Maximal heart rate (HR) was significantly higher following DW vs TW (200.8 ± 
6.16 vs. 197.9 ± 7.3 bpm, respectively; p < 0.05), whereas no significant 
differences were found between DW and TW for VO2 peak (50.5 ± 9.9 vs 50.6 ± 11.1 
ml/kg/min), maximal minute ventilation (VE; 93.0 ±21.4 vs. 92.7 ±21.2 L/min), 
maximal respiratory exchange ratio (1.19 ± 0.08 vs 1.22 ± 0.08), and total 
exercise test time (668.1 ± 103.5 vs 686.3 ± 97.0 s), respectively. During the 
Fitkids treadmill test protocol HR and VE were significantly higher following DW 
vs TW at stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 and stage 4, and oxygen uptake was 
significantly higher following DW vs TW during stage 1 (all p < 0.05). Findings 
indicate a DW elicits a higher maximal HR and higher submaximal HR, VE, and 
oxygen uptake values than TW during CPET in youth, although no differences in 
VO2 peak were observed.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic condition that impairs 
blood flow to the lower extremities, resulting in myopathy in affected skeletal 
muscles. Improving our understanding of PAD and developing novel treatment 
strategies necessitates a comprehensive examination of cellular structural 
alterations that occur in the muscles with disease progression. Here we aimed to 
employ electron microscopy to quantify skeletal muscle ultrastructural 
alterations responsible for the myopathy of PAD. Fifty-two participants (22 
controls, 10 PAD Stage II, and 20 PAD Stage IV) were enrolled. Gastrocnemius 
biopsies were obtained to determine mitochondrial respiration and oxidative 
stress. Skeletal muscle sarcomere, mitochondria, lipid droplets, and sarcoplasm 
were assessed using transmission electron microscopy and focused ion beam 
scanning electron microscopy. Controls and PAD Stage II patients underwent 
walking performance tests: 6-minute walking test, 4-minute walking velocity, and 
maximum graded treadmill test. We identified several prominent ultrastructural 
modifications in PAD gastrocnemius, including reduced sarcomere dimensions, 
alterations in mitochondria number and localization, myofibrillar 
disorientation, changes in lipid droplets, and modifications in 
mitochondria-lipid droplet contact area. These changes correlated with impaired 
mitochondrial respiration and increased ROS production. We observed progressive 
deterioration in mitochondrial parameters across PAD stages. Stage II PAD showed 
impaired mitochondrial function and structure, while stage IV exhibited further 
deterioration, more pronounced structural alterations, and a decrease in 
mitochondrial content. The walking performance of Stage II PAD patients was 
significantly reduced. Our findings suggest that pathological mitochondria play 
a key role in the skeletal muscle dysfunction of PAD patients and represent an 
important target for therapeutic interventions aimed at improving clinical and 
functional outcomes in this patient population. Our data indicate that 
treatments should be implemented early and may include therapies designed to 
preserve and enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, optimize 
mitochondrial-lipid droplet interactions, or mitigate oxidative stress. 
Translational Perspective: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterized by 
skeletal muscle and mitochondrial dysfunction. Ultrastructural changes in 
skeletal muscle myofibers and mitochondria morphology can provide significant 
information on the PAD pathophysiology. Here, we investigated skeletal muscle 
and mitochondria morphological and functional changes at the sarcomere level and 
across the disease progression and have found that sarcomere lengths and 
mitochondria count and function are associated with disease progression, 
indicating loss of skeletal muscle contractile and metabolic function. 
Ultrastructural changes in the PAD skeletal muscle can provide significant 
information in the development of new treatments.

Rationale: In the United States, ambulatory oxygen is recommended for patients 
with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) who experience symptomatic exertional hypoxemia. Ambulatory 
oxygen need is often determined by submaximal hall walk testing; however, this 
may fail to accurately characterize exertional hypoxemia in some patients. 
Objectives: Assess for differences in ambulatory oxygen needs between patients 
with IPF and COPD who completed a ramped treadmill protocol exercise test 
(RTPET) and correlate oxygen flow rates determined at highest-level (HL) 
exertion with lung function and exercise parameters. Oxygen need is defined as 
the flow rate needed to maintain oxygen saturation ⩾90% in patients who 
desaturate to ⩽88%. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of RTPET 
results for patients with IPF and COPD who also recently completed spirometry. 
The RTPET has three phases: rest, submaximal usual pace (UP) walking at 0% 
treadmill grade for 3 minutes, and HL walking at the UP walk speed with 
increasing treadmill grade by 2% every 2 minutes. Patients with IPF were part of 
a clinical registry, whereas patients with COPD were identified based on 
diagnosis coding and spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital 
capacity < 0.70). The RTPET for both groups was completed based on a 
pulmonologist's referral. Results: We included 329 patients with IPF and 2,343 
patients with COPD. A greater proportion of patients with IPF required 
ambulatory oxygen to maintain saturation ⩾90% at HL exertion. After adjusting 
for demographic covariates and exercise parameters, patients with IPF required 
higher ambulatory oxygen flow rates than subjects with COPD with similar 
diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide values. Of patients who did not require 
oxygen with submaximal UP testing, 49% with IPF and 24% with COPD required 
oxygen at HL exertion. Conclusions: The RTPET identified higher oxygen flow 
needs at HL exertion in patients with IPF versus patients with COPD; however, in 
both diseases, there was a significant proportion of patients who were only 
found to have exertional desaturation at HL exertion. Reliance on submaximal 
testing may fail to meet the needs of patients with IPF and COPD. Further 
studies are needed to determine if oxygen prescriptions targeting the highest 
level of desaturation improve clinical outcomes, symptoms, or quality of life.

Wearable sensors, including accelerometers, are a widely accepted tool to assess 
gait in clinical and free-living environments. Methods to identify phases and 
subphases of the gait cycle are necessary for comprehensive assessment of 
pathological gait. The current study evaluated the accuracy of a finite state 
machine (FSM) algorithm to detect strides by identifying gait cycle subphases 
from ankle-worn accelerometry. Algorithm performance was challenged across a 
range of speeds (0.4-2.6 m/s), task conditions (e.g., single- and dual-task 
walking), and individual characteristics. Specifically, the study included a 
range of treadmill speeds in young adults and overground walking conditions in 
older adults with neurological disease. Manually counted and algorithm-derived 
stride detection from acceleration data were evaluated using error analysis and 
Bland-Altman plots for visualization. Overall, the algorithm successfully 
detected strides (>96 % accuracy) across gait speed ranges and tasks, for young 
and older adults. The accuracy of an FSM algorithm combined with ankle-worn 
accelerometers, provides an analytical approach with affordable and portable 
tools that permits comprehensive assessment of gait unbounded by setting and 
proves to perform well in in walking tasks characterized by variable walking. 
These algorithm capabilities and advancements are critical for identifying phase 
dependent gait impairments in clinical and free-living assessment.

Metatarsal fractures are one of the most common injuries of the foot, accounting 
for approximately 5% to 6% of all fractures confronted in the outpatient 
setting1. Approximately 45% to 70% of these fractures involve the fifth 
metatarsal, which have been described using a 3 zonal approach in 1993 by 
Lawrence and Botte2. Zone 2 fractures are difficult to manage given their 
retrograde vascular supply, leading to higher rates of nonunion1,3. Jones 
fractures (zone 2) are primarily treated surgically, with the 2 main methods 
being intramedullary screw fixation and plate fixation3. Surgical management 
leads to higher rates of union when compared with nonoperative modalities. 
Presented here is a technique for zone 2 intra-articular Jones fractures with 
minimal to moderate displacement via open reduction and internal fixation. This 
technique is not recommended for comminuted fractures or those with proximal 
split fractures. Starting with the foot lateral, this technique requires 
meticulous marking of the anatomical landmarks of the distal fibula as well as 
the fifth metatarsal to establish the precise starting point for the guidewire. 
Using a mini c-arm, a high and inside positioning should be confirmed prior to 
advancing the guidewire from proximal to distal while remaining positioned in 
the center of the medullary canal. Capitalizing on the variable pitch of a 
5.0-mm headless compression screw, the Jones fracture is compressed to ensure 
primary bone healing. The incision is then closed, and a soft wrap is utilized 
followed by 2 weeks of non-weight-bearing and progressive protective 
weight-bearing until a complete recovery is achieved.
BACKGROUND: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for the operative 
treatment of zone-2 intra-articular Jones fractures with minimal to moderate 
displacement is recommended because of the high rate of nonunion associated with 
nonoperative treatment. The blood supply to this region is minimal because of 
its retrograde flow, leading to high rates of nonunion with nonoperative 
treatment. The presently described technique offers reduction and fixation of a 
zone-2 fracture, as well as improved functional outcomes and nonunion rates. 
This approach is minimally invasive, as it is performed percutaneously, leading 
to a decrease in soft-tissue damage, infection rates, and operative time.
DESCRIPTION: The zone-2 fifth metatarsal ORIF technique begins with the use of a 
marking pen to outline the distal fibula and the head of the fifth metatarsal 
for proper orientation. Fluoroscopy is utilized to identify the landmarks so 
that a guidewire can be placed into the proximal dorsal aspect of the fifth 
metatarsal. Placement is confirmed on multiple radiographic images. The 
guidewire is then slowly inserted down the medullary canal of the fifth 
metatarsal, with placement verified on multiple fluoroscopic images. Once 
placement is confirmed, screw size is estimated with use of radiographic 
measurements. An incision is made bluntly and dissected down, going high and 
medial in order to protect the sural nerve and the peroneus brevis tendon 
insertion. The path is then drilled with use of a cannulated screw system. 
Biomechanically, a full-core screw is preferable, ranging from 4.5 to 5.5 mm 
depending on the canal diameter. For the example procedure shown in the video, a 
full-core 5-mm screw was inserted until appreciable reduction of the fracture 
was observed on fluoroscopic visualization, with additional confirmation on 
multiple radiographic views. Once satisfied with the placement, the guidewire is 
removed and the site is irrigated and closed with use of 3-0 nylon suture. A 
weight-based combination of short and long-acting local anesthetics (ropivacaine 
and lidocaine) is then injected around the incision site as part of a 
postoperative multimodal pain regimen. The area is then cleaned and dried. 
Xeroform, 4 × 4s, Army battle dressings, and a soft wrap are then applied, 
followed by a postoperative boot.
ALTERNATIVES: Poor surgical candidates include those with neuropathic feet, 
local infection, presence of severe vascular insufficiency, and comorbidities 
that would make surgery dangerous. Such patients can undergo nonoperative 
treatment, which includes 4 to 6 weeks of non-weight-bearing in a cast until 
union is confirmed radiographically. Once union is confirmed, patients undergo 4 
to 6 more weeks of weight-bearing in a boot. One meta-analysis found that 
nonoperative treatment led to nonunion rates between 15% and 30%, notably higher 
than with operative treatment (0% to 11%)6. Most cases of zone-2 fifth 
metatarsal fracture are treated operatively, with intramedullary screw or plate 
fixation being the primary techniques. Intramedullary screw fixation is the 
technique featured in the present video, and offers the advantage of decreased 
soft-tissue injury, infection, and operative time because of its percutaneous 
approach. Percutaneous screw fixation is not recommended for comminuted 
fractures or those with proximal-split fracture patterns7,8. Fractures with 
these patterns should be critically evaluated with additional radiographic 
work-up. ORIF utilizing hook plates or fracture-specific plate implants may be 
warranted in these cases. In cases of chronic nonunion or fractures with 
sclerotic margins, an additional percutaneous incision over the fracture site is 
recommended to fenestrate the fracture edges and allow bone grafting prior to 
screw insertion7,8.
RATIONALE: ORIF of zone-2 intra-articular Jones fractures with minimal to 
moderate displacement with use of an intramedullary screw is a low-risk and 
highly successful surgical approach to these common fractures. Because of the 
watershed region at zone 2 of the fifth metatarsal, nonunion rates with 
nonoperative treatment are relatively high (between 15% and 30%)4,6. Another 
study of 22 patients showed a 100% union rate following operative treatment of 
acute Jones fracture5. These studies, along with others, provide strong evidence 
to suggest the benefit of early operative treatment with use of screw fixation, 
as compared with nonoperative treatment.
EXPECTED OUTCOMES: Postoperatively, these patients are managed with a standard 
protocol established by our institution. The first 2 weeks include being in a 
soft wrap and postoperative boot while being non-weight-bearing. The patient 
should keep the incision clean and dry, elevate the foot/ankle often, and follow 
activity guidelines. Sutures are removed at 2 to 6 weeks postoperatively, and 
the boot should be used for all weight-bearing ambulation, with crutches being 
utilized for the transition. Additionally, ankle range-of-motion exercises and 
strengthening should begin. Weight-bearing should transition as follows: 25% at 
week 3, 50% at week 4, 75% at week 5, and 100% at week 6. At weeks 6 to 8, 
walking and physical therapy should be increased and previous exercises should 
be continued. At weeks 8 to 12, pool or treadmill activity should begin, and it 
should be increased thereafter. Patients should expect evidence of radiographic 
union between weeks 6 and 10, with a meta-analysis showing union rates with 
screw fixation between 89% and 100%6.
IMPORTANT TIPS: Guidewire insertion should be proximal and dorsal, allowing the 
guidewire to enter at the high and inside position. To do so, palpate the 
proximal aspect of the fifth metatarsal and outline the contour on the skin, 
then mark the incision 1 to 3 cm proximal to this to avoid unnecessary 
soft-tissue tension and potential wound issues. This incision is parallel and 
generally inferior to the sural nerve, but arborization and branching are highly 
variable. Utilizing a high and inside starting point avoids the more lateral and 
plantar insertion of the peroneus brevis. The high and inside starting point is 
verified under anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiographic views. This 
position biomechanically avoids plantar gapping and reduces the risk to 
soft-tissue structures.Utilizing a mini c-arm or fluoroscopy unit allows 
multiple views for ideal screw alignment to be obtained quickly, with decreased 
radiation exposure.Utilizing an all-cannulated system allows for a seamless 
transition from drilling to screw placement.Avoid making the incision too close 
to the proximal aspect of the fifth metatarsal, as this would cause unnecessary 
soft-tissue tension and potential wound issues. The incision should be made 1 to 
3 cm proximal to the proximal aspect of the fifth metatarsal.Use adequate 
soft-tissue retraction, as protecting the sural nerve is paramount during screw 
insertion.Do not allow the patient to be weight-bearing immediately. We strongly 
recommend that the patient be non-weight-bearing for 2 weeks and then perform 
progressive protected weight-bearing in a postoperative boot for 4 weeks.

BACKGROUND: Heterogeneous types of gait impairment are common post-stroke. 
Studies used supervised and unsupervised machine learning on discrete 
biomechanical features to summarize the gait cycle and identify common patterns 
of gait behaviors. However, discrete features cannot account for temporal 
variations that occur during gait. Here, we propose a novel machine-learning 
pipeline to identify subgroups of gait behaviors post-stroke using kinematic 
time series data.
METHODS: We analyzed ankle and knee kinematic data during treadmill walking data 
in 39 individuals post-stroke and 28 neurotypical controls. The data were first 
input into a supervised dual-stage Convolutional Neural Network-Temporal 
Convolutional Network, trained to extract temporal and spatial gait features. 
Then, we used these features to find clusters of different gait behaviors using 
unsupervised time series k-means. We repeated the clustering process using 
10,000 bootstrap training data samples and a Gaussian Mixture Model to identify 
stable clusters representative of our dataset. Finally, we assessed the 
kinematic differences between the identified clusters using 1D statistical 
parametric mapping ANOVA. We then compared gait spatiotemporal and clinical 
characteristics between clusters using one-way ANOVA.
RESULTS: We obtained five clusters: two clusters of neurotypical individuals (C1 
and C2) and three clusters of individuals post-stroke (S1, S2, S3). C1 had 
kinematics that resembled the normative gait pattern. Individuals in C2 had a 
shorter stride time than C1. Individuals in S1 had mild impairment and walked 
with increased bilateral knee flexion during the loading response. Individuals 
in S2 had moderate impairment, were the slowest among the clusters, took shorter 
steps, had increased knee flexion during stance bilaterally and reduced paretic 
knee flexion during swing. Individuals in S3 had mild impairment, asymmetric 
swing time, had increased ankle abduction during the gait cycle and reduced 
dorsiflexion bilaterally during loading response and stance. Every individual 
was assigned to a cluster with a cluster membership likelihood above 93%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that joint kinematics in individuals 
post-stroke are distinct from controls, even in those individuals with mild 
impairment. The three subgroups post-stroke showed distinct kinematic 
impairments during specific phases in the gait cycle, providing additional 
information to clinicians for gait retraining interventions.

BACKGROUND: Individuals after stroke walk with different step parameters and 
consequently with different margins of stability compared to able-bodied peers. 
These differences might be a side effect of lower preferred walking speeds or 
primary limitations in regulating step parameters and margins of stability after 
stroke.
METHODS: Twenty-eight individuals after stroke (separated into more impaired and 
less impaired based on speed) and fourteen able-bodied peers completed five 
walking trials on an instrumented treadmill at 70 %, 85 %, 100 %, 115 %, and 
130 % of their preferred speed. Center of pressure data were used to calculate 
stride frequency, stride length, step width and margins of stability in 
mediolateral and anteroposterior direction. Generalized estimation equations 
were used to analyze the (interaction) effects of group, speed, and most versus 
least affected leg on these parameters.
FINDINGS: When controlled for speed, all individuals after stroke walked with 
higher stride frequencies (P < 0.001) and shorter stride lengths (P < 0.001) 
than able-bodied peers. Less impaired individuals walked with larger step widths 
than able-bodied peers (P < 0.001). The interaction effect of group and speed 
suggested that individuals after stroke showed higher increases in stride length 
with increasing speed than able-bodied peers. When controlled for speed, 
mediolateral margins of stability were larger in less impaired individuals 
compared to able-bodied peers, but otherwise, margins of stability did not 
differ between groups. Only minor differences between the most and least 
affected leg were observed.
INTERPRETATION: Differences in step parameters between individuals after stroke 
and able-bodied peers seem independent of walking speed and function to enhance 
gait stability.

Introduction Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are responsible for childhood 
brain dysfunction and developmental disability. Physical therapists are 
important team members in providing a beneficial impact on the gross motor 
function of children with NDDs. Early intervention provides a beneficial effect 
on the improvement of gross motor function; however, most of the studies on 
treadmill training were in late age and the effect of early treadmill walking 
along with conventional physiotherapy was not studied. Hence, the objective of 
the present study was to compare the effect of overground walking with treadmill 
walking in young children aged 12-36 months with non-progressive NDDs. 
Methodology An experimental study was performed for one year on diagnosed cases 
of non-progressive NDD. A total of 36 children with non-progressive NDD were 
recruited for the study between the ages of 12 and 36 months of either gender 
and were allocated into treadmill walking and overground walking groups. The 
intervention was given for eight consecutive weeks, four days per week, and for 
20-25 minutes per day. The children were assessed using Gross Motor Function 
Measure-66 (GMFM-66) and Peabody Developmental Motor Scale-2 (PDMS-2) for both 
stationary and locomotion components. Results The comparison of both the groups 
with PDMS-2 (stationary) at baseline, follow-up, and post intervention reported 
mean values of 25.56 ± 12.16, 27.22 ± 11.74, and 28.44 ± 11.72, respectively, in 
the overground walking group and 28.72 ± 8.96, 29.72 ± 9.46, and 31.33 ± 8.85 in 
the treadmill walking group, respectively, with statistically significant 
results (p = 0.0022). Additionally, the comparison of both the groups with 
PDMS-2 (locomotion) reported mean values of 35.78 ± 24.02, 39.11 ± 23.21, and 
43.00 ± 23.58, respectively, in the overground walking group and 39.67 ± 22.28, 
43.17 ± 22.94, and 46.61 ± 24.16 in the treadmill walking group, respectively, 
with statistically significant results (p = 0.020). Moreover, the comparison of 
both the groups with total GMFM-66 reported mean values of 16.97 ± 14.52, 18.35 
± 14.88, and 20.49 ± 16.86, respectively, in the overground walking group and 
18.52 ± 14.28, 21.66 ± 15.76, and 25.92 ± 16.95 in the treadmill walking group 
with statistically significant results (p = 0.0118). Conclusion The present 
study concluded that between both the groups, a statistically significant 
difference was observed for PDMS-2 (stationary and locomotion) and GMFM-66 after 
a scheduled intervention of eight weeks. Hence, walking should be carried out as 
a part of therapy in early intervention and further studies can be performed to 
determine the long-term effect of these interventions and their role in the 
prevention of secondary complications.

Quantitative biomechanical gait analysis is an important clinical and research 
tool for injury and disease diagnosis and treatment. However, one major 
criticism is that gait analysis laboratories largely operate in isolation and 
there is a lack of benchmark datasets, which can be used to advance research and 
statistical methodologies. To address this, we present an open biomechanics 
dataset of n = 1798 healthy and injured, young and older adults during treadmill 
walking and/or running at a range of gait speeds. The full dataset is available 
on Figshare+ and data files are contained within a series of zipped folders with 
folder names representing the subject ID. Each subject ID folder contains 
walking and/or running data containing raw marker trajectory data along with 
metadata for each participant. Five tutorials are also provided, demonstrating 
aspects such as loading data files, sample analyses of discrete variables, and 
calculating joint angles from code along with covering more complex topics such 
as principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction, statistical 
parametric mapping, and conducting unsupervised clustering.

PURPOSE: In this study, we investigated whether experimental knee pain alters 
lower limb kinematics and knee arthrokinematics during gait, and if this motor 
adaptation depends on the spatial characteristics of the painful stimulus.
METHODS: Twenty-one participants walked on a treadmill for 60-s trials, either 
without stimulation or while experiencing painful electrical stimulation in the 
medial, lateral or anterior region of the knee. Perceived pain location was 
analyzed using pain drawing. Gait spatiotemporal parameters, lower limb 
kinematics, and dispersion of the knee helical axes on the sagittal plane were 
quantified for each trial and compared between conditions using ANOVAs with 
repeated measures or Friedman tests.
RESULTS: Pain perception was localized in the area the stimulation was applied 
to. Compared to walking without pain, participants demonstrated reduced knee 
extension (1.5 ± 1.5 degrees, p = 0.002) and reduced hip extension (0.8 ± 1.1 
degrees, p = 0.037) when pain was induced in the anterior region, but not 
medially or laterally. Anterior knee pain increased the mean distance of the 
helical axes during late stance (0.7 [0.3, 1.4], p = 0.010), while medial pain 
increased both mean distance (0.3 [0.1, 0.5], p = 0.037) and mean angle 
(1.2 ± 1.4, p = 0.010) during early swing.
CONCLUSION: Acute, experimental knee pain alters gait kinematics and increases 
the dispersion of the helical axis. These adaptations depend on the spatial 
characteristics of the painful stimulus. These adaptations may reflect an 
attempt of the central nervous system to protect the painful tissue while 
searching for a less painful movement strategy.

INTRODUCTION: Walking is crucial for knee articular cartilage (KAC) health. 
Routine MRI sequences lack sensitivity for early cartilage changes, and the use 
of parametric T2 maps to study the effect of walking on KAC composition is 
limited. This study aimed to evaluate if quantitative T2 maps using an Echo 
Modulation Curve (EMC) matching algorithm can detect KAC T2 variations due to 
water content changes after walking.
METHODS: Seven asymptomatic volunteers (3 females, 4 males, mean age 28.3 years) 
without knee pathologies participated. Sagittal knee MRI scans were performed 
before and after a 9-min treadmill walk using a Modified Bruce protocol. 
T2-weighted Multi-Echo Spin-Echo KAC images were acquired at 3T. Tibiofemoral 
cartilage was segmented semi-automatically on three slices per knee, defining 39 
KAC samples. Quantitative T2 maps were created using a dictionary-matching 
algorithm. Paired t-tests assessed exercise impact on KAC T2 values, independent 
t-tests compared group differences, and Friedman test with Bonferroni correction 
evaluated regional T2 changes.
RESULTS: Walking increased KAC T2 values (mean difference (md) 0.61 ± 1.71 ms; 
p = 0.016). Significant differences were observed in ""normal"" BMI group (md 
0.69 ± 1.27 ms; p = 0.021). Regional analysis revealed significant differences 
in medial femur in males (md 0.9 ± 2.1 ms; p = 0.049) and lateral tibia in 
females (md 1.4 ± 2.5 ms; p = 0.046). The medial tibia showed significant 
differences across sub-regions (p = 0.026).
CONCLUSION: Quantitative T2 maps using the EMC matching algorithm detected 
consistent changes in KAC T2 values after a short walking period.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: EMC quantitative T2 maps effectively detected knee 
cartilage changes post-walking. This technique could improve cartilage hydration 
assessments, aiding early detection in at-risk patients. It also suggests 
potential for personalized monitoring and rehabilitation, advancing 
musculoskeletal imaging and non-invasive joint health monitoring.

This study examines the energy expenditure and physiological responses 
associated with short-term quadrupedal locomotion compared to bipedal walking in 
humans. It aims to support evolutionary theory and explore quadrupedal 
locomotion's potential for enhancing fitness and health. In a randomized 
crossover design, 12 participants performed quadrupedal and bipedal walking on a 
treadmill at identical speeds. Physiological responses, including energy 
expenditure, carbohydrate oxidation rates, respiratory rate, and heart rate, 
were measured during both forms of locomotion. Quadrupedal walking significantly 
increased total energy expenditure by 4.15 Kcal/min [95% CI, 3.11 - 5.19 
Kcal/min], due to a rise in carbohydrate oxidation of 1.70 g/min [95% CI, 
1.02 - 2.24 g/min]. It also increased respiratory and heart rates, indicating 
higher metabolic demands. The exercise mainly activated upper limb muscles and 
the gluteus maximus in the lower limbs. Ten minutes of quadrupedal walking at 
the same speed as bipedal walking resulted in a 254.48% increase in energy 
consumption. This simple form of locomotion offers a strategy for enhancing 
physical activity, and supports the idea that energy optimization influenced the 
evolution of efficient bipedal locomotion.

CONTEXT: Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is a movement-related 
condition associated with pain and impaired function; yet the evidence for level 
ground walking hip biomechanics is limited and inconsistent. Challenging the hip 
with inclined walking for individuals with FAIS might be important for 
elucidating mechanically driven function loss and informing tailored 
rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 
progressive inclined walking on sagittal hip biomechanics and hip flexor and 
extensor activity in individuals with FAIS.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
METHODS: Fourteen participants (7 individuals with FAIS and 7 asymptomatic 
individuals) underwent motion capture and electromyographic analysis during 3 
treadmill walking conditions (0°/5°/10°). Statistical parametric mapping was 
used to compare the sagittal hip kinematic waveforms and hip flexor (rectus 
femoris) and extensor (gluteus maximus) waveforms between groups and walking 
conditions.
RESULTS: Hip flexion was significantly increased throughout the gait cycle in 
individuals with FAIS compared with asymptomatic individuals (P < .01) but was 
not dependent on incline. Rectus femoris activation was significantly increased 
throughout stance in individuals with FAIS compared with asymptomatic 
individuals (P < .01). Gluteus maximus activity significantly increased with 
progressive inclination in asymptomatic individuals (P < .01), with no 
significant change in activity for individuals with FAIS.
CONCLUSIONS: Hip biomechanics and muscle activity during inclined walking 
mirrored that of arthrogenic muscle inhibition, highlighted by a prominent 
flexor role and lack of hip extensor activity in individuals with FAIS. Future 
research investigating discordant activity between hip flexors and extensors 
during complex functional tasks may help identify rehabilitation targets.

OBJECTIVE: Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a promising non-invasive 
strategy in which brief episodes of ischaemia and reperfusion can increase 
skeletal muscle resistance to ischaemia and improve mobility. This study aimed 
to determine whether 28 consecutive days of RIPC improved intermittent 
claudication (IC) symptoms compared with sham intervention.
METHODS: This single centre, parallel, randomised, sham controlled, double blind 
trial was conducted from January 2022 to April 2023 in outpatient settings. 
Forty two patients with stable IC Fontaine stage IIa or IIb were randomised to 
RIPC or sham for 28 days. The pre-specified primary outcome was a change in the 
maximum walking distance (MWD) after 28 days measured with a treadmill test. A 
> 10% change in MWD was considered clinically significant. Change in 
intermittent claudication distance (ICD), time to relief from claudication 
(TRC), and health related quality of life (HRQoL) measured with the VascuQoL-6 
questionnaire were the secondary outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05084066).
RESULTS: Forty one men (RIPC = 23, sham = 18) aged 64.9 ± 7.4 years were 
analysed. A change of > 10% in MWD occurred in 14 patients in the RIPC group vs. 
eight patients in the sham group (relative risk 1.37, 95% confidence interval 
0.74 - 2.25; p = .35). Changes in ICD, TRC, and HRQoL between the groups were 
not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: In this trial, RIPC did not significantly improve MWD, ICD, or TRC 
compared with treatment with a sham device.

Quantifying individualized rehabilitation responses and optimizing therapy for 
each person is challenging. For interventions like treadmill training, there are 
multiple parameters, such as speed or incline, that can be adjusted throughout 
sessions. This study evaluates if causal modeling and Bayesian Additive 
Regression Trees (BART) can be used to accurately track the direct effects of 
treadmill training on gait. We developed a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to 
specify the assumed relationship between training input parameters and 
spatiotemporal outcomes during Short Burst Locomotor Treadmill Training (SBLTT), 
a therapy designed specifically for children with cerebral palsy (CP). We 
evaluated outcomes after 24 sessions of SBLTT for simulated datasets of 150 
virtual participants and experimental data from four children with CP, ages 
4-13 years old. Individual BART models were created from treadmill data of each 
step. Simulated datasets demonstrated that BART could accurately identify 
specified responses to training, including strong correlations for step length 
progression (R2 = 0.73) and plateaus (R2 = 0.87). Model fit was stronger for 
participants with less step-to-step variability but did not impact model 
accuracy. For experimental data, participants' step lengths increased by 
26 ± 13% after 24 sessions. Using BART to control for speed or incline, we found 
that step length increased for three participants (direct effect: 13.5 ± 4.5%), 
while one participant decreased step length (-11.6%). SBLTT had minimal effects 
on step length asymmetry and step width. Tools such as BART can leverage 
step-by-step data collected during training for researchers and clinicians to 
monitor progression, optimize rehabilitation protocols, and inform the causal 
mechanisms driving individual responses.

OBJECTIVE: Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) can reduce joint range of motion 
and strength, cause edema, and increase joint stiffness. Here we set out to 
determine whether quadriceps DOMS followed by an active recovery low-intensity 
exercise alters jump landing biomechanics.
METHODS: 3D landing kinematics, kinetics, and DOMS were evaluated in 26 healthy 
adults (15 women) performing drop and vertical jump landings before and after a 
squat protocol to induce quadriceps DOMS. In the presence of DOMS, half of the 
participants (n = 13) performed a low-intensity exercise for active recovery 
(10-minute treadmill walking), while the other half (n = 13) did not. 
Descriptive statistics and generalized estimative equations were applied to 
determine the effects of DOMS and active recovery on landing kinematics and 
kinetics.
RESULTS: DOMS decreased knee and ankle flexion angles and increased knee and 
ankle frontal plane angles during vertical jumps. DOMS elicited a longer time to 
reach peak ground reaction force during drop jumps. Low-intensity exercise for 
active recovery reduced DOMS perception but did not alter the biomechanics of 
landing.
CONCLUSION: DOMS changes landing strategy. However, including a low-intensity 
exercise for active recovery before landing practice did not change the 
kinematics and kinetics of landing.

AIMS: In many low-income countries, fasting glucose is the primary measure for 
monitoring glycaemic control. Many patients in these countries walk long 
distances to the clinic, but the impact of walking on fasting glucose in type 2 
diabetes is unknown. We aimed to determine the impact of walking on fasting 
glucose in people with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: In a randomised crossover trial, the change in glucose from baseline in 
the fasting state was compared between walking on a treadmill at a predetermined 
speed of 4.5 km/h for 1 h and not walking (resting) in people with type 2 
diabetes.
RESULTS: In all, 45 participants were enrolled and all completed both visits; 
21/45 (46.7%) were women, and the median age was 51. Glucose during and after 
walking was similar to glucose while at rest; the glucose difference (walking 
minus rest) was -0.15 (95% CI: -0.55, 0.26) and -0.10 (95% CI: -0.50, 0.31) 
mmol/L at 1 and 2 h, respectively, p > 0.4 for both.
CONCLUSIONS: Fasting plasma glucose is not meaningfully affected by prolonged 
walking in participants with type 2 diabetes; therefore, the reliability of 
fasting glucose for monitoring glycaemic burden is unlikely to be altered in 
patients who walk to the clinic.

This study proposes a wearable gait assessment method using inertial measurement 
units (IMUs) to evaluate gait ability in daily environments. By focusing on the 
estimation of the margin of stability (MoS), a key kinematic stability 
parameter, a method using a convolutional neural network, was developed to 
estimate the MoS from IMU acceleration time-series data. The relationship 
between MoS and other stability indices, such as the Lyapunov exponent and the 
multi-site time-series (MSTS) index, using data from five IMU sensors placed on 
various body parts was also examined. To simulate diverse gait conditions, 
treadmill speed was varied, and a knee-ankle-foot orthosis was used to restrict 
left knee extension, inducing gait asymmetry. The model achieved over 90% 
accuracy in classifying MoS in both forward and lateral directions using 
three-axis acceleration data from the IMUs. However, the correlation between MoS 
and the Lyapunov exponent or MSTS index was weak, suggesting that these indices 
may capture different aspects of gait stability.

increased in treadmill walking with brain-computer interface (BCI) control. 
However, the reorganization of cortical functional connectivity in treadmill 
walking with BCI control is largely unknown. To investigate this, a public 
dataset, a mobile brain-body imaging dataset recorded during treadmill walking 
with a brain-computer interface, was used. The electroencephalography 
(EEG)-coupling strength of the between-region and within-region during the 
continuous self-determinant movements of lower limbs were analyzed. The 
time-frequency cross-mutual information (TFCMI) method was used to calculate the 
coupling strength. The results showed the frontal-occipital connection increased 
in the gamma and delta bands (the threshold of the edge was >0.05) during 
walking with BCI, which may be related to the effective communication when 
subjects adjust their gaits to control the avatar. In walking with BCI control, 
the results showed theta oscillation within the left-frontal, which may be 
related to error processing and decision making. We also found that 
between-region connectivity was suppressed in walking with and without BCI 
control compared with in standing states. These findings suggest that walking 
with BCI may accelerate the rehabilitation process for lower limb stroke.

Wearable technologies such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) can be used to 
evaluate human gait and improve mobility, but sensor fixation is still a 
limitation that needs to be addressed. Therefore, aim of this study was to 
create a machine learning algorithm to predict gait events using a single IMU 
mimicking the carrying of a smartphone. Fifty-two healthy adults (35 males/17 
females) walked on a treadmill at various speeds while carrying a surrogate 
smartphone in the right hand, front right trouser pocket, and right jacket 
pocket. Ground-truth gait events (e.g. heel strikes and toe-offs) were 
determined bilaterally using a gold standard optical motion capture system. The 
tri-dimensional accelerometer and gyroscope data were segmented in 20-ms 
windows, which were labelled as containing or not the gait events. A long-short 
term memory neural network (LSTM-NN) was used to classify the 20-ms windows as 
containing the heel strike or toe-off for the right or left legs, using 80% of 
the data for training and 20% of the data for testing. The results demonstrated 
an overall accuracy of 92% across all phone positions and walking speeds, with a 
slightly higher accuracy for the right-side predictions (∼94%) when compared to 
the left side (∼91%). Moreover, we found a median time error <3% of the gait 
cycle duration across all speeds and positions (∼77 ms). Our results represent a 
promising first step towards using smartphones for remote gait analysis without 
requiring IMU fixation, but further research is needed to enhance 
generalizability and explore real-world deployment.

PURPOSE: Following short-term weight loss, the energetic cost of transport 
decreases and exercise efficiency increases. Whether changes persist during 
long-term weight maintenance is unknown.
METHODS: We compared walking economy and exercise efficiency in weight loss 
maintainers (WLM, maintaining ≥13.6 kg weight loss for ≥1 year), controls 
without obesity (NC, BMI similar to current BMI of WLM), and controls with 
overweight/obesity (OC, BMI similar to pre-weight loss BMI of WLM). Energy 
expenditure (EE) and respiratory quotient were measured using indirect 
calorimetry at rest, while standing, and during treadmill walking. Gross and net 
energetic cost of transport (J/kg/m) was measured during level treadmill walking 
at 0.75, 1.12, and 1.52 m/s. Gross, net, and delta efficiency (%) were measured 
during inclined treadmill walking (2 %, 4 %, and 6 % grade) and a constant speed 
(1.12 m/s).
RESULTS: WLM (n = 32, BMI: 23.8 ± 2.3 kg/m2) and NC (n = 28, BMI: 22.7 ± 1.6 
kg/m2) had significantly lower EE (kJ/min) compared to OC (n = 26, BMI: 33.0 ± 
4.5 kg/m2) during rest, standing, and walking (p < 0.01). Net energetic cost of 
transport was significantly lower in WLM compared to OC at 1.12 and 1.52 m/s (p 
< 0.05). Net efficiency was significantly greater in WLM compared to OC while 
walking (p ≤ 0.05). There were no significant differences between WLM and NC for 
any measures of economy or efficiency.
CONCLUSION: WLM had lower walking economy and greater walking efficiency 
compared to OC, but there were no differences between WLM and NC. Thus, 
individuals maintaining significant weight loss may be successful with long-term 
weight loss, in part, due to resistance against adaptive reductions in walking 
energetics.

BACKGROUND: Inertial systems are increasingly used to analyze human motion, 
especially for gait analyses and in clinical settings. Calibration methods for 
these systems are designed for ease of implementation, and previous studies have 
shown that they can provide accurate knee kinematics in the sagittal plane. 
However, the reason of their lack of accuracy in the other planes (i.e., 
transverse and frontal) remain unknown.
RESEARCH QUESTION: This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of one posture 
of a double-pose calibration method to analyse 3D knee kinematics during gait 
with two magnetic inertial measurement units (MIMU). This method consists of a 
standing posture and a posture with the leg stretched forward in the sagittal 
plane, which together define the sagittal plane. Our hypothesis was that a 
change in the definition of the sagittal plane during the calibration process 
was likely to affect the assessment of knee kinematics in the frontal and 
transverse planes.
METHODS: Ten healthy participants wearing the KneeKG system and two MIMU 
completed the calibration process in five different leg positions (0°, 3°, 5°, 
10° or 15° from the sagittal plane) for the second calibration posture. After 
static calibration, the participants walked on an instrumented treadmill at a 
speed of 1.1 m/s and 3D knee kinematics were calculated using the five different 
calibration conditions.
RESULTS: Mean absolute difference (MAD) between the swing-phase peak value of 
the curve corresponding to the leg in the sagittal plane (0° shift from this 
plane) when performing the second calibration posture and each of the other 
curves was 0.20-0.46° for knee flexion, 1.67-2.90° for adduction, and 0.72-1.46° 
for external rotation. MAD of the swing-phase peak value in the frontal plane 
was correlated (R2=0.81) with the angulation of the femur in the sagittal plane 
during calibration.
SIGNIFICANCE: An angular shift from the sagittal plane when performing a 
double-pose calibration method induces a minimal influence on the knee 
flexion/extension but larger influences on secondary knee motions.

Associations Between Body Mass Index, Gait Biomechanics, and In Vivo Cartilage 
Function After Exercise in Those With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.

Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.

BACKGROUND: Both high body mass index (BMI) and anterior cruciate ligament 
reconstruction (ACLR) independently influence knee osteoarthritis risk. 
Preliminary evidence shows the combination of these risk factors leads to poorer 
recovery and altered biomechanical outcomes after ACLR, but few studies have 
directly evaluated early changes in cartilage health between normal-BMI and 
high-BMI groups in this population.
PURPOSE: To evaluate ultrasound-based measures of cartilage strain and 
compositional changes (via echo-intensity [EI]) in response to an incline 
walking stress test between normal-BMI and high-BMI individuals with ACLR. A 
secondary evaluation was conducted of associations between habitual walking 
biomechanics (ie, ground-reaction forces, sagittal knee kinetics and kinematics) 
and cartilage strain and EI outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.
METHODS: Gait biomechanics and femoral trochlear ultrasound analyses were 
evaluated in 64 participants with ACLR who had normal BMI (BMI < 27.0; n = 40) 
and high BMI (BMI ≥ 27.0; n = 24). Ultrasound images were collected bilaterally 
before and after an incline treadmill walk, and medial and lateral trochlear 
strain and EI changes pre-post exercise were used to compare BMI groups and 
limbs. Gait outcomes included ground-reaction forces, peak sagittal plane knee 
moments, angles, and excursions and were used to determine associations with 
cartilage outcomes in the entire cohort.
RESULTS: High-BMI individuals with ACLR exhibited greater medial trochlear 
cartilage strain in the ACLR limb compared with normal-BMI individuals 
(approximately 6%; P < .01). In those with high BMI, the ACLR limb exhibited 
greater medial trochlear strain relative to non-ACLR limbs (approximately 4%; P 
< .05), but between-limb differences were not observed in the normal-BMI group 
(P > .05). Medial trochlear EI changes were greater bilaterally in those with 
high BMI compared with normal-BMI ACLR counterparts (approximately 10%; P < 
.01). Last, individuals who walked with greater peak knee flexion angles 
exhibited less medial cartilage strain (ΔR2 = 0.06; P = .025).
CONCLUSION: The data suggested that high BMI affects cartilage functional 
properties after ACLR, whereas smaller knee flexion angles were associated with 
larger medial cartilage strain.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: High-BMI individuals with ACLR may represent a subset of 
patients exhibiting earlier declines in cartilage functional integrity in 
response to loading, necessitating additional or more targeted interventions to 
mitigate disease development.

Gait Symmetric Adaptation and Aftereffect Through Concurrent Split-Belt 
Treadmill Walking and Explicit Visual Feedback Distortion.

Kim SJ, Save O, Tanner E, Marquez A, Lee H.

OBJECTIVE: Gait asymmetry can be improved with various gait training methods. 
Combining split-belt treadmill walking (SB) with visual feedback distortion (VD) 
could enhance motor learning, improving gait symmetry adaptation and retention. 
This study compared step length symmetry adaptation and aftereffects between 
SB-only and combined explicit VD with SB, as well as between explicit VD-only 
and combined explicit VD with SB.
METHOD: The 28-minute trials included three phases: a 3-minute baseline, a 
10-minute adaptation, and a 15-minute post-adaptation. In the VD trial, two bars 
representing step lengths were displayed, with the right bar gradually 
decreasing by 3% to prompt participants to consciously correct their steps to 
match the heights of the two bars. In the SB trial, the right treadmill belt 
speed was incrementally increased by 5%. The VD+SB trial combined both 
perturbations. After the removal of these perturbations, the aftereffect of the 
adapted asymmetric step length was evaluated in the post-adaptation period.
RESULTS: During the adaptation period, the step length symmetry ratio shifted 
negatively in the SB trial, while it increased positively in the VD trial, 
indicating longer right steps than left. In the VD+SB trial, subjects extended 
their right step more than their left. Notably, the VD+SB trial demonstrated a 
longer aftereffect compared to both the SB-only and VD-only trials.
CONCLUSION: The visual distortion paradigm can be explicitly applied and 
integrated with split-belt treadmill walking to enhance the efficacy of 
symmetric gait adaptation, resulting in more sustained effects on the retention 
of newly learned motor patterns.

BACKGROUND: Walking speed, a key element of gait analysis, is essential for 
evaluating the biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system and is typically 
assessed on flat surfaces, such as walkways or treadmills. While many authors 
have compared the differences and similarities between treadmill and overground 
walking, no studies have yet investigated the differences between treadmill gait 
analysis at self-selected speed (SS) and overground simulated speed (OS). The 
hypothesis is that accurate kinematic measurements depend on selecting the 
correct gait speed; however, a mismatch between the perceived comfortable 
treadmill speed and actual overground speed may affect the accuracy of treadmill 
gait analyses. This study aimed to assess treadmill gait in healthy young adults 
by comparing the SS with the OS. The objectives were to determine whether 
participants could match SS with OS on a treadmill, examine sex differences in 
gait kinematics and spatiotemporal parameters (KSP) at different speeds, and 
identify which speed better reflects natural gait kinematics.
METHODS: A total of 60 healthy men and 70 healthy women, aged 22-35 years, 
participated in this cross-sectional study to investigate the gait kinematics 
and spatiotemporal differences between the SS and OS. Student's t-test, 
Bonferroni adjustment, Cohen's effect size, and quadratic regression were 
employed to analyse differences across walking speeds and groups.
RESULTS: A discrepancy between OS and SS was observed in 66.4% of the 
participants. Our findings revealed that the adjusted R² values for KSP at SS 
were consistently greater than those at OS, suggesting that SS offers a more 
robust and accurate representation of gait kinematics, whereas OS is less 
reliable.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of individualized speed 
selection in gait analysis, as it significantly impacts the accuracy of 
kinematic and spatiotemporal measurements. This insight is pivotal for 
clinicians and researchers to develop more effective rehabilitation strategies 
and comprehensively understand gait dynamics.

Humans adapt their locomotion seamlessly in response to changes in the body or 
the environment. It is unclear how such adaptation improves performance measures 
like energy consumption or symmetry while avoiding falling. Here, we model 
locomotor adaptation as interactions between a stabilizing controller that 
reacts quickly to perturbations and a reinforcement learner that gradually 
improves the controller's performance through local exploration and memory. This 
model predicts time-varying adaptation in many settings: walking on a split-belt 
treadmill (i.e. with both feet at different speeds), with asymmetric leg 
weights, or using exoskeletons - capturing learning and generalization phenomena 
in ten prior experiments and two model-guided experiments conducted here. The 
performance measure of energy minimization with a minor cost for asymmetry 
captures a broad range of phenomena and can act alongside other mechanisms such 
as reducing sensory prediction error. Such a model-based understanding of 
adaptation can guide rehabilitation and wearable robot control.

The perceived association between foot type and injury risk has inspired the 
development of many foot typing methods. The purpose of this study was to 
determine how well different foot typing methods explained variations in 
regional foot loading in asymptomatic adults during gait, while considering age, 
sex, and walking speed as covariates. Six methods were used to determine foot 
type in 92 asymptomatic adults. An insole pressure sensor system measured peak 
force and force-time integral during treadmill walking at a self-selected pace. 
The foot was divided into nine regions and the association between foot type and 
foot loading was analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) while 
accounting for the covariates. Over an average of 250 steps per individual, the 
results demonstrated variability in the association between regional foot 
loading and foot type. Specifically, Arch Index and X-Ray Arch Type correlated 
with hindfoot and midfoot loading, while Foot Posture Index correlated with 
medial midfoot, forefoot, and toe loading. Calcaneal Pitch and Meary's Angle 
correlated with medial hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot loading, while 
Varus/valgus angle correlated with loading in the forefoot and toes. The 
location and direction of associations were generally similar for Calcaneal 
Pitch, Meary's Angle, and X-Ray Arch Type, and opposite of Arch Index. The 
analyses demonstrated that walking speed, age, and sex were all important 
factors that affected the relationship between plantar loading and foot type. 
Specific foot type methods correlate better with loading in specific foot 
regions, potentially making them better to evaluate injury risk in those 
regions.

Individuals with lower limb impairment after a stroke or spinal cord injury 
require rehabilitation, but traditional methods can be challenging for both 
patients and therapists. Robotic systems have been developed to help; however, 
they currently cannot detect the continuous gait phase in real time, hindering 
their effectiveness. To address this limitation, researchers have attempted to 
develop gait phase detection in general using fuzzy logic algorithms and neural 
networks. However, there is a paucity of research on real-time and continuous 
gait phase detection. In light of this gap, we propose an unsupervised learning 
method for real-time and continuous gait phase detection. This method employs 
windows of real-time trajectories and a pre-trained model, utilizing 
trajectories from treadmill walking data, to detect the real-time and continuous 
gait phase of human on overground locomotion. The neural network model that we 
have developed exhibits an average time error of less than 11.51 ms across all 
walking conditions, indicating its suitability for real-time applications. 
Specifically, the average time error during overground walking at different 
speeds is 11.20 ms, which is comparatively lower than the average time error 
observed during treadmill walking, where it is 12.42 ms. By utilizing this 
method, we can predict the real-time phase using a pre-trained model from 
treadmill walking data collected with a full motion capture system, which can be 
performed in a laboratory setting, thereby eliminating the need for overground 
walking data, which can be more challenging to obtain due to the complexity of 
the setting.

Evidence supporting a link between gait and cognition is accumulating. However, 
the relation between executive functioning and spatiotemporal gait parameters 
has received little attention. This is surprising since these gait variables are 
related to falls. The goal of this preliminary study was to determine whether 
performance on measures of inhibition, reasoning, and fluency is related to 
variability in stride length and step width during dual-task treadmill walking 
in a sample of healthy adults. Nineteen healthy adults averaging 40 years of age 
were evaluated. Results indicated that processing speed was reduced, t(18) = 
6.31, p = 0.0001, step width increased, t(18) = -8.00, p = 0.0001, and stride 
length decreased, t(18) = 3.06, p = 0.007, while dual tasking, but variability 
in gait parameters did not significantly change, consistent with a 
gait/posture-first approach. As hypothesized, better performance on a visual 
design fluency task which assesses cognitive flexibility was associated with 
less dual-task stride length variability, rs (17) = -0.43, p = 0.034, and step 
width variability, r = -0.56, p = 0.006. The results extend previous findings 
with older adults walking over ground and additionally suggest that cognitive 
flexibility may be important for gait maintenance while dual tasking.

Running biomechanics have traditionally been analysed in laboratory settings, 
but this may not reflect natural running gait. Wearable technology has the 
potential to enable precise monitoring of running gait beyond the laboratory. 
This study aimed to evaluate the analytical validity and intra-session 
reliability of temporal running gait outcomes measured by the ViMove2 wearable 
system in healthy adults. Seventy-four healthy adults (43 males, 31 females, 
aged 18-55 years) wore the inertial device, ViMove2 on the tibia. Participants 
ran on a treadmill for one minute at various speeds (8, 10, 12, 14km/hr), 
completed in a standardised shoe (Saucony Guide Runner). Running gait was 
measured with the ViMove2 wearable and 3D motion capture (Vicon). Temporal 
running gait outcomes included ground contact time (GCT) and cadence 
(steps/min). GCT and cadence from the ViMove2 had face validity with expected 
changes in outcome with different running speeds, but ViMove2 tended to 
over-estimate GCT, and under-estimate cadence compared to the reference, 
especially at slower speeds. GCT demonstrated moderate to good agreement to the 
reference at speeds >10km/hr, but poor agreement at 8km/hr and within female 
runners. Cadence had moderate to excellent agreement across speeds compared to 
the reference. GCT and cadence had excellent reliability across speeds, but at 
8km/hr GCT had good agreement between trials. Overall, temporal gait outcomes of 
GCT and cadence can be measured with the ViMove2, but accuracy and reliability 
are impacted at slow running speeds and within female runners. Future work is 
needed to clarify sex or speed-dependent corrections to algorithms / outcomes to 
aid interpretation and application.

Gait retraining is a strategy to manage altered loading patterns and pain 
characteristic of knee osteoarthritis. Lower walking cadence is associated with 
higher knee joint loading, vertical ground reaction forces, and risk for 
cartilage worsening. Therefore, we determined the acute effects of increasing 
walking cadence on measures of lower extremity loading and knee pain in knee 
osteoarthritis. Twenty-five participants with knee osteoarthritis 
(age = 62.5 ± 7.2; 76.0 % female) walked at fixed speed on an instrumented 
treadmill from which baseline cadence was measured. Five, randomized 
experimental cadence conditions (2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 %, or 10 % over baseline 
cadence) were completed. Real-time auditory and visual feedback on cadence was 
provided while kinematics and ground reaction forces were sampled. Linear mixed 
effects models evaluated the effect of cadence on knee adduction and flexion 
moment peaks and impulses, impact loading metrics (vertical ground reaction 
force impact peak, vertical average and instantaneous loading rates), and knee 
pain. Increasing cadence by 2-10 % did not significantly change knee adduction 
moment peaks or impulse. Peak knee flexion moment increased by 3-32 % and knee 
flexion moment impulse reduced by 2-9 % with increases in cadence, but these 
results were not significant (peak knee flexion moment, p = 0.070; knee flexion 
moment impulse, p = 0.085). Increasing cadence significantly increased the 
vertical impact peak (p < 0.001), and the vertical average (p = 0.010), and 
instantaneous (p = 0.007) loading rates. Small increases in cadence at a fixed 
gait speed does not significantly change surrogate measures of knee joint 
loading or pain, but does increase measures of impact loading.

BACKGROUND: In this second section of our 2-part review on the role of physical 
activity (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in preventing and treating 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), we expand on topics covered in 
part 1, including a comparison of moderate-intensity continuous training versus 
high-intensity interval training, the beneficial role of PA and CRF in heart 
failure, potential mal-adaptations that may result from extreme endurance 
exercise regimens, and the incidence of cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death 
during marathon running and triathlon participation. Further, we review the 
principles of exercise prescription for patients with known or suspected CVD, 
with specific reference to exercise modalities, contemporary guidelines, the 
minimum exercise training intensity to promote survival benefits, and long-term 
goal training intensities, based on age-, sex-, and fitness-adjusted targets. 
Finally, we provide practical ""prescription pearls"" for the clinician, including 
a simple rule to estimate metabolic equivalents (METs) during level and graded 
treadmill walking, research-based exercise training recommendations, using steps 
per day, MET-minutes per week, and personal activity intelligence to achieve 
beneficial treatment outcomes, as well as the heart rate index equation to 
estimate energy expenditure, expressed as METs, during recreational and 
leisure-time PA.
SUMMARY: This review compares moderate-intensity continuous training and 
high-intensity interval training, examines the role of PA and CRF in managing 
heart failure, and discusses the cardiovascular risks associated with extreme 
endurance exercise. It also provides practical guidelines for exercise 
prescription tailored to patients with CVD, highlighting advanced exercise 
prescription strategies to optimize cardiovascular health.
KEY MESSAGES: Physicians and healthcare providers should prioritize referring 
patients to home-based or medically supervised exercise programs to leverage the 
cardioprotective benefits of regular PA. For most inactive patients, an exercise 
prescription is essential for improving overall health.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary 
effectiveness of implementing a home-based aerobic and resistance exercise for 
patients with breast cancer receiving endocrine treatment in Indonesia.
METHODS: This is a mixed methods study with concurrent design consisting of 
quantitative single-arm pre-post intervention and qualitative study. We 
recruited patients with breast cancer (N = 36) receiving endocrine treatment and 
assigned 12 weeks of home-based pedometer-driven walking and resistance 
exercises using therapeutic bands. Descriptive statistics were used to assess 
the feasibility (recruitment, retention, and adherence) and safety. The modified 
Bruce treadmill test was used to measure predicted aerobic capacity (V̇O2 peak). 
Quality of life and fatigue were assessed using the European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire and fatigue 
severity scale. Measurements were performed at baseline and post-intervention 
and analyzed with the paired t-test or Wilcoxon test. Semi-structured interviews 
and thematic analysis were conducted post-intervention to explore patients' 
acceptability.
RESULTS: The results showed a recruitment rate of 75%, retention rate of 89%, 
and adherence rates were 53% for aerobic and 78% for resistance exercise. No 
severe adverse events were reported. Post-intervention interviews identified 
positive attitudes toward the intervention, with low burden and high perceived 
benefit. Exercise duration and predicted V̇O2 peak increased significantly 
(+1.1 min, p = 0.001 and +2.3 ml/kg/min, p = 0.043), but no significant change 
was detected for Quality of Life (p > 0.050) or fatigue severity (p = 0.299).
CONCLUSIONS: A home-based aerobic and resistance exercise was feasible when 
implemented in the context of routine care in our study population, improving 
predicted aerobic capacity. Further research is required to understand limited 
changes to Quality of Life and fatigue and adaptations to support implementation 
in additional sites in Indonesia.

BACKGROUND: The ability to relearn a lost skill is critical to motor recovery 
after a stroke. Previous studies indicate that stroke typically affects the 
processes underlying motor control and execution but not the learning of those 
skills. However, these studies could be confounded by the presence of 
significant motor impairments. Furthermore, prior research involving the upper 
extremity indicates that stroke survivors have an advantage in offline motor 
learning when compared with controls. However, this has not been examined using 
motor acuity tasks (i.e., tasks focusing on the quality of executed actions) 
that have direct functional relevance to rehabilitation.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate how stroke affects leg motor skill learning during 
walking in stroke survivors.
METHODS: Twenty-five participants (10 stroke; 15 controls) were recruited for 
this prospective, case-control study. Participants learned a novel 
foot-trajectory tracking task on two consecutive days while walking on a 
treadmill. The task necessitated greater hip and knee flexion during the swing 
phase of the gait. Online learning was measured by comparing tracking error at 
the beginning and end of each practice session, offline (rest-driven) learning 
was measured by comparing the end of the first practice session to the beginning 
of the second, and retention was measured by comparing the beginning of the 
first practice session to the beginning of the second. Online learning, offline 
learning, and retention were compared between the stroke survivors and uninjured 
controls.
RESULTS: Stroke survivors improved their tracking performance on the first day 
(p = 0.033); however, the amount of learning in stroke survivors was lower in 
comparison with the control group on both days (p ≤ 0.05). Interestingly, stroke 
survivors showed higher offline learning gains when compared with uninjured 
controls (p = 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: Even stroke survivors with no perceivable motor impairments have 
difficulty acquiring new motor skills related to walking, which may be related 
to the underlying neural damage caused at the time of stroke. Furthermore, 
stroke survivors may require longer training with adequate rest to acquire new 
motor skills.

Intermittent claudication is a primary symptom of peripheral artery disease 
(PAD). a chronic progressive disease caused primarily by atherosclerosis. It is 
usually characterized by leg pain, aches, cramps, or fatigue when walking, which 
improves with rest. Physical therapy, including a supervised exercise program, 
is often recommended as the first treatment for sprains. This study aims to 
evaluate the short-term effects of incorporating heel raise and calf stretch 
exercises with standard medical therapy compared to medical therapy alone in 
managing intermittent claudication. From May 2022 to November 2023, 160 patients 
with Stage II Fontaine PAD were randomly assigned to two equal groups. Group A 
(80 patients) received heel raise and calf stretch exercises in addition to 
medical treatment, while Group B (80 patients) received only medical treatment. 
Both groups underwent treadmill walking tests before and after three months to 
measure absolute walking distance (ACD), peak walking time (PWT), and Walking 
Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) scores, including distance, speed, and symptom 
severity. At baseline, there were no significant differences between the groups 
in terms of ACD, peak walking time, ankle-brachial index, distance, speed, and 
symptoms. At follow-up, Group A showed significantly greater improvements in ACD 
(312.00 ± 45.43 m), peak walking time (8.54 ± 1.55 min), distance 
(29.46 ± 4.63 km), speed (20.01 ± 3.13 kph), and WIQ symptoms (22.10 ± 1.02) 
compared to Group B, which had ACD (276.55 ± 29.07 m), peak walking time 
(6.72 ± 1.70 min), distance (23.68 ± 3.89 km), speed (15.71 ± 2.71 kph), and WIQ 
symptoms (20.80 ± 1.47) (P < .001). The ankle-brachial index remained similar 
between the groups (P > .05). We concluded that integrating standard physical 
therapy exercises, such as calf raises and leg stretches, with medical therapy 
significantly enhances walking function in patients with ischemic intermittent 
claudication.

BACKGROUND: The process of aging often accompanies a decline in cognitive 
function, postural control, and gait stability, consequently increasing the 
susceptibility to falls among older individuals. In response to these 
challenges, motor-cognitive training has emerged as a potential intervention to 
mitigate age-related declines.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the acute effects of two distinct 
motor-cognitive training modalities, treadmill dual-task training (TMDT) and 
interactive motor-cognitive training (IMCT), on cognitive function, postural 
control, walking ability, and dual-task performance in the elderly population.
METHOD: In this randomized crossover study, 35 healthy elderly individuals (aged 
60-75) participated in three acute training sessions involving TMDT, IMCT, and a 
control reading condition. Assessments of executive function, postural control, 
gait performance, and cognitive accuracy were conducted both before and after 
each session.
RESULTS: Both TMDT and IMCT improved executive functions. Notably, IMCT resulted 
in a significant enhancement in correct response rates and a reduction in 
reaction times in the Stroop task (p < 0.05) compared to TMDT and the control 
condition. IMCT also led to an increase in dual-task gait speed (p < 0.001) and 
showed a trend towards improved cognitive accuracy (p = 0.07). Conversely, TMDT 
increased postural sway with eyes open (p = 0.013), indicating a potential 
detriment to postural control.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that IMCT holds greater immediate efficacy in 
enhancing cognitive function and gait stability among older adults compared to 
TMDT, with a lesser adverse impact on postural control. This underscores the 
potential of IMCT as a preferred approach for mitigating fall risk and enhancing 
both cognitive and physical functions in the elderly population.

BACKGROUND: Muscular synergies could represent the patterns of muscular 
activation used by the central nervous system (CNS) to simplify the production 
of movement. Studies in walking-running transitions described up to nine synergy 
modules, and an earlier activation of flexor and extension ankle muscular groups 
compared to running or walking. Our project aims to study the behaviour of 
muscle synergies in different stance and swing variations of walking-running 
(WRT) and running-walking (RWT) transitions.
METHODS: Twenty-four trained men participated in this study. A variable speed 
protocol on a treadmill was developed to record the activity of 14 muscle during 
walking, running and relative transitions. The protocol was based on five ramps 
of 50 seconds each around ± 10 and 20% of the WRT speed. WRT and RWT were 
identified according to an abrupt change of the duty factor. Analysing surface 
electromyography using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) we obtained 
synergy modules and temporal activation profiles. Alpha threshold for 
statistical tests set at 0.05.
RESULTS: We described four different transition strides, two for increasing 
speed transitions, and two for decreasing speed transitions. Four to six synergy 
modules were found in each condition. According to the maximum cosine similarity 
results, the two identified WRT conditions shared five modules, while the two 
RWT conditions shared four modules. WRT and RWT overall shared 4.33 ± 0.58 
modules. The activation profiles and centres of activation revealed differences 
among conditions.
DISCUSSION: Transition occurred at step level, and transition strides were 
composed by walk-like and run-like steps. Compared with previous studies in 
running and walking, both transitions needed earlier activation of a comparable 
number of synergy modules. Synergies were affected by acceleration: during RWT 
the need to dissipate energy, to decrease the speed, was achieved by increasing 
the number of co-activating muscles. This was reflected in fewer synergy modules 
and different activation profiles compared to WRT. We believe that our results 
could be enforced in different applied fields, like clinical gait analysis, 
physiotherapy and rehabilitation, where plans including co-activation of 
specific muscular groups could be useful. Gait transitions are common in 
different sports, and therefore also application in training and sport science 
would be possible.

We maintain balance during gait using both proactive and reactive control 
strategies. Damage to the brain from a stroke impairs reactive balance, but 
little is known about how a stroke impacts proactive control during walking. 
Identifying stroke-related impairments to proactive control could inform the 
design of interventions to improve balance and reduce fall risk. Therefore, we 
determined if people with and without stroke differ in their ability to use 
proactive strategies during predictable treadmill accelerations. Groups of 14 
adults with and without stroke walked with single-belt accelerations at random 
(every one to five strides) and regular (every three strides) intervals. We 
quantified the effects of the perturbations as changes to center of mass (COM) 
speed and used mechanical leg work to quantify the proactive strategies to slow 
the COM. Participants without stroke reduced peak COM speed better than those 
with stroke when perturbations were at regular intervals (-0.023 versus -0.001 
m/s; p=0.007). They also reduced positive leg work more during the perturbation 
step than the group post-stroke (-7.7% versus -1.9%; p=0.004). Together, these 
results demonstrate that the sensorimotor impairments resulting from a stroke 
impair the ability to generate effective proactive adjustments to reduce the 
destabilizing effects of predictable perturbations.

This study aims to investigate the influence of a new semi-rigid knee joint 
braces on kinematics using the Opti-knee knee joint kinematic analysis system at 
various exercise speeds. Twenty-four healthy young male adults were recruited 
for this study. Participants were randomly assessed while wearing and not 
wearing knee brace at four different speeds on a treadmill: normal walking (3.6 
km/h), brisk walking (5.4 km/h), jogging (9 km/h), and moderate intensity 
running (10.8 km/h). Six degrees of freedom kinematic data from the knee joint 
were collected. Paired t-tests were conducted to calculate the kinematic 
differences. At speeds of 3.6 km/h and 5.4 km/h, wearing the knee brace led to 
reduced knee joint mobility in anterior-posterior translation, superior-inferior 
translation, internal-external rotation, and flexion-extension angles during the 
stance phase (P < 0.05). At 9 km/h, wearing the brace reduced knee joint 
internal-external rotation and flexion-extension mobility during the stance 
phase (P < 0.05). At 10.8 km/h, wearing the brace reduced knee joint 
flexion-extension mobility during the stance phase (P < 0.05). Wearing brace has 
significant influence on knee kinematics at four speeds, and the effect of brace 
varies with the speed of movement.

Lower limb exoskeletons represent a relevant tool for rehabilitating gait in 
patients with lower limb movement disorders. Partial assistance exoskeletons 
adaptively provide the joint torque needed, on top of that produced by the 
patient, for a correct and stable gait, helping the patient to recover an 
autonomous gait. Thus, the device needs to identify the different phases of the 
gait cycle to produce precisely timed commands that drive its joint motors 
appropriately. In this study, EMG signals have been used for gait phase 
detection considering that EMG activations lead limb kinematics by at least 120 
ms. We propose a deep learning model based on bidirectional LSTM to identify 
stance and swing gait phases from EMG data. We built a dataset of EMG signals 
recorded at 1500 Hz from four muscles from the dominant leg in a population of 
26 healthy subjects walking overground (WO) and walking on a treadmill (WT) 
using a lower limb exoskeleton. The data were labeled with the corresponding 
stance or swing gait phase based on limb kinematics provided by inertial motion 
sensors. The model was studied in three different scenarios, and we explored its 
generalization abilities and evaluated its applicability to the online 
processing of EMG data. The training was always conducted on 500-sample 
sequences from WO recordings of 23 subjects. Testing always involved WO and WT 
sequences from the remaining three subjects. First, the model was trained and 
tested on 500 Hz EMG data, obtaining an overall accuracy on the WO and WT test 
datasets of 92.43% and 91.16%, respectively. The simulation of online operation 
required 127 ms to preprocess and classify one sequence. Second, the trained 
model was evaluated against a test set built on 1500 Hz EMG data. The accuracies 
were lower, yet the processing times were 11 ms faster. Third, we partially 
retrained the model on a subset of the 1500 Hz training dataset, achieving 
87.17% and 89.64% accuracy on the 1500 Hz WO and WT test sets, respectively. 
Overall, the proposed deep learning model appears to be a valuable candidate for 
entering the control pipeline of a lower limb rehabilitation exoskeleton in 
terms of both the achieved accuracy and processing times.

The biomechanics of walking are far less understood for uneven terrain than flat 
or even surfaces. This is due in part to a lack of ground reaction force and 
moment recordings from each leg. These are often obtained with split-belt 
instrumented treadmills, which are currently incompatible with uneven terrain, 
making it difficult to perform biomechanics analyses such as inverse dynamics. 
Here we show how a standard split-belt instrumented treadmill (Bertec, Inc., 
Columbus, OH) can be modified to accommodate a variety of uneven terrains. The 
principal design considerations are structural clearance to allow passage of an 
uneven treadmill belt and fabrication of the terrain. We designed mechanical 
components with sufficient clearance for terrains up to 0.045 m high, and formed 
the terrain from uneven strips of polystyrene. Measured ground reaction forces 
from each leg at typical walking speeds agreed well with an intact benchmark 
treadmill (minimum interclass cross correlation score = 0.97). The modifications 
had negligible effect on the treadmill's structural strength. The terrain 
produced some noise-like vibrations, but at much higher frequencies than 
fundamental to human locomotion. The uneven terrain treadmill can record many 
steps of the full complement of ground reaction forces and moments from 
individual legs.

Thigh-worn accelerometry is commonly implemented to measure step cadence. The 
default activPAL CREA algorithm is a valid measure of cadence during walking, 
but its validity during running is unknown. The ActiPASS software is designed to 
analyse tri-axial accelerometry data from various brands. We tested the validity 
of CREA v1.3 and ActiPASS 2023.12 to measure step cadence against 
manually-counted steps. Forty-five participants (26♀, 23.4 ± 4.6 years) 
completed 5 walking (6 min each, 2-4 mph) and 5 running treadmill (5-7 mph) 
stages (423 total stages completed). Based on equivalence testing, walking 
cadence (stages 1-5: 92-124 steps/min) from CREA was statistically equivalent 
(zone: <±2.2% of the manually-counted mean) to manual counts (92-125 steps/min). 
However, CREA underpredicted cadence during running stages (stages 6-10: 143-135 
steps/min) by ~ 11-20 steps/min (p < 0.001). The ActiPASS-derived cadences were 
equivalent (zone: <±3.3%) to manual counts for all walking stages (99-127 
steps/min) except Stage 1 (zone: ±10.5%). ActiPASS underpredicted cadences 
during running (stages 6-10: 137-153 steps/min) by ~ 10-16 steps/min (p < 0.001) 
compared to manual counts (stages 6-10: 154-164 steps/min). The CREA v1.3 
algorithm is a valid measure of cadence during walking while ActiPASS 2023.12 is 
a valid measure of cadence during medium-fast walking. Further research is 
required to improve step cadence estimation across ambulation speeds.

Dual cognitive-walking treadmill training (DTT), designed to replicate real-life 
walking conditions, has shown promise effect in individuals with Parkinson's 
disease (PD). This study aims to compare the effects of DTT versus single 
treadmill training (STT) on cognitive and walking performance under both single 
and dual task conditions, as well as on fall, patients' subjective feeling, and 
quality of life. Sixteen individuals with PD were randomly assigned to DTT or 
STT group and underwent 8 weeks of training. The DTT group received treadmill 
training with cognitive loads, while the STT group received treadmill training 
without cognitive load. Outcome measures included gait parameters (speed, step 
length) and cognitive performance (reaction time, accuracy, composite score) 
under both single and dual task conditions. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating 
Scale-part III (UPDRS-III), Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), Patient Global 
Impression of Change (PGIC), and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) were 
also measured. Both DTT and STT groups showed increased comfortable walking 
speed and step length. Only the DTT group demonstrated significant improvements 
in cognitive composite score under both single and dual task conditions, as well 
as UPDRS-III, FES, and PDQ-39(p < 0.05). DTT can enhance cognitive function 
without compromising walking ability and also have real-world transferability.

OBJECTIVE: Ambulatory venous pressure (AVP) is the drop of pressure observed in 
the superficial veins of the lower leg during movement. This phenomenon has been 
linked to the function of the calf muscle pump (CMP) and the competence of 
venous valves. Nevertheless, the concept of the CMP function remains 
controversial. This study aimed to elucidate the association between lower leg 
muscles activity, changes in pressure in distinct venous segments, and lower 
extremity arterial blood supply in healthy subjects during various types and 
intensities of exercise.
METHODS: Twelve legs of nine healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. 
Continuous pressure (intramuscular vein [IV] and three great saphenous vein 
[GSV] points) and surface electromyography data (gastrocnemius and anterior 
tibial [ATM] muscles) were recorded during treadmill walking, running, and 
plantar flexion exercises. The pressure gradient (ΔP, mmHg) between adjacent 
points of measurement was calculated. Minute unit power of muscle pump ejection 
and suction (NE, and NS, MPa/min) were calculated and compared with the arterial 
blood supply of the lower extremity (LBF, L/min).
RESULTS: ΔP demonstrated a consistent pattern of changes during walking and 
running. In GSV, the ΔP was observed to be directed from the thigh to the 
mid-calf (retrogradely) and from the ankle to the mid-calf (anterogradely) 
throughout the entire stride cycle. However, its value decreased with increasing 
stride cycle frequency. The dynamics of ΔP between the IV and GSV were as 
follows: It was directed from the IV to GSV during gastrocnemius contraction and 
was reversed during anterior tibial muscle contraction and gastrocnemius 
relaxation (swing phase). LBF, NE, and NS demonstrated similar exponential 
growth with increasing stride frequency during walking and running.
CONCLUSIONS: During natural locomotion, the muscle pump acts as a flow diverter 
pump, redirecting the flow of blood from the superficial veins to the 
intramuscular veins via the perforating veins. During ambulation, the pressure 
in the superficial venous network depends upon the capacity of the muscle pump 
to provide output that matches the changes in arterial blood flow.

Understanding the intricacies of human movement coordination and variability 
during running is crucial to unraveling the dynamics of locomotion, identifying 
potential injury mechanisms and understanding skill development. Identification 
of minimum number of cycles for calculation of reliable coordination and its 
variability could help with better test organization and efficient assessment 
time. By adopting a cross-sectional study design, this study investigated the 
minimum required cycles for calculating hip-knee, hip-ankle and knee-ankle 
coordination and their variability using a continuous relative phase (CRP) 
method. Twenty-nine healthy adults ran on a treadmill at speeds of 9, 12.5, and 
16 km.h-1 while 3D kinematic data of their lower limbs were recorded using 6 
optoelectronic cameras. Using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) analysis, 
reliability between CRP and its variability (CRPv) in different gait cycles (3, 
5, 10, 20, 30) was assessed for each speed. A minimum of 10 cycles was required 
for CRP calculation across all speeds, whereas CRPv necessitated a minimum of 30 
cycles for moderate to good reliability. While increasing the number of cycles 
improved ICC values for inter-joint CRP, the same trend was not consistently 
observed for CRPv, emphasizing the importance of separately assessing CRP and 
its variability metrics.

While monitoring physiological strain is recommended to safeguard workers during 
heat exposure, it is logistically challenging. The perceptual strain index 
(PeSI) is a subjective estimate thought to reflect the physiological strain 
index (PSI) that requires no direct monitoring. However, advanced age and 
chronic diseases (hypertension/type 2 diabetes [T2D]) influence the perception 
of heat stress, potentially limiting the utility of the PeSI. We therefore 
assessed whether the relation and agreement between the PeSI and PSI during 
simulated work in various environmental conditions is modified by age and 
T2D/hypertension. Thirteen young adults and 37 older adults without (n = 14) and 
with T2D (n = 10) or hypertension (n = 13) walked on a treadmill (∼200 W/m2) for 
180 min or until termination (volitional fatigue, rectal temperature ≥39.5 °C) 
in 16, 24, 28, and 32 °C wet-bulb globe temperatures. Rectal temperature and 
heart rate were recorded to calculate PSI (0-10 scale). Rating of perceived 
exertion and thermal sensation were recorded to calculate PeSI (0-10 scale). The 
relation between hourly PSI and PeSI was assessed via linear mixed models. Mean 
bias (95% limits of agreement [LoA]) between PSI and PeSI was assessed via 
Bland-Altman analysis. PSI increased with PeSI (p < 0.001), but the slope of 
this relation was not different between young and older adults (p = 0.189) or as 
a function of chronic disease (within older adults; p = 0.183). The mean bias 
between PSI and PeSI was small (0.02), but the 95% LoA was wide (-3.3-3.4). 
Together, a linear relation between PeSI and PSI was observed but agreement 
between these measures varied considerably across individuals and thus PeSI 
should not be used as a surrogate marker of PSI. Caution should be taken when 
utilizing the PeSI to estimate physiological strain on workers.

Gait adaptability is crucial for meeting environmental demands, and impaired 
gait adaptation increases fall risk, particularly in older adults. While prior 
research exists on older adults' gait adaptation, particularly in perturbation 
studies, the specific contributions of temporal and spatial adaptation 
strategies to step length asymmetry (SLA) during split-belt treadmill walking 
require further examination. This study fills this gap by evaluating how 
distinct adaptation strategies contribute to SLA in healthy young and older 
adults. 19 healthy young adults (20.4 ± 1.1 years) and 19 healthy older adults 
(68.3 ± 8.1 years) walked on a split-belt treadmill requiring their non-dominant 
leg to move twice as fast as their dominant leg. Repeated measures ANOVA 
investigated (1) spatial and temporal contributions to SLA, (2) SLA across gait 
adaptation epochs, and (3) rates of adaptation and deadaptation. Older adults 
displayed reduced temporal contributions to SLA compared to younger adults 
(F1,36 = 6.42, p = .02, ŋ2 = .15), but no group differences were observed in 
spatial contributions to SLA (F1,36 = 3.23, p = .08, ŋ2 = .082). SLA during 
adaptation and deadaptation did not differ by age group, nor did the rate of 
adaptation (F1,34.7 = 0.594, p = .45) or deadaptation F1,33.6 = 2.886, p = .09). 
These findings suggest that while older adults rely less on temporal strategies 
for gait adaptation, but maintain overall adaptability comparable to younger 
adults. Findings enhance our understanding of age-related changes in gait 
adaptation mechanisms and may inform targeted interventions to improve gait 
adaptability in older populations.

INTRODUCTION: IMU sensors (three-dimensional accelerometer, gyroscope and 
magnetometer) enable assessment of walking in older adults outside the 
laboratory. We studied whether IMUs are valid for detecting walking parameters 
(step events, time, length, and cadence) in a laboratory and outdoors on a level 
surface in older adults.
METHODS: This validation study is part of a larger cross-sectional study. 
Twenty-six participants (mean age 76 years, 65 % female) walked on a treadmill 
indoors and on a sport track outdoors at self-selected speed. IMUs were attached 
laterally on the shanks and on the lower back at the level of L3-L4. Initial 
contact (IC) and step lengths were also estimated using acceleration signals 
(vertical, antero-posterior) from the pelvic IMU. Terminal contact (TC) was 
determined from the shank IMU sagittal angular velocity. For step length, 
inverted pendulum model and participant's leg length (0.53 x height) was used. 
Step duration was calculated from IC to the opposite leg IC and stride duration 
from IC to next ipsilateral IC. Cadence was calculated as steps/min. As 
reference data, 3D motion capture was used in the laboratory and a high-speed 
video camera outdoors. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), root mean 
squared errors (RMSE), typical errors and Bland-Altman plots were calculated and 
drawn.
RESULTS: When comparing IC timing between IMU and reference data, mean bias was 
0.031 s in the laboratory and -0.004 s outdoors, and for TC -0.057 s and 
-0.070 s respectively. Step and stride duration and cadence showed ICC values 
>0.80 and mean bias was <0.005 s for step and stride durations and <0.05 
steps/min for cadence in both environments. Step length ICC values were <0.40 in 
the laboratory and outdoors.
SIGNIFICANCE: IMUs can be used to monitor temporal walking variables in older 
adults and may be useful for rehabilitation interventions and functional 
capacity assessment.

INTRODUCTION: Balance and gait impairments are common in people with hereditary 
spastic paraplegia (HSP) and often result in falls. Measures that identify 
patients at risk of falling are clinically relevant, but relatively unexplored 
in HSP. Here, we evaluated the potential of different balance and gait 
constructs to (1) identify differences between healthy controls and people with 
HSP and (2) discriminate between fallers and non-fallers with HSP.
METHODS: We included 33 people with pure-HSP and 15 healthy controls. We 
assessed balance confidence (six-item Activities-specific Balance Confidence 
scale), clinical balance capacity (Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test) and 
gait capacity (ten-meter Walk Test). Biomechanical measures included 
spatiotemporal gait variability, mediolateral Margin of Stability (MoS), Foot 
Placement Deviation (FPD), and Local Divergence Exponents (LDEs) of trunk and 
pelvis, derived from treadmill-walking at comfortable and fixed gait speeds. 
People with HSP logged their falls during a fifteen-week period and were 
categorized as 'faller' (≥1 fall) or 'non-faller'.
RESULTS: People with HSP had significantly lower balance confidence, balance 
capacity, and gait capacity compared to age-matched controls. People with HSP 
also showed reduced gait stability, reflected by increased spatiotemporal gait 
variability, FPD, and LDEs of trunk and pelvis. Overall, 44 % of people with HSP 
were categorized as 'faller'. Balance confidence (AUC:0.84) and balance capacity 
(AUC:0.75) discriminated fallers from non-fallers, whereas none of the 
biomechanical measures significantly differed.
CONCLUSION: Balance confidence, clinical balance and gait capacity, and 
biomechanical measures are affected in HSP, but clinical measures showed 
potential to differentiate fallers from non-fallers in people with HSP.

BACKGROUND: Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and sample entropy (SE) measure 
the long-term correlations and regularity of gait patterns, respectively, having 
previously been used to identify participants at risk of falling, previous 
history of injury, or patients with motor diseases. Since these measures are 
more sensitive to gait impairment than linear measures (e.g., the standard 
deviation [SD] of stride time), they can be potentially used in military 
medicine to identify soldiers at risk of injury. However, clinometric properties 
are yet to be established.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the repeatability of DFA, SE, and traditional linear 
measures of stride time variability (SD and coefficient of variation [CV]) under 
various load and speed constraints?
METHODS: Fourteen Australian Army trainee soldiers (age: 25.6 ± 5.9 y, height: 
1.74 ± 0.08 m, body mass: 77.2 ± 15.1 kg, service: 1.5 ± 1.8 y) attended three 
sessions over two weeks, completing four 12-minute walking trials on an 
instrumented treadmill in each session. Participants walked with a combination 
of 0 kg or 23 kg loads at a self-selected or 5.5 km/h speed. Heel contacts from 
the right foot were identified using treadmill-embedded force plates. From 512 
stride time intervals, linear (SD and CV), and non-linear (DFA and SE) measures 
were obtained. To assess the between-session repeatability, intraclass 
correlations (ICC 2,1) were employed.
RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE: There was poor-to-moderate repeatability for the SD 
(ICC: 0.357-0.545) and CV (ICC: 0.371-0.529). DFA showed poor-to-moderate 
repeatability (ICC: 0.013-0.504), while SE had poor repeatability (ICC: 
0.133-0.226). Previous studies have shown that differences of > 0.19 in DFA and 
> 0.66 in SE can differentiate between healthy and pathological gait. These 
values are greater than this study's reported standard error of measurement, 
indicating that clinically meaningful changes may still be detectable despite 
low repeatability.

BACKGROUND: People with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) suffer 
from a high burden of symptoms and significant functional impairment. There are 
few therapies that improve function and reduce symptoms in this population. 
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been shown to improve 
glycaemic control, reduce body weight, and reduce the risk of major adverse 
cardiovascular events in people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 
type 2 diabetes (T2D).
METHODS AND RESULTS: STRIDE (NCT04560998) is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind phase 3b trial evaluating 1 mg once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 
(GLP-1 RA) vs. placebo, in people with symptomatic PAD (Fontaine IIa 
claudication) and T2D. Eligible participants were ≥18 years, had 
haemodynamically stable PAD, had no planned intervention, and were not receiving 
a GLP-1 RA. The primary endpoint is change in maximum walking distance on a 
constant-load treadmill (CLT). Secondary endpoints include quality of life and 
cardiometabolic assessments. A total of 792 participants were randomized in 20 
countries. Participants' median age was 68 and median T2D duration 12 years. 
Risk factors included 25.6% current smokers, 87.9% with hypertension, and 42.7% 
with coronary heart disease. The mean BMI was 29.6 kg/m2 and the mean HbA1C was 
7.3%. Participants exhibited baseline functional impairment with a median 
maximum walking distance of 186 m on a CLT.
CONCLUSION: STRIDE has enrolled participants with symptomatic PAD and T2D, 
frequent risk factors and comorbidities, and functional impairment. The trial 
will provide evidence for the functional outcomes with semaglutide in people 
with PAD and T2D.

Individuals with neurological impairments often exhibit asymmetrical gait 
patterns. This study explored the potential of using functional electrical 
stimulation (FES) as a perturbation method during treadmill walking to promote 
gait symmetry adaptation by investigating whether the FES perturbation could 
induce gait adaptation concerning spatial and temporal gait symmetry in healthy 
subjects. In the FES perturbation, both legs received electrical pulses at the 
same period as the subjects' initial stride duration, and the temporal gap 
between the two pulses for each leg was manipulated over a 7-min period. 
Following this, subjects continued to walk for another 5 minutes without FES. 
Subjects participated in two trials: implicit and explicit. In the implicit 
trial, they walked comfortably during FES perturbation without consciously 
adjusting their gait. In the explicit trial, they voluntarily synchronized their 
toe-off phase to the stimulation timing. To examine the effects of the FES 
perturbation, we measured step length and stance time and then analyzed changes 
in step length and stance time symmetries alongside their subsequent 
aftereffects. During the explicit trial, subjects adapted their gait patterns to 
the electrical pulses, resulting in a directional change in stance time 
(temporal) symmetry, with the left stance becoming shorter than the right. The 
stance time asymmetry induced by FES perturbation showed a slight residual 
effect. In the implicit trial, the directional change trend was slightly 
observed but not statistically significant. No consistent trend in step length 
(spatial) symmetry changes was observed in either condition, indicating that 
subjects may adapt their spatial gait patterns independently of their temporal 
patterns. Our findings suggest that the applied FES perturbation strategy under 
explicit condition can induce adaptations in subjects' temporal gait asymmetry, 
particularly in stance. The implicit condition showed a similar slight trend but 
was not statistically significant. Further experiments would provide deeper 
understanding into the mechanism behind subjects' response to FES perturbations, 
as well as the long-term effects of these perturbations on the spatial and 
temporal aspects of gait symmetry.

Upon visually detecting a moving predator, animals often freeze, i.e. stop 
moving, to minimize being uncovered and to gather detailed information of the 
object's movements and properties. In certain conditions, the freezing behavior 
can be enough to avoid a predatory menace but, when the risk is high or 
increases to a higher level, animals switch strategy and engage in an escape 
response. The neural bases underlying escape responses to visual stimuli have 
been extensively investigated both in vertebrates and arthropods. However, those 
involved in freezing behaviors are much less studied. Here, we investigated the 
freezing behavior displayed by the crab Neohelice granulata when confronted with 
a variety of looming stimuli simulating objects of distinct sizes approaching on 
a collision course at different speeds. The experiments were performed in a 
treadmill-like device. Animals engaged in exploratory walks responded to the 
looming stimulus with freezing followed by escaping. The analysis of the 
stimulus optical variables shows that regardless of the looming dynamic, the 
freezing decision is made when the angular size of the object increases by 
1.4 deg. In vivo intracellular recording responses of monostratified lobula 
giant neurons (MLG1) to the same looming stimuli show that the freezing times 
correlate with the times predicted by a hypothetical spike counter of this 
neuron.

Walking is a fundamental aspect of daily life and exercise, with clinical 
benefits for cardiovascular health and muscle strength. However, accurately 
measuring energy efficiency during walking poses challenges due to equipment and 
spatial constraints. In this study, we proposed the cadence-based energy 
expenditure index (cEEI) and analyzed its correlation with the previously 
proposed index for measuring energy expenditure under various gait conditions. 
We enrolled 15 healthy participants and conducted an experimental protocol on a 
treadmill to measure the following energy expenditure-related indices: oxygen 
cost index (OCI), energy expenditure index (EEI), and cEEI. The participants 
underwent stages of walking at different speeds and inclinations that comply 
with the modified Bruce protocol, whereas their heart rate, oxygen uptake, and 
cadence were recorded. Participants showed significant increases in heart rate, 
oxygen uptake, and cadence with higher walking speeds and inclinations. 
Correlation analysis revealed strong associations between cEEI and OCI, 
especially during walking conditions. Bland-Altman plots and interclass 
correlation coefficient analysis demonstrated a favorable agreement between cEEI 
and OCI, outperforming EEI. In conclusion, this study proposes cEEI as a 
reliable metric for estimating energy expenditure during walking by proving a 
strong correlation and agreement with OCI across various gait conditions. This 
suggests the potential for cEEI to provide real-time, individualized feedback on 
energy expenditure during walking, facilitating more personalized exercise 
prescriptions.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We proposed cEEI as a reliable metric for 
estimating energy expenditure under various walking conditions. Its demonstrated 
accuracy and potential for real-time individualized feedback could revolutionize 
personalized exercise prescriptions for diverse sexes and age groups, as well as 
individuals with disabilities requiring real-time physical monitoring and home 
care.

The metabolic cost of steady-state walking is well known; however, across legged 
animals, most walking bouts are too short to reach steady state. Here, we 
investigate how bout duration affects the metabolic cost of human walking with 
varying mechanical power, metabolic intensity and duration. Ten participants 
walked for 10- to 240-s bouts on a stair climber at 0.20, 0.25 and 0.36 m s-1 
and on a treadmill at 1.39 m s-1. Oxygen uptake was time-integrated and divided 
by bout duration to get bout average uptake (V̇O2(b)). Fitting of oxygen uptake 
kinetics allowed calculating non-metabolic oxygen exchange during phase-I 
transient and, hence, non-steady-state metabolic cost (C met(b)) and efficiency. 
For 240-s bouts, such variables were also calculated at steady state. Across all 
conditions, shorter bouts had higher V̇O2(b) and C met(b), with proportionally 
greater non-metabolic oxygen exchange. As the bout duration increased, V̇O2(b), 
C met(b) and efficiency approached steady-state values. Our findings show that 
the time-averaged oxygen uptake and metabolic cost are greater for shorter than 
longer bouts: 30-s bouts consume 20-60% more oxygen than steady-state 
extrapolations. This is partially explained by the proportionally greater 
non-metabolic oxygen uptake and leads to lower efficiency for shorter bouts. 
Inferring metabolic cost from steady state substantially underestimates energy 
expenditure for short bouts.

Occupational heat stress increases acute kidney injury risk. Drinking a soft 
drink sweetened with high fructose corn syrup further elevates this acute kidney 
injury risk. However, the impact of sucrose, another fructose-containing 
sweetener, on acute kidney injury risk remains unexplored. We tested the 
hypothesis that drinking a sucrose-containing sports drink increases acute 
kidney injury risk when compared to drinking a sugar-free sports drink during 4 
h of simulated occupational heat stress. Ten healthy adults consumed a 
sucrose-containing or sugar-free sport drink ad libitum during 4 h exposures to 
wet bulb globe temperatures of ∼28 °C. Thirty min of work and 30 min of rest 
were completed each hour. Work involved treadmill walking at a fixed rate of 
metabolic heat production (sucrose-containing: 6.0 ± 1.2 W/kg, sugar-free: 
5.5 ± 0.9 W/kg, p = 0.267). The product of urinary insulin-like growth 
factor-binding protein 7 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, normalized 
to urine specific gravity ([IGFBP7·TIMP-2]USG), provided an acute kidney injury 
risk index. Mean core (intestinal: n = 13, rectal: n = 7) temperature 
(sucrose-containing: 37.5 ± 0.1 °C, sugar-free: 37.5 ± 0.3 °C; p = 0.914), peak 
core temperature (sucrose-containing: 37.8 ± 0.2 °C, sugar-free: 37.9 ± 0.3 °C; 
p = 0.398), and percent changes in body mass (sucrose-containing: -0.5 ± 0.4%, 
sugar-free: -0.3 ± 0.6%; p = 0.386) did not differ between groups. 
[IGFBP7∙TIMP-2]USG increased in both groups (time effect: p = 0.025) with no 
drink (p = 0.675) or interaction (p = 0.715) effects. Peak change 
[IGFBP7∙TIMP-2]USG did not differ between sucrose-containing (median 0.0116 
[-0.0012, 0.1760] (ng/mL)2/1000) and sugar-free (median 0.0021 [0.0003, 0.2077] 
(ng/mL)2/1000; p = 0.796). Sucrose-containing sports drink consumption during 
simulated occupational heat stress does not modify acute kidney injury risk when 
compared to sugar free-sport drink consumption.

Walking is a common and preferred form of exercise. Although there are current 
recommendations for walking volume (e.g., steps per day), recent research has 
begun to distinguish volume from intensity (e.g., ""brisk"" walking) as an 
important dimension of exercise. Increasing intensity may confer health 
advantages beyond volume measures because it shifts cardiovascular performance 
to more vigorous training zones. Reinforcement-based approaches have been 
valuable in increasing volume measures of exercise, and the present study sought 
to develop a corresponding reinforcement approach to training walking intensity. 
For this study, we used a continuous reinforcement paradigm where music played 
only while walking met specified criteria; otherwise, music playback stopped. As 
a result, music was synchronized with walking performance. Seventeen 
participants walked on a nonmotorized treadmill at a self-selected pace. Across 
the session, different conditions arranged for music to play independent of 
walking speed or contingent on speed increases or decreases. An extinction 
component assessed performance when music was withdrawn completely. Walking 
speed was selectively increased and decreased by adjusting the contingencies 
that were arranged for music, and variability in speed increased during 
extinction, with both findings indicating that music was a reinforcer. Heart 
rate was also increased to moderate-vigorous intensities during reinforcement. 
The findings provide a compelling case that walking intensity can be modified by 
music reinforcement. We suggest that synchronous schedules may be an important 
foundation for future exercise technologies that are based on reinforcement.

Exoskeleton robots have the potential to augment human motor capabilities. 
however, current control strategies often require task-specific control laws 
tailored for different scenarios, which limits the applicability of 
exoskeletons. In this study, we propose a control strategy for exoskeleton 
robots that is adaptable across various scenarios. We employ adaptive 
oscillators (AO) with feedback control to rapidly estimate the wearer's motion 
phase and subsequently provide torque assistance to the wearer's hip joint based 
on a TCN-LSTM model. During experiments, we collected surface electromyographic 
(sEMG) signals from the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and rectus muscles of 
seven groups of subjects performing treadmill walking and inclined treadmill 
exercises. We utilized the short-time Fourier transform to extract frequency 
characteristics of the signals and statistically analyzed the rate of frequency 
change in each muscle group under different strategies. The results indicate 
that when wearing the exoskeleton, the overall muscle frequency changes more 
slowly, suggesting that subjects can maintain activity for a longer duration 
before fatigue sets in. This control strategy effectively reduces the energetic 
cost of lower limb work for the wearer and enhances the exoskeleton's 
versatility in various applications.

To fully understand brain processes in the real world, it is necessary to record 
and quantitatively analyse brain processes during real world human experiences. 
Mobile electroencephalography (EEG) and physiological data sensors provide new 
opportunities for studying humans outside of the laboratory. The purpose of this 
study was to document data from high-density EEG and mobile physiological 
sensors while humans performed a visual search task both on a treadmill in a 
laboratory setting and overground in a natural outdoor setting. The data set 
includes 49 young, healthy participants on an outdoor arboretum path and on a 
treadmill in a laboratory with a large virtual reality screen. The data provide 
a valuable research tool for scientists interested in signal processing, 
electrocortical brain processes, mobile brain imaging, and brain-computer 
interfaces based on mobile EEG. Given the comparison data between laboratory and 
real world conditions, researchers can test the viability of new processing 
algorithms across conditions or investigate changes in electrocortical activity 
related to behavioural dynamics coded into the data.

People with balance impairments often struggle performing turns or lateral 
maneuvers, which can increase risk of falls and injuries. Here we asked how 
people's mediolateral balance is impacted when walking on non-straight winding 
paths. Twenty-four healthy adults (12F / 12M; 25.8±3.5 yrs) participated. Each 
walked on each of six paths projected onto a treadmill, comprised of three 
pseudo-random path oscillation frequency combinations (straight, slowly-winding, 
quickly-winding), each presented at either wide or narrow width. We quantified 
stepping errors as the percent of steps taken off each path. We quantified 
minimum mediolateral Margin of Stability (MoSL) at each step and calculated 
means (μ) and standard deviations (σ) for each trial. We calculated lateral 
Probability of Instability (PoIL) as participants' statistical risk of taking 
unstable (MoSL < 0) steps. On narrower paths, participants made more stepping 
errors and walked with smaller μ(MoSL) for all path frequencies (p < 0.001), and 
exhibited increased PoIL on the straight and slowly-winding paths (p < 0.001). 
On winding paths, participants made progressively more stepping errors and 
walked with smaller μ(MoSL) as oscillation frequency increased on narrow paths 
(all p < 0.001) and on the wide quickly-winding paths (all p < 0.001). They also 
consistently walked with larger σ(MoSL), and increased PoILon higher sinuosity 
paths of both widths (all p < 0.001). Though many took numerous unstable steps, 
no participant fell. Our results demonstrate healthy adults' ability both to 
trade off increased risk of lateral instability for greater maneuverability, and 
to employ highly-versatile stepping strategies to maintain balance while 
walking.

The goal of this study was to determine the effects of applying random vs. 
constant constraint force to the non-paretic leg during walking on enhanced use 
of the paretic leg in individuals post-stroke, and examine the underlying brain 
mechanisms. Twelve individuals with chronic stroke were tested under two 
conditions while walking on a treadmill: random vs. constant magnitude of 
constraint force applied to the non-paretic leg during swing phase of gait using 
a custom designed robotic system. Leg kinematics, muscle activity of the paretic 
leg, and electroencephalography (EEG) were recorded during treadmill walking. 
Paretic step length and muscle activity of the paretic ankle plantarflexors 
significantly increased after walking with random and constant constraint 
forces. Cortico-cortical connectivity between motor cortices and 
cortico-muscular connectivity from the lesioned motor cortex to the paretic 
ankle plantarflexors significantly increased for the random force condition but 
not for the constant force condition. In addition, individuals post-stroke with 
greater baseline gait variability showed greater improvements in the paretic 
step length after walking with random force condition but not with the constant 
force condition. In conclusion, application of random constraint force to the 
non-paretic leg may enhance the use of the paretic leg during walking by 
facilitating cortical drive from the lesioned motor cortex to the paretic ankle 
plantarflexors. Results from this study may be used for the development of 
constraint induced locomotor intervention approaches aimed at improving 
locomotor function in individuals after stroke.

OBJECTIVES: Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is characterized by persistent 
neuromechanical impairments following an initial lateral ankle sprain. Ankle 
joint mobilization and plantar massage have improved the range of motion and 
static postural control in those with CAI. This study aimed to determine the 
impact of two-week joint mobilization and plantar massage interventions on gait 
kinematics and kinetics in individuals with CAI.
METHODS: A single-blind randomized trial was conducted with 60 participants with 
CAI, randomized into three groups: joint mobilization (n = 20), plantar massage 
(n = 20), and control (n = 20). The two treatment groups received six 5-min 
sessions manual therapy over a 2-week, while the control group received no 
intervention. Gait biomechanics were assessed on an instrumented treadmill 
before and after the intervention using 3D kinematics and kinetics analysis. 
Analyses compared biomechanical outcomes from each treatment group to the 
control group individually using a 1-dimensional statistical parametric mapping. 
The alpha level was set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Eighteen participants per group were part of the final analysis. No 
significant main or interactions effects were found for ankle sagittal or 
frontal plane positions following either intervention (p > 0.05 for all 
comparisons). COP location relative to the lateral border of the foot also did 
not change (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that two-week joint mobilization and plantar 
massage interventions do not significantly alter gait biomechanics in 
individuals with CAI. These results support the need for gait-specific 
interventions to modify biomechanics in this population.

The maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) has been used to quantify the dynamic 
stability of human locomotion. The method for estimating MLE requires selecting 
a proper time series of kinematic variables and reconstructing phase space using 
proper time delay. The data length also affects the reliability of the measured 
MLE. However, there has been no criterion for the choice of the time series, 
time delay or data length. Here, we quantified the effect of these factors on 
the test-retest reliability of MLE estimations. We recruited 15 young and 
healthy adults and let them walk on a treadmill three times. We calculated MLE 
employing various lengths of time series of 18 frequently used kinematic 
variables and two typical choices of time delay: fixed delay and delay selected 
by average mutual information algorithm. Then, we measured the intraclass 
correlation coefficient (ICC) of the measured MLE under each condition. Our 
results show that the choice of time delay does not affect reliability. Five 
among the 18 kinematic variables enabled excellent reliability with ICC above 
0.9 within 450 strides and also enabled ICC above 0.75 even with 60 or less 
strides. These findings can contribute to establishing the criteria for 
measuring the dynamic stability of human walking.

BACKGROUND: Citrulline malate (CM), especially when used in conjunction with 
physical exercise, has demonstrated potential as a non-pharmacological adjunct 
in the management of hypertension. Nevertheless, its impact on nocturnal blood 
pressure dipping remains unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the impact of a single dose of CM on nocturnal blood 
pressure dipping after exercise in hypertensive individuals.
METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial, 
twenty hypertensive adults (55 ± 16 years) were randomly assigned to either a CM 
(6 g) or placebo (6 g of corn starch) group (PLA). Resting blood pressure was 
measured after a 20-min period of comfortable seating in a calm environment. 
Both groups underwent 40 min of treadmill running/walking at an intensity of 
60-70% of their reserve heart rate, 120 min after ingesting the substances. 
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was employed to measure blood pressure over 
24 h.
RESULTS: No significant differences in systolic blood pressure values were 
observed between the CM and PLA groups at rest, during wakefulness, sleep, or 
over a 24-h period. However, CM exhibited a significant reduction in diastolic 
blood pressure in several metrics: delta 24 h (-14 mmHg vs -6 mmHg, p = 0.047), 
delta wakefulness (-12 mmHg vs -4 mmHg, p = 0.024), percent delta 24 h (-16% vs 
-6%, p = 0.024), and percent delta wakefulness (-14% vs -4%, p = 0.013). No 
significant differences were found between CM and PLA in terms of systolic and 
diastolic nocturnal absolute reductions (-13 mmHg vs -12 mmHg, p = 0.808, and 
-13 mmHg vs -8 mmHg, p = 0.273, respectively) or nocturnal percentage decrease 
(-9.9% vs -9.4%, p = 0.844, and -15.3% vs -11.7%, p = 0.399, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The study found no significant changes in the post-exercise 
nocturnal blood pressure dip following a single dose of CM supplementation. 
However, a notable reduction in diastolic blood pressure was observed during the 
waking period and over the average 24-h monitoring period.

Falls commonly occur during walking, particularly when struggling to respond to 
unexpected perturbations. Proprioception plays a significant role in detecting 
body destabilization even before reactions to perturbations are required. This 
study investigates the contribution of proprioceptive reweighting strategies to 
reactive balance during walking. This cross-sectional, proof-of-concept study 
included fifteen healthy adults (18-40 years). Ankle and back muscle vibrators 
disrupted proprioceptive input in stance, allowing calculation of the 
proprioceptive reweighting index. Walk-slip perturbations were then administered 
on an ActiveStep treadmill. A linear regression model assessed the significance 
of proprioceptive reweighting in predicting post-slip stability (margin of 
stability). Participants shifted from an ankle-steered to a central-steered 
proprioceptive strategy on a foam surface with closed eyes (Difference = 15.70 % 
(SD=37.87), 95 %CI [0.41, 30.99], p = 0.045). The regression model explained 
22.7 % of the variance in pre-touchdown margin of stability, with proprioceptive 
reweighting on foam significantly contributing to post-perturbation postural 
control (p < 0.001). Proprioceptive reweighting provides a moderate explanation 
for the mechanisms of reactive balance, highlighting that the key to effective 
balance recovery strategies may lie in the person's ability to both detect and 
respond to imbalances. Further research should explore if these proprioceptive 
strategies are a matter of directional control and if responses differ in older 
adults.

Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) exhibit less-selective, simplified muscle 
activation during gait due to injury of the developing brain. Abnormal motor 
unit recruitment, altered excitation-inhibition balance, and muscle 
morphological changes all affect the CP electromyogram. High-density surface 
electromyography (HDsEMG) has potential to reveal novel manifestations of CP 
neuromuscular pathology and functional deficits by assessing spatiotemporal 
details of myoelectric activity. We used HDsEMG to investigate spatial-EMG 
distribution and temporal-EMG complexity of gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle 
during treadmill walking in 11 adolescents with CP and 11 typically developed 
(TD) adolescents. Our results reveal more-uniform spatial-EMG amplitude 
distribution across the GM in adolescents with CP, compared to distal emphasis 
in TD adolescents. More-uniform spatial-EMG was associated with stronger ankle 
co-contraction and spasticity. CP adolescents exhibited a non-significant trend 
towards elevated EMG-temporal complexity. Homogenous spatial distribution and 
disordered temporal evolution of myoelectric activity in CP suggests 
less-structured and desynchronized recruitment of GM motor units, in combination 
with muscle morphological changes. Using HDsEMG, we uncovered novel evidence of 
atypical spatiotemporal activation during gait in CP, opening paths towards 
deeper understanding of motor control deficits and better characterization of 
changes in muscular activation from interventions.

Many people with chronic stroke (PwCS) exhibit deficits in step width 
modulation, an important strategy for walking balance. A single exposure to 
swing leg perturbations can temporarily strengthen this modulation. The 
objective of this parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was to 
investigate whether repeated perturbations cause sustained increases in step 
modulation (NCT02964039; funded by the VA). 54 PwCS at the Medical University of 
South Carolina were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: 
Control (n = 18), with minimal forces; Assistive (n = 18), pushing the swing leg 
toward a mechanically appropriate location; Perturbing (n = 18), pushing the 
swing leg away from a mechanically appropriate location. All intervention groups 
included 24 training sessions over 12-weeks with up to 30-minutes of treadmill 
walking while interfaced with a novel force-field and a 12-week follow-up 
period, with five interspersed assessment sessions. Our primary outcome measure 
was paretic step width modulation, the partial correlation between step width 
and pelvis displacement (ρSW). Secondarily, we quantified swing and stance leg 
contributions to step modulation, clinical assessments of walking balance and 
confidence, and real-world falls. Outcomes were analyzed for participants who 
completed all assessment sessions (n = 44). Only the Perturbing group exhibited 
significant increases in paretic ρSW, which were present after 4-weeks of 
training and sustained through follow-up (t = 2.42-3.17). These changes were due 
to improved control of paretic swing leg positioning. However, 
perturbation-induced changes in step modulation were not always significantly 
greater than those in the Control group, and clinical assessments were similar 
across intervention groups. Participants in the Perturbing group experienced a 
lower fall rate than those in the Control group (incidence rate ratio = 0.53), 
although our small sample size warrants caution. The present results indicate 
that perturbations can cause sustained modifications of targeted biomechanical 
characteristics of post-stroke gait, although such changes alone may be 
insufficient to change more complex clinical assessments.

BACKGROUND: The ever-increasing sport level makes every single detail of the 
athlete's cardiorespiratory profile count, and therefore, it is deemed crucial 
to clarify how the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) 
affects the energy economy of an athlete compared to the ACL-deficient and 
healthy subjects. The purpose of this review was to systematically analyze the 
studies investigating the correlation between the energy-oxygen cost in patients 
following ACLR in unreconstructed and intact ACLs.
METHODS: We conducted this systematic review according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. 
PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases were searched, and eight articles 
describing miscellaneous methods for the assessment of oxygen consumption in 
patients with ACL deficiency or ACL reconstructed knees were included.
RESULTS: In total, 285 subjects were recorded with a mean age of 29.61 years. 
The type of exercise the patients were subjected to varied among the studies, 
including one-leg cycling, exercise in the closed kinetic chain, walking, 
jogging, or running at various speeds, and treadmill inclinations. The energy 
expenditure of an ACL-deficient patient is considerably higher than a healthy 
subject. Additionally, chronicity of the ACL tear is not correlated with energy 
expenditure. ACL deficiency leads to higher energy consumption, not only during 
walking but during jogging as well. ACLR could improve the efficiency of walking 
by lowering the energy demands. After ACLR, professional soccer players' aerobic 
capacity (VO2max) is improved significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: ACL insufficiency affects substantially the metabolic energy costs, 
resulting in increased energy expenditure. According to current literature, ACLR 
can help to partially reverse this condition, as significant improvements and a 
more efficient, energy-wise, locomotion are expected. However, further research 
is necessary to clarify if ACLR can completely normalize energy expenditure 
again. HIPPOKRATIA 2023, 27 (4):119-125.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the influence of older vs. younger age and 
previous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury on resting serum cartilage 
oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP(tpre)) concentration, on immediate load-induced 
sCOMP kinetics after a 30-min treadmill walking stress (∆_sCOMP(tpost)), and on 
the dose-response relationship between ambulatory load magnitude and 
∆_sCOMP(tpost).
METHODS: A total of 85 participants were recruited in 4 groups (20-30 years: 24 
healthy, 23 ACL-injured; 40-60 years: 23 healthy, 15 ACL-injured). Blood samples 
were collected immediately before and after a walking stress at 80%, 100%, or 
120% bodyweight (BW) on 3 test days and analyzed for sCOMP concentration. Linear 
models were used to estimate the effect of age, knee status (unilateral ACL 
injury, 2-10 years prior), and sex on sCOMP(tpre), ∆_sCOMP(tpost), and the 
dose-response between ambulatory load magnitude and ∆_sCOMP(tpost).
RESULTS: We found that sCOMP(tpre) was 21% higher in older than younger 
participants (p < 0.001) but did not differ between ACL-injured and healthy 
participants (p = 0.632). Also, ∆_sCOMP(tpost) was 19% lower in older than 
younger participants (p = 0.030) and increased with body mass index (p < 0.001), 
sCOMP(tpre) (p = 0.008), and with 120%BW (p < 0.001), independent of age, ACL 
injury, or sex.
CONCLUSION: Age but not prior ACL injury influences resting sCOMP and 
load-induced sCOMP. The dose-response relationship between ambulatory load 
magnitude and load-induced sCOMP changes is not affected by age, ACL injury, or 
sex. A better understanding of systemic sCOMP and the role of its 
mechanoresponse for the understanding of osteoarthritis pathophysiology and 
monitoring intervention efficacy may require knowledge of individual cartilage 
composition and tissue-level loading parameters.

BACKGROUND: Gait retraining, which typically focuses on the most severely 
affected limb or joint, has shown promising results in treating faulty running 
and walking patterns. The closed-chain nature of gait during the stance phase 
may influence kinematic changes in the adjacent joints of the trained leg. In 
addition, the coupled nature of the lower extremity motion of gait suggests that 
changes in one leg may transfer to the other. This study aimed to assess the 
intra- and inter-limb transfer of kinematic changes following gait retraining to 
reduce knee extension in individuals with hyperextension walking patterns.
METHODS: Seventeen women with knee hyperextension gait patterns participated in 
six treadmill retraining sessions. All participants received verbal and 
real-time visual kinematic feedback in the form of knowledge of results. This 
intervention study took place at the Gait Analysis Laboratory at the University 
of Iowa. Mean peak sagittal-plane lower extremity joint kinematics during 
overground walking at pretraining, post-training, and 1- and 8-month follow-ups 
were calculated for analysis and comparisons.
FINDINGS: The post-training changes in ankle range of motion returned to 
baseline values by the 8-month follow-up. There was a significant transfer 
effect of kinematic changes to the untrained knee following gait retraining.
INTERPRETATION: Training one knee did not result in long-term compensatory 
kinematic changes in the other joints. In addition, the improvements in knee 
extension range of motion were transferred to the untrained knee and retained at 
the 8-month follow-up. This study supports the use of gait retraining as an 
effective clinical intervention.

BACKGROUND: Vestibulospinal reflexes play a role in maintaining the upright 
posture of the trunk. Head orientation has been shown to modify the 
vestibulospinal reflexes during standing. This study investigated how vestibular 
signals affect paraspinal muscle activity during walking, and whether head 
orientation changes these effects.
METHODS: Sixteen participants were instructed to walk on a treadmill for 8 min 
at 78 steps/min and 2.8 km/h in four conditions defined by the presence of 
electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) and by head orientation (facing forward 
and facing leftward), while bipolar electromyography (EMG) was recorded 
bilaterally from the paraspinal muscles from cervical to lumbar levels.
RESULTS: In both head orientations, significant phasic EVS-EMG coherence in the 
paraspinal muscles was observed at ipsilateral and/or contralateral heel 
strikes. Compared to walking with the head forward, a significant decrease was 
found in EVS-evoked responses (i.e., EVS-EMG coherence and gain) when 
participants walked with the leftward head orientation, with which EVS induced 
disturbance in the sagittal plane. This overall decrease can be explained by 
less need of feedback control for walking stabilization in the sagittal plane 
compared to in the frontal plane. The decrease in coherence was only significant 
at the left lower vertebral levels and at the right upper vertebral levels 
around left heel strikes.
CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the contribution of the vestibular afferent 
signals to the control of paraspinal muscle activity during walking and indicate 
that this control is changed in response to different head orientations.

Rhythmic auditory cueing (RAC) using an isochronous metronome is an effective 
approach to immediately enhance spatiotemporal aspects of gait for people with 
Parkinson disease (PwPD). Whereas entraining to RAC typically occurs 
subconsciously via cerebellar pathways, the use of metronome frequencies that 
deviate from one's typical cadence, such as those used in rehabilitation, may 
require conscious awareness. This heightened awareness may increase cognitive 
load and limit the persistence of gait training gains. Here, we explore the 
immediate effects of incorporating an implicit motor learning approach (i.e., 
error-based recalibration) to gait training with RAC. Twenty older adults (10 
with PD and 10 controls) were asked to match their footfalls to both isochronous 
and subtly varying metronomes while walking on a treadmill and overground. Our 
findings revealed intriguing differences between treadmill and overground 
walking. During treadmill walking to a slower metronome frequency, both groups 
reduced their cadence and increased step lengths, but did not make the necessary 
adjustments to match the subtly varying metronome. During overground walking, 
both groups modified their cadence in response to a 3-4% change in metronome 
frequency (p < 0.05). Both metronomes yielded evidence of implicit and explicit 
retention during overground and treadmill walking. Furthermore, during 
overground walking the PD group showed greater implicit retention of cadence 
changes following the varying metronome, compared to the isochronous metronome. 
Our results suggest that incorporating implicit motor learning approaches to 
gait training during a single session of overground walking may enhance short 
term implicit retention of gait behaviors for PwPD.

BACKGROUND: To study the effects of different interventions on automatic gait 
processing in contrast with voluntary gait processing in healthy subjects.
METHODS: A double-blind randomised controlled trial was designed (120 able-body 
persons between 18 and 65 years old entered and completed the study), with 
pre-intervention and post-intervention assessments using the 6-Minute Walk Test 
(6MWT). The participants were randomly distributed into four groups. Prior to 
intervention, all participants performed voluntary gait on the ground (VoG) in a 
calibrated circuit following the 6MWT. The presence of automatic gait (AG) was 
explored post-intervention without a voluntary demand in the same circuit 
following the 6MWT. Each group received a different intervention for 30 min: 
Vojta stimulation, MOTOMED® at no less than 60 revolutions/minute, treadmill 
walking at 3 km/h, and resting in a chair (control). The main assessment, 
conducted by a blinded rater, was the difference in distance covered (in meters) 
during the 6MWT between pre- and post-intervention. Surface electromyography 
(sEMG) average root mean square (RMS) signals in the right tibialis anterior, 
right soleus, right rectus femoris, and right biceps femoris were also 
considered outcome measures.
RESULTS: The Vojta group was the only one that initiated AG after the 
intervention (476.4 m ± 57.1 in VoG versus 9.0 m ± 8.9 in AG, p < 0.001) with 
comparable kinematics and EMG parameters during voluntary gait, except for ankle 
dorsal flexion. Within the Vojta group, high variability in kinematics, sEMG 
activity, and distance covered was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: AG isolation is approachable through Vojta at only one session 
measurable with the 6MWT without any voluntary gait demand. No automatic gait 
effects were observed post-intervention in the other groups.

This study asked if combining different motor learning mechanisms-adaptation and 
reinforcement-could produce immediate improvements in over ground walking after 
stroke. Fifteen adults with stroke engaged in three conditions: (1) 
reinforcement following adaptation, (2) reinforcement alone, and (3) adaptation 
alone. Adaptation involved split-belt treadmill walking to produce after-effects 
that reduce step asymmetry. Reinforcement involved the use of real-time auditory 
feedback about step length asymmetry. Auditory feedback was binary, signaling 
whether steps were asymmetric or equal, but not whether to shorten or lengthen 
either step. Change in step length asymmetry was the outcome assessed during 
over ground walking. Reinforcement following adaptation led to reductions in 
step length asymmetry that persisted into an immediate retention period. 
Importantly, it led to the desired pattern of lengthening the shorter step in a 
majority of participants. Reinforcement alone led to no significant change in 
step length asymmetry, and sometimes produced a non-optimal pattern of 
shortening the longer step. Our control condition of adaptation alone led to 
more transient reductions in step length asymmetry. These findings reveal the 
potential for utilizing serial delivery of adaptation and reinforcement to 
influence a complex movement in the real-world context of over ground walking, 
in people with stroke.

Neuronal development is a highly regulated process that is dependent on the 
correct coordination of cellular responses to extracellular cues. In response to 
semaphorin axon guidance proteins, the MICAL1 protein is stimulated to produce 
reactive oxygen species that oxidize actin on specific methionine residues, 
leading to filamentous actin depolymerization and consequent changes in neuronal 
growth cone dynamics. Crossing genetically modified mice homozygous for floxed 
Mical1 (Mical1fl/fl) alleles with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase 
under the control of a tyrosinase gene enhancer/promoter (Tyr::Cre) enabled 
conditional Mical1 deletion. Immunohistochemical analysis showed Mical1 
expression in the cerebellum, which plays a prominent role in the coordination 
of motor movements, with reduced Mical1 expression in Mical1fl/fl mice 
co-expressing Tyr::Cre. Analysis of the gaits of mice running on a treadmill 
showed that both male and female Mical1fl/fl, Tyr::Cre mutant mice had 
significant alterations to their striding patterns relative to wild-type mice, 
although the specific aspects of their altered gaits differed between the sexes. 
Additional motor tests that involved movement on a rotating rod, descending a 
vertical pole, or crossing a balance beam did not show significant differences 
between the genotypes, suggesting that the effect of the Mical1fl/fl, Tyr::Cre 
genetic modifications was only manifested during specific highly coordinated 
movements that contribute to running. These findings indicate that there is a 
behavioral consequence in Mical1fl/fl, Tyr::Cre mutant mice that affects motor 
control as manifested by alterations in their gait.

Understanding the complex three-dimensional (3D) dynamic interactions between 
self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and the human torso is critical to 
assessing potential impacts on firefighter health and informing equipment 
design. This study employed a multi-inertial sensor fusion technology to 
quantify these interactions. Six volunteer firefighters performed walking and 
running experiments on a treadmill while wearing the SCBA. Calculations of 
interaction forces and moments from the multi-inertial sensor technology were 
validated against a 3D motion capture system. The predicted interaction forces 
and moments showed good agreement with the measured data, especially for the 
forces (normal and lateral) and moments (x- and z-direction components) with 
relative root mean square errors (RMSEs) below 9.4%, 7.7%, 7.7%, and 7.8%, 
respectively. Peak pack force reached up to 150 N, significantly exceeding the 
SCBA's intrinsic weight during SCBA carriage. The proposed multi-inertial sensor 
fusion technique can effectively evaluate the 3D dynamic interactions and 
provide a scientific basis for health monitoring and ergonomic optimization of 
SCBA systems for firefighters.

BACKGROUND: The majority of research primarily examines the role of the 
vestibular system in regulating balance by assessing gait parameters in the 
transverse plane while neglecting those in the sagittal plane. The present study 
aimed to examine the impact of various forms of mastoid vibration (MV) on 
minimum toe clearance (MTC) and its pattern of variability. This study proposed 
two hypotheses: 1) the application of MV reduced the MTC, and 2) the application 
of different forms of MV influenced the amount and structure of MTC variability.
METHODS: A total of twenty young adults participated in this study. A 
high-resolution motion capture system with eight cameras captured the minimum 
toe clearance. Three locomotor tasks were randomly assigned to these young 
participants: 1) walking normally on the treadmill, 2) walking with unilateral 
MV, and 3) walking with bilateral MV. The dependent variables were the mean of 
MTC, the amount, and the structure of MTC variability. The amount of MTC 
variability was calculated by the coefficient of variation represented, and the 
structure of MTC variability was measured using a sample entropy measure for a 
total of 200 MTCs.
RESULTS: Applying unilateral and bilateral MV decreased the MTC significantly 
(-1.6 %, p = 0.038; -4.3 %, p < 0.001) compared to normal walking. Also, 
applying unilateral MV increased the amount (11.8 %, p = 0.001) and structure of 
MTC variability (14.3 %, p < 0.001) compared to normal walking. However, 
applying bilateral MV decreased the amount (-8.8 %, p = 0.001) and structure of 
MTC variability (-9.0 %, p < 0.001) compared to regular walking.
CONCLUSION: Although the statistical differences in MTC and MTC variability were 
observed in the present study, the mean differences among the different MV 
conditions were relatively small, thereby requiring meticulous deliberation when 
extrapolating the results when implementing this MTC in the pathological cohort.

BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional motion analysis using optoelectronic cameras and 
force platforms is typically used to quantify gait disorders. However, these 
systems have various limitations, particularly when assessing patients in an 
ecological environment. To address these limitations, several wearable devices 
have been developed. However, few studies have reported metrological information 
regarding their repeatability and sensitivity to change.
METHODS: A healthy adult performed 6 min walking tests with FeetMe® system 
insoles under different walking conditions overground and on a treadmill. The 
standard error of measurement (SEM), the minimum detectable differences (MDDs), 
and the effect size (ES) were calculated for spatio-temporal parameters, and the 
ground reaction force was calculated from the 16,000 steps recorded.
RESULTS: SEM values were below 3.9% for the ground reaction force and below 6.8% 
for spatio-temporal parameters. ES values were predominantly high, with 72.9% of 
cases between overground and treadmill conditions with induced asymmetry, and 
64.5% of cases between treadmill conditions with and without induced asymmetry 
exhibiting an ES greater than 1.2. The minimum detectable differences ranged 
from 4.5% to 10.7% for ground reaction forces and 2.1% to 18.9% for 
spatio-temporal parameters.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the FeetMe® system is a reliable 
solution. The sensitivity to change showed that these instrumented insoles can 
effectively reflect patient asymmetry and progress.

BACKGROUND: The quantification of electromyographic activity using surface 
electrodes is invaluable for understanding gait disorders in patients with 
central nervous system lesions. We propose to evaluate a commercially available 
low-cost system compared to a reference system in participants with 
stroke-related movement disorders in functional situations.
METHODS: Three hemiparetic participants performed three functional tasks: two 
treadmill walks at different speeds and a sit-to-stand test. The vastus 
lateralis and gastrocnemius medialis muscles were equipped with two EMG sensors. 
The comparison between the two EMG systems was based on 883 identified cycles. 
Spearman's correlation coefficients (SCs), linear correlation coefficients 
(LCCs), and cross-correlation coefficients (CCCs) were calculated.
RESULTS: The main results indicate good to very good similarity of the EMG 
signals collected from the two tested sEMG systems. In the comfortable-walking 
condition, an SC of 0.894 ± 0.091 and an LCC of 0.909 ± 0.094 were noted. In the 
fast-walking condition, an SC of 0.918 ± 0.064 and an LCC of 0.935 ± 0.056 were 
observed. For the 1 min sit-to-stand test, an SC of 0.880 ± 0.058 and an LCC of 
0.881 ± 0.065 were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates good to very good similarity between the 
two sEMG systems, enabling the analysis of muscle activity during functional 
tasks.

BACKGROUND: Limited research exists for use of transcutaneous spinal stimulation 
(TSS) in pediatric spinal cord injuries (SCI) to improve walking outcomes, 
especially in children diagnosed with SCI secondary to acute flaccid myelitis 
(AFM).
OBJECTIVE: This case series demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of TSS 
paired with gait training in children diagnosed with AFM.
METHODS: A total of 4 participants diagnosed with incomplete SCI secondary to 
AFM completed 22, 2-h therapy sessions over 5-8 weeks. TSS paired with body 
weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) was provided for the first 30 min of 
each session. Changes in walking function were assessed through the 6 min walk 
test (6MWT), Timed Up and Go (TUG), 10 m walk test (10MWT), and walking index 
for spinal cord injury II (WISCI-II). To assess safety and feasibility, pain, 
adverse events, and participant and therapist exertion were monitored.
RESULTS: All participants tolerated the TSS intervention without pain or an 
adverse response. Changes in the 6MWT exceeded the minimal clinically important 
difference (MCID) for three participants and WISCI-II exceeding the minimal 
detectable change (MDC) for two of the participants.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that TSS is a safe and clinically 
feasible intervention for pediatric patients with AFM and may supplement 
gait-based interventions to facilitate improvements in walking function.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Rett syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that 
can severely affect motor functioning, particularly walking. Previous training 
programs proposed treadmills as tools to increase walking endurance of patients 
with Rett syndrome, but these trainings did not include virtual reality (VR). 
The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a short treadmill 
training coupled to VR in girls with Rett syndrome.
METHODS: Nine patients with Rett syndrome underwent a 3-day treadmill walking 
program performed in semi-immersive VR. During the training, the happiness index 
and performance metrics were collected. At the end of the training parents 
filled out the Suitability Evaluation Questionnaire (SEQ) and, when feasible, 
patients underwent a gait assessment.
RESULTS: All the subjects recruited performed the three GRAIL sessions and 
parents showed a good satisfaction and considered the integration of treadmill 
and VR a good possibility for future rehabilitative programs. Participants 
showed greater satisfaction in environments requiring walking and their 
attention increased during training sessions, hypothesizing the feasibility of 
longer trainings with treadmill and VR. Data collected from gait analysis 
provided insights, although preliminary, concerning differences in gait pattern 
amongst the recruited subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small sample size and limited training duration, the 
paper suggests that a walking training with a treadmill combined with VR can 
represent a new strategy for Rett rehabilitation.

Step Width Estimation in Individuals With and Without Neurodegenerative Disease 
via a Novel Data-Augmentation Deep Learning Model and Minimal Wearable Inertial 
Sensors.

Wang H, Ullah Z, Gazit E, Brozgol M, Tan T, Hausdorff JM, Shull PB, Ponger P.

Step width is vital for gait stability, postural balance control, and fall risk 
reduction. However, estimating step width typically requires either fixed 
cameras or a full kinematic body suit of wearable inertial measurement units 
(IMUs), both of which are often too expensive and time-consuming for clinical 
application. We thus propose a novel data-augmented deep learning model for 
estimating step width in individuals with and without neurodegenerative disease 
using a minimal set of wearable IMUs. Twelve patients with neurodegenerative, 
clinically diagnosed Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) performed over ground 
walking trials, and seventeen healthy individuals performed treadmill walking 
trials at various speeds and gait modifications while wearing IMUs on each shank 
and the pelvis. Results demonstrated step width mean absolute errors of 3.3 0.7 
cm and 2.9 0.5 cm for the neurodegenerative and healthy groups, respectively, 
which were below the minimal clinically important difference of 6.0 cm. Step 
width variability mean absolute errors were 1.5 cm and 0.8 cm for 
neurodegenerative and healthy groups, respectively. Data augmentation 
significantly improved accuracy performance in the neurodegenerative group, 
likely because they exhibited larger variations in walking kinematics as 
compared with healthy subjects. These results could enable clinically meaningful 
and accurate portable step width monitoring for individuals with and without 
neurodegenerative disease, potentially enhancing rehabilitative training, 
assessment, and dynamic balance control in clinical and real-life settings.

Soft exosuits have emerged as potent assistive tools for walking support and 
rehabilitation training. However, most existing soft exosuit systems rely on 
preset assistance modes, which may not accurately align with individual 
physiological states and movement requirements, leading to variable user 
experiences and efficacy. While existing human-in-the-loop (HIL) research 
predominantly focuses on optimizing metabolic cost and torque difference 
parameters, there is a notable absence of real-time monitoring methods that 
closely reflect the human body's physiological state and strategies that 
dynamically indicate walking efficiency. Motivated by this, we developed a novel 
personalized power-assist system. This system optimizes the power-assist output 
of the hip joint by monitoring the user's physiological and motion signals in 
real time, including heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), and 
inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, to assist hip flexion based on feedback. 
The findings from a metabolic expenditure trial demonstrate that the innovative 
soft exosuit, which is based on a Physiological State Monitoring Control (PSMC) 
system, achieves a reduction of 7.81% in metabolic expenditure during treadmill 
walking at a speed of 3.5 km/h compared to walking without the assistance of the 
exosuit. Additionally, during continuous exercise with varying intensities, the 
metabolic consumption level is reduced by 5.1%, 5.8%, and 8.2% at speeds of 2, 
4, and 6 km per hour, respectively. These results support the design of a novel 
hip flexion-assisting soft exosuit, demonstrating that applying different 
assistance forces in consideration of different physiological states is a 
reasonable approach to reducing metabolic consumption.

BACKGROUND: Patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) who receive unilateral total 
knee arthroplasty (TKA) often report reduced pain and enhanced function in the 
untreated knee, yet the kinematic mechanisms are not fully understood. Our study 
aimed to clarify these effects through a gait analysis of the untreated knee 
following unilateral TKA.
METHODS: This study enrolled 118 end-stage OA patients with varus deformity 
scheduled for TKA, categorized into the contralateral osteoarthritis group 
(Contra-OA), consisting of patients with end-stage OA in both knees requiring 
surgical treatment, and the contralateral TKA group (Contra-TKA), which included 
patients who had undergone TKA on one knee and had end-stage OA in the untreated 
knee awaiting surgery. Kinematic data of the knee joint during treadmill walking 
were collected using the Opti_Knee gait analysis system, and a comparative 
analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: The Contra-TKA group exhibited improvements in step length, 
anterior-posterior translation, range of motion, vertical translation, and 
internal-external rotation compared to the Contra-OA group (p-values ranging 
from 0.0013 to 0.0463). Notable differences in flexion-extension angles and 
abduction/adduction rotation were also observed (p = 0.0013 and 0.0166, 
respectively). At the initial contact (IC), obvious differences in 
internal-external rotation, anterior/posterior translation, and vertical 
translation were noted. At the opposite toe-off (OT), significant differences in 
internal-external rotation. At the tibia vertical (TV) moment, significant 
differences were observed in all three translation indicators of joint 
translation. At other pivotal gait cycle points, vertical and anterior/posterior 
translations in Contra-TKA group continued to exhibit more meaningful decrease. 
Collectively, these findings underscore the protective kinematic effects of TKA 
on the untreated contralateral knee, indicating an improved biomechanical 
adaptation following TKA surgery.
CONCLUSION: In summary, the study's findings indicate that unilateral TKA 
imparts kinetic effects on the untreated contralateral knee, as evidenced by 
significant improvements in key gait parameters. These enhancements, observed at 
both initial contacts and throughout the gait cycle, suggest a positive 
biomechanical support post-TKA, might contribute to better gait efficiency and 
reduced load on the contralateral untreated knee.

BACKGROUND: The one of the most commonly used reference system for clinical gait 
analysis is an optical motion capture system (OMC) using a multi-segment foot 
model. A time- and cost-efficient alternative could be an inertial measurement 
unit (IMU)-based systems. However, these are limited to a single segment 
approach for the foot and ankle. Therefore, the current setup was modified to be 
based on a 2-segment foot model, allowing for a separate analysis of the hind- 
and midfoot. The study aimed to evaluate the reliability (inter-rater, 
intra-rater, and test-retest reliability) of an IMU-based 2-segment foot model.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects were recruited to test the 
inter-rater, intra-rater, and test-retest reliability of the new IMU based 
2-segment foot model. Gait analysis was performed on a treadmill at a constant 
speed of 4 km/h. Kinematic data of the tibia/hindfoot, tibia/forefoot and 
hindfoot/forefoot over 100 % gait cycle were analyzed. The reliability was 
tested by using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and the intraclass 
correlation coefficient (ICC).
RESULTS: The SPM showed no significant difference for inter-, intra-rater, and 
test-retest reliability, but for a small segment of tibia/forefoot dorsiflexion 
test-retest reliability (2.1° difference). The single standard deviation 
measurement error for the sagittal and transverse plane was <5° and worse for 
the frontal plane.
CONCLUSION: The new 2-segment foot model revealed a high inter-rater, 
intra-rater, and test-retest reliability. It is suitable for use in adult 
clinical practice. Still, comparative data to the OMC system using a 
multi-segment foot model are missing.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Walking and balance impairments after stroke are a 
global health concern, causing significant morbidity and mortality. However, 
effective strategies for achieving meaningful recovery in the chronic stages are 
limited. Backward locomotor treadmill training (BLTT) is a novel walking 
rehabilitation protocol that is safe, feasible, and likely beneficial in stroke 
survivors; however, its efficacy has not been tested. This single-center, 
randomized, assessor-blind clinical trial aims to test the preliminary efficacy 
of BLTT compared to forward locomotor treadmill training (FLTT) on walking 
speed, symmetry, and postural stability.
METHODS: Forty stroke survivors [BLTT (N=19), FLTT (N=21); mean age= 56.3 ± 8.6 
years; 53% Female; 30% Non-Hispanic Black] with mild-moderate walking impairment 
were enrolled. Participants underwent nine 30-minute BLTT or FLTT sessions over 
three weeks. The primary outcome was the mean change in the 10-meter walk test 
(10 MWT) at 24 hours post-training (24 hr POST). Secondary outcome measures were 
changes in spatiotemporal walking symmetry and postural stability during quiet 
standing at 24 hr POST. Retention was explored at Days 30- and 90 POST.
RESULTS: We report clinically meaningful (≥ 0.16 m/s) improvements in overground 
walking speed at 24 hr POST, with retention up to Day 90 POST with BLTT and 
FLTT. However, contrary to our working hypothesis, no between-group differences 
in walking speed were observed. Nonetheless, we found that BLTT resulted in 
offline improvements in spatial symmetry and retention of subcomponents of the 
modified clinical test of sensory interaction on balance (mCTSIB), including the 
testing of proprio-vestibular integration up to Day 30 POST.
CONCLUSION: Among chronic stroke patients with mild-moderate walking impairment, 
BLTT and FLTT both resulted in long-lasting and clinically meaningful 
improvement in walking speed. However, preliminary findings suggest that BLTT 
may better comprehensively target walking asymmetry and sensory systems 
processing and integration.

BACKGROUND: Whether structured exercise therapy improves chemotherapy delivery, 
tolerability, and tumor response is unclear.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a phase 2 trial investigating exercise 
therapy (n = 72) versus usual care (n = 72) in patients with primary breast 
cancer. Exercise therapy comprised individualized treadmill walking three times 
weekly for 20-50 minutes per session at 55%-100% of pretreatment exercise 
capacity. Chemotherapy delivery was assessed according to the relative dose 
intensity (RDI), tolerability was assessed according to patient-reported 
outcomes and blood laboratory values, and response was assessed based on the 
pathologic complete response rate in patients who received neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy.
RESULTS: In the exercise therapy group, 51 patients (71%) reached 100% RDI 
(median, 100%; interquartile range, 100%-100%) compared with 41 patients (57%) 
in the usual care group (median, 100%; interquartile range, 95%-100%; p = .08). 
Tolerability was similar in both groups; the rates of grade 3 or higher 
neutropenia and anemia were 22% versus 39% and 7% versus 10% in the exercise and 
usual care groups, respectively. In patients who received anthracyclines 
(n = 104), 41 (77%) had 100% chemotherapy RDI in the exercise therapy group 
versus 29 (57%) in the usual care group (p = .026). In the neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy subgroup (n = 51 tumors), the postneoadjuvant therapy (yp) 
pathologic complete response (ypT0ypN0) rate was 27% (95% confidence interval, 
12%-50%) in the exercise therapy group compared with 28% (95% confidence 
interval, 13%-47%) in the usual care group (p > .9).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with primary breast cancer, exercise therapy was 
associated with improved delivery of anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Although 
exercise therapy was not significantly associated with tumor response, effects 
varied by tumor subtype (trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier 
NCT01943695).

Stretch hyperreflexia is often a target for treatment to improve gait in 
children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). However, the presence of stretch 
hyperreflexia during gait remains debated. Therefore, we assessed the relation 
between gastrocnemius medialis muscle-tendon stretch and muscle activation 
during gait in children with CP compared to typically developing (TD) children. 
3D gait analysis including electromyography (EMG) and dynamic ultrasound was 
carried out to assess, respectively gastrocnemius medialis activation and 
fascicle, belly, and tendon stretch during treadmill walking. Musculotendon-unit 
stretch was also estimated using OpenSim. Ratios of EMG/peak lengthening 
velocities and accelerations were compared between CP and TD. Velocity and 
acceleration peaks prior to EMG peaks were qualitatively assessed. EMG/velocity 
and EMG/acceleration ratios were up to 500% higher for CP (n = 14) than TD 
(n = 15) for most structures. Increased late swing muscle activation in CP was 
often preceded by fascicle and musculotendon-unit peak lengthening velocity, and 
early stance muscle activation by peaks in multiple structures. Increased muscle 
activation in CP is associated with muscle-tendon stretch during gait. 
Concluding, late swing muscle activation in CP appears velocity-dependent, 
whereas early stance activation can be velocity- and acceleration-dependent. 
These insights into stretch reflex mechanisms during gait can assist development 
of targeted interventions.

A symmetric gait pattern in humans reflects near-identical movement in bilateral 
limbs during walking. However, little is known about how gait symmetry changes 
on different inclines. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap using the 
central pattern generator and internal model hypotheses. Eighteen healthy young 
adults underwent five 2-minute walking trials (inclines of +15%, +8%, 0%, -8%, 
and -15%). Dependent variables included step time, step length, step width, 
maximum heel clearance, time to peaks of maximum heel clearance, their 
corresponding coefficients of variation (CV), and respective symmetry indices 
(SI). Significant differences were observed in SI of step length (p = .022), 
step length variability (p < .001), step width variability (p =.001), maximum 
heel clearance (p < .001), and maximum heel clearance variability (p = .049). 
Compared to level walking, walking at -8% and -15% inclines increased SI of step 
length (p = .011, p = .039 respectively) but decreased SI of maximum heel 
clearance (p = .025, p = .019 respectively). These observations suggested that 
incline walking affected gait symmetry differently, possibly due to varied 
internal models used in locomotion. Downhill walking improved vertical gait 
symmetry but reduced anterior-posterior symmetry compared to level walking. 
Downhill walking may be a preferable rehabilitation protocol for enhancing gait 
symmetry, as it activates internal model controls. Even slight downhill inclines 
could increase active control loading, beneficial for the elderly and those with 
impaired gait.

Predictive equations are widely employed for estimating the volume of oxygen 
consumption (VO2) while walking, which is ultimately employed to determine 
energy expenditure and tailor exercise prescription. This study aimed to test 
the agreement between the measured VO2 and estimated VO2 during a walking 
protocol on a treadmill at 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 km/h. Thirty-eight young 
adults (50% women) participated in this cross-sectional study. The Omnical 
(Maastricht Instruments, Maastricht, The Netherlands) and K5 (Cosmed, Rome, 
Italy) metabolic systems were used to measure VO2. To determine the predictive 
equations, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE 
database from May 2022 to July 2023. Seven predictive equations were found and 
included for estimating VO2 values. We calculated the mean bias (mean difference 
between measured VO2 and estimated VO2) obtained at each speed using one-sample 
t-tests. We compared the VO2 measured and estimated values using repeated 
measures analysis of variance and the Bland-Altman method. One-sample t-tests 
showed that all score errors were different from zero (ranging from 1.1 to 
5.4 mL/kg/min). Thus, no predictive equation estimated similar VO2 values in 
comparison with the Omnical and K5 metabolic systems at all intensities. 
However, the Weyand equation showed the lowest bias across all intensities 
(score error of 1.1 mL/kg/min). This study showed a lack of agreement between 
the Omnical and K5 systems compared to diverse predictive equations specially 
designed to estimate VO2 during walking. Nevertheless, based on our results, the 
Weyand equation should be the preferred option.

OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder in humans and 
dogs. Due to its chronic progressive nature, the predominant clinical signs 
after a certain point are pain and immobility. The similar pathogenesis allows 
conclusions to be drawn from canine to human OA. Current treatments are limited 
and often attempt to treat OA symptoms rather than improve joint structure and 
function. Collagen hydrolysates as oral supplements are a promising therapeutic 
option to achieve this advanced therapeutic aim in both species. The effects of 
oral supplementation were therefore investigated in canine OA patients.
METHOD: In a systematic, placebo-controlled, double-blind interventional study 
in 31 dogs with naturally occurring OA, the efficacy of oral supplementation of 
specific bioactive collagen peptides (BCP) was tested in comparison to the 
approved combination of the active substances omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E. 
The dogs were examined on a horizontal treadmill with 4 integrated piezoelectric 
force plates at the beginning and end of a twelve-week test period. At both 
points, the owners completed a specific questionnaire containing the validated 
Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI) and the dogs were fitted with accelerometers 
to record total daily activity data.
RESULTS: Only the oral supplementation of BCP resulted in a significant 
improvement of several kinetic parameters measured using a force-plate fitted 
treadmill, and the quality of life assessed by CBPI, while accelerometry was 
unaffected by the intervention.
CONCLUSION: The results of this three-month BCP supplementation study using 
objective measurement parameters in dogs with naturally occurring OA demonstrate 
an efficacy, suggesting the therapeutic use of BCP in canine OA patients and 
demonstrating the relevance of this collagen hydrolysate formulation for the 
treatment of OA in human patients as well.

INTRODUCTION: Wearable exoskeletons assist individuals with mobility 
impairments, enhancing their gait and quality of life. This study presents the 
iP3T model, designed to optimize gait phase prediction through the fusion of 
multimodal time-series data.
METHODS: The iP3T model integrates data from stretch sensors, inertial 
measurement units (IMUs), and surface electromyography (sEMG) to capture 
comprehensive biomechanical and neuromuscular signals. The model's architecture 
leverages transformer-based attention mechanisms to prioritize crucial data 
points. A series of experiments were conducted on a treadmill with five 
participants to validate the model's performance.
RESULTS: The iP3T model consistently outperformed traditional single-modality 
approaches. In the post-stance phase, the model achieved an RMSE of 1.073 and an 
R2 of 0.985. The integration of multimodal data enhanced prediction accuracy and 
reduced metabolic cost during assisted treadmill walking.
DISCUSSION: The study highlights the critical role of each sensor type in 
providing a holistic understanding of the gait cycle. The attention mechanisms 
within the iP3T model contribute to its interpretability, allowing for effective 
optimization of sensor configurations and ultimately improving mobility and 
quality of life for individuals with gait impairments.

Reduced propulsion of the paretic leg contributes to impaired walking in people 
poststroke. The goal of this study was to determine whether phasic electrical 
stimulation to the paretic gastrocnemius muscle combined with resistance applied 
to the nonparetic leg during swing phase while walking would enhance muscle 
activation of the paretic gastrocnemius and propulsive force of the paretic leg. 
Fifteen individuals who had a stroke visited the lab once to complete two 
experimental sessions (i.e., crossover design; session order randomized). Each 
session consisted of 1) treadmill walking with either ""motor stimulation and 
swing resistance"" or ""swing resistance only"" (10-min walking: 1-min baseline, 
7-min adaptation to intervention, and 2-min postadaptation) and 2) instrumented 
treadmill walking before and after treadmill walking. Participants showed 
enhanced muscle activation of the paretic gastrocnemius (P = 0.03) and improved 
anteroposterior ground reaction force of the paretic leg (P = 0.01) immediately 
after the treadmill walking with ""motor stimulation and swing resistance,"" 
whereas no improvements after the walking with ""swing resistance only."" Those 
enhanced gastrocnemius muscle activation (P = 0.02) and improved ground reaction 
force (P = 0.03) were retained until the late postadaptation period and 10 min 
after treadmill walking, respectively. Walking with ""motor stimulation and swing 
resistance"" may enhance forced use of the paretic leg and improve propulsive 
force of the paretic leg. Applying phasic electrical stimulation to the paretic 
gastrocnemius muscle and swing resistance to the nonparetic leg during walking 
can be used as a novel intervention strategy to improve motor control of the 
paretic leg and walking in people poststroke.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Applying targeted 
motor stimulation to the paretic calf muscle and swing resistance to the 
nonparetic leg during walking induced significant enhancement in muscle 
activation of the paretic gastrocnemius and anterior-posterior ground reaction 
force of the paretic leg, whereas no enhancements were observed after walking 
with swing resistance only. Furthermore, the enhanced gastrocnemius muscle 
activation and ground reaction force of the paretic leg were partially retained 
at the late postadaptation period and 10 min after treadmill walking.

BACKGROUND: Treadmills have been used in laboratories to assess various measures 
related to walking and running. However, there has been some skepticism 
regarding their reliability as a representation of outdoor running. While 
marathon running has gained popularity as a form of physical activity, there 
have been few studies examining stride-to-stride variability after distance 
running, especially in relation to the duration and surface of running. This 
study compared stride time and lower limb joint angles during distance treadmill 
running and running over-ground. The hypothesis was that stride-to-stride 
variability would be influenced by running duration and surface, with greater 
variability observed during outdoor running.
METHODS: Eleven runners participated in the study, running on a treadmill and 
over-ground for 31 minutes at their preferred speed. Inertial measurement units 
were used to measure stride time, total range of motion, and joint angles of the 
hip, knee, and ankle in different phases of the gait cycle in the sagittal plane 
movements. Mean and coefficient of variation of each parameter were compared 
between the initial and final 5 minutes of running on the treadmill and 
over-ground.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in stride time or its variability 
based on running duration or surface. However, mean and variability of certain 
lower limb joint angles were higher during outdoor running, supporting the 
hypothesis. Variability was higher in the initial duration of running as 
compared to final phase of running.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that treadmill may not fully reflect the 
dynamics of running over-ground. It is important to consider variability in gait 
analysis and research, as well as the potential impact on training and clinical 
practice.

OBJECTIVES: This review aims to summarize the common physiological mechanisms 
associated with both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and musculoskeletal aging 
while also examining the relevant literature on how exercise regulation 
influences the levels of shared myokines in these conditions.
METHODS: The literature search was conducted via databases such as PubMed 
(including MEDLINE), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. The 
searches were limited to full-text articles published in English, with the most 
recent search conducted on 16 July 2024. The inclusion criteria for this review 
focused on the role of exercise and myokines in delaying musculoskeletal aging 
and enhancing cognitive health. The Newcastle‒Ottawa Scale (NOS) was utilized to 
assess the quality of nonrandomized studies, and only those studies with 
moderate to high quality scores, as per these criteria, were included in the 
final analysis. Data analysis was performed through narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: The primary outcome of this study was the evaluation of myokine 
expression, which included IL-6, IGF-1, BDNF, CTSB, irisin, and LIF. A total of 
16 studies involving 633 older adults met the inclusion criteria. The current 
exercise modalities utilized in these studies primarily consisted of resistance 
training and moderate-to high-intensity cardiovascular exercise. The types of 
interventions included treadmill training, elastic band training, aquatic 
training, and Nordic walking training. The results indicated that both 
cardiovascular exercise and resistance exercise could delay musculoskeletal 
aging and enhance the cognitive functions of the brain. Additionally, different 
types and intensities of exercise exhibited varying effects on myokine 
expression.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that exercise mediates the secretion of 
specific myokines, including IL-6, IGF-1, BDNF, CTSB, irisin, and LIF, which 
establish self-regulatory circuits between the brain and muscle. This 
interaction enhances cognitive function in the brain and improves skeletal 
muscle function. Future research should focus on elucidating the exact 
mechanisms that govern the release of myokines, the correlation between the 
intensity of exercise and the secretion of these myokines, and the distinct 
processes by which myokines influence the interaction between muscle and the 
brain.

PURPOSE: With aging, the decline in preferred walking speed (PWS), influenced by 
the increased energy cost of walking (CoW), is a key predictor of morbidity. 
However, the determinants associated with PWS and CoW remain poorly understood, 
especially after 80 yr old. The aim of the study was to characterize the 
amplitude and mechanisms of age-related decline in CoW and PWS in old (OM) and 
very old (VOM) men.
METHODS: Thirty-nine young men (YM; 22.1 ± 3.4 yr), 34 OM (71.7 ± 4.1 yr), and 
23 VOM (85.8 ± 2.7 yr) performed aerobic, neuromuscular, and gait assessments. 
Net CoW was measured on a treadmill. Physical activity (PA) was evaluated by 
questionnaire and accelerometry.
RESULTS: Net CoW was 32% ( P < 0.001), 19% ( P < 0.01), and 26% ( P < 0.001) 
higher in VOM compared with OM for 1.11 m·s -1 , 1.67 m·s -1 , and PWS. Net CoW 
was also 27% ( P < 0.001), 26% ( P < 0.01), and 29% ( P < 0.001) higher in OM 
compared with YM at these speeds. Linear regression stratified by age showed 
that net CoW at PWS was associated with step frequency ( r = 0.79; P < 0.001) 
for OM and with both coefficient of variation of stride mean time ( r = 0.48; P 
< 0.05) and maximal strength of knee extensors ( r = -0.54; P < 0.05) for VOM. 
The same analysis revealed that PWS was correlated with net CoW ( r = -0.56; P < 
0.05) and PA ( r = 0.47; P < 0.05) in VOM.
CONCLUSIONS: The progressive increase in net CoW with age was associated with 
gait and neuromuscular impairments, particularly after the age of 80 yr. This 
increase in net CoW was related to a decrease in PWS in VOM, suggesting an 
adaptation of PWS to compensate for the increase in energy demand. Maintaining a 
high level of PA may potentially delay the age-related decline in PWS despite an 
age-related increase in net CoW.

BACKGROUND: Gait event detection is crucial for assessment, evaluation and 
provision of biofeedback during rehabilitation of walking. Existing online gait 
event detection algorithms mostly rely on add-on sensors, limiting their 
practicality. Instrumented treadmills offer a promising alternative by utilizing 
the Center of Pressure (CoP) signal for real-time gait event detection. However, 
current methods have limitations, particularly in detecting cross-step events 
during perturbed walking conditions.
METHODS: We present and validate a CoP-based algorithm to detect gait events and 
cross-steps in real-time, which combines thresholding and logic techniques. The 
algorithm was evaluated on CoP datasets from healthy participants (age range 
21-61 years), stroke survivors (age range 20-67 years), and people with 
unilateral transtibial amputation (age range 28-63 years) that underwent 
perturbation-based balance assessments, encompassing different walking speeds. 
Detected gait events from a simulated real-time processing operation were 
compared to offline identified counterparts in order to present related temporal 
absolute mean errors (AME) and success rate.
RESULTS: The proposed algorithm demonstrated high accuracy in detecting gait 
events during native gait, as well as cross-step events during perturbed walking 
conditions. It successfully recognized the majority of cross-steps, with a 
detection success rate of 94%. However, some misclassifications or missed events 
occurred, mainly due to the complexity of cross-step events. AME for heel 
strikes (HS) during native gait and cross-step events averaged at 78 ms and 64 
ms respectively, while toe off (TO) AME were 126 ms and 111 ms respectively. A 
statistically significant difference in the algorithm's success rate score in 
detecting gait events during cross-step intervals was observed across various 
walking speeds in a sample of 12 healthy participants, while there was no 
significant difference among groups.
CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm represents an advancement in gait event 
detection on instrumented treadmills. By leveraging the CoP signal, it 
successfully identifies gait events and cross-steps in the simulated real-time 
processing operation, providing valuable insights into human locomotion. The 
algorithm's ability to accommodate diverse CoP patterns enhance its 
applicability to a wide range of individuals and gait characteristics. The 
algorithm's performance was consistent across different populations, suggesting 
its potential for diverse clinical and research settings, particularly in the 
domains of gait analysis and rehabilitation practices.

INTRODUCTION: Aberrant knee mechanics during gait 6 months after anterior 
cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are associated with markers of knee 
cartilage degeneration. The purpose of this study was to compare loading during 
walking gait in quadriceps tendon, bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB), and 
hamstring tendon autograft patients 6 months post-ACLR using loadsol single 
sensor insoles, and to evaluate associations between loading and 
patient-reported outcomes.
METHODS: Seventy-two patients (13 to 40 yr) who underwent unilateral, primary 
ACLR with BPTB, quadriceps tendon, or hamstring tendon autograft completed 
treadmill gait assessment, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 
survey, and the ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) survey 6 ± 1 months 
post-ACLR. Ground reaction forces were collected using loadsols. Limb symmetry 
indices (LSI) for peak impact force (PIF), loading response instantaneous 
loading rate (ILR), and loading response average loading rate (ALR) were 
compared between groups using separate analyses of covariance. Survey scores 
were compared between groups using one-way ANOVAs. The relationships between 
IKDC, ACL-RSI, and LSI were compared using Pearson's product moment correlation 
coefficients.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between graft sources for LSI in 
PIF, ILR, ALR, or impulse. Patient-reported knee function was significantly 
different between graft source groups with the BPTB group reporting the highest 
IKDC scores; however, there was no significant difference between groups for 
ACL-RSI score. There were no significant associations between IKDC score, 
ACL-RSI score, and biomechanical symmetry among any of the graft source groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Autograft type does not influence PIF, ILR, ALR, or impulse during 
walking 6 months post-ACLR. Limb symmetry during gait is not strongly associated 
with patient-reported outcomes regardless of graft source. Loadsols appear to be 
a suitable tool for use in the clinical rehabilitation setting.

Neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis 
(MS), cerebral palsy (CP) and stroke are well-known causes of gait and balance 
alterations. Innovative devices (i.e., robotics) are often used to promote motor 
recovery. As an alternative, anti-gravity treadmills, which were developed by 
NASA, allow early mobilization, walking with less effort to reduce gait energy 
costs and fatigue. A systematic search, according to PRISMA guidelines, was 
conducted for all peer-reviewed articles published from January 2010 through 
September 2023, using the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, PEDro and IEEE 
Xplore. After an accurate screening, we selected only 16 articles (e.g., 5 RCTs, 
2 clinical trials, 7 pilot studies, 1 prospective study and 1 exploratory 
study). The evidence collected in this systematic review reported promising 
results in the field of anti-gravity technology for neurological patients, in 
terms of improvement in gait and balance outcomes. However, we are not able to 
provide any clinical recommendation about the dose and parameters of 
anti-gravity treadmill training, because of the lack of robust high-quality RCT 
studies and large samples. Registration number CRD42023459665.

To reduce breast motion with a bra, we need to understand what drives the motion 
of the breasts, and what variables change as support increases. Quantifying 
breast-torso coordination and movement complexity across the gait cycle may 
offer deeper insights than previously reported discrete time lag. We aimed to 
compare breast-torso coordination and mutual influence across breast support 
conditions during running. Twelve female participants ran on a treadmill at 
10 km h-1 with an encapsulation and compression sports bra, and in no bra. 
Nipple and torso position was recorded. Vector coding, granger causality and 
transfer entropy were calculated within gait cycles. In both bra conditions, a 
greater percentage of gait cycles was spent with the breast and torso in-phase 
(> 90%) compared to no bra running (~ 66%, p < 0.001), with most time spent 
in-phase in the encapsulation versus compression bra (p = 0.006). There was a 
main effect of breast support condition on Granger causality (p < 0.001), both 
from breast to torso and torso to breast. Transfer of information was highest 
from torso to breast, compared to breast to torso in all conditions. Overall, 
these results provide novel insight into the mutual and complex interaction 
between the breast and the torso while running in different bra conditions. The 
approaches presented allow for a greater understanding of bra support conditions 
than existing discrete measures, which may relate to comfort and performance. 
Therefore, measures of coupling, predictability and transfer of complexity 
should be employed in future work examining these features.

Three-dimensional gait analysis is the 'gold standard' for measurement and 
description of gait. Gait variability can arise from intrinsic and extrinsic 
factors and may vary between walking conditions. This study aimed to define the 
inter-trial and inter-session repeatability in gait analysis data of children 
with cerebral palsy (CP) who were walking in four conditions, namely barefoot or 
with ankle-foot orthosis (AFO), and overground or treadmill. Ten children with 
spastic CP (7♀; 9.9y ± 3.5y; GMFCS-level I-III) were included in this study. 
Overall, we found good to excellent intra-class correlation (ICC)-values and 
favourable standard error of measurement (SEM)-values for the inter-session Gait 
Profile Score (ICC = 0.85-0.98, SEM = 0.45-0.91°) and Gait Variable Scores 
(ICC = 0.85-0.99, SEM = 0.22-1.11°) for the lower-limb joints. Taking the total 
joint-range-of-motion into account, the knee joint showed the most repeatable 
motion (%SEM = 0.5-1.8 %), while ankle motions showed the lowest repeatability 
(%SEM = 0.8 %-3.0 %). For the continuous waveform data, only the ankle joint 
showed repeatability differences between walking conditions, namely, smaller 
SEM-values for the AFO-condition (mean inter-trial = 0.14°; mean 
inter-session = 1.121°) in comparison to the barefoot-condition (mean 
inter-trial = 0.55°; mean inter-session = 2.22°). For all the kinetic 
parameters, the treadmill conditions showed smaller SEM-values in comparison to 
the overground condition. In conclusion three-dimensional gait analysis was 
found to be reliable in all four walking conditions for children with CP. The 
resulting measurement errors can be used as a reference during clinical 
interpretations of gait analyses. Clinical trial registration number: Trial ID

This study investigated the effects of weapon handling on the physiological 
responses and walking-gait kinematics during load carriage. Seventeen soldiers 
completed four twelve-minute bouts of treadmill walking at incremental speeds 
(3.5, 5.5, 6.5 km.h-1 and self-selected) carrying 23.2-kg of additional load, 
while either handling a weapon or not handling a weapon. Physiological, 
perceptual and biomechanical outcomes were measured throughout each trial. A 
weapon-by-speed interaction (p < .05) was observed for hip flexion-extension 
during loading response and mid-swing. Weapon handling elevated (p < .05) 
cardiorespiratory responses at 6.5 km.h-1. Main effects (p < .05) of weapon 
handling were observed for ventilation, oxygen pulse, effort perception, stride 
length and knee flexion-extension during toe-off. No main effects of weapon 
handling were observed for any other biomechanical measures. These findings 
demonstrate that physiological and biomechanical responses to weapon handling 
are likely walking-speed dependent.Practitioner summary: Weapon handling is an 
important part of many load-carriage tasks but is rarely investigated. 
Physiological and biomechanical responses were assessed at incremental speeds 
during load carriage. Despite similar biomechanics, there was greater 
physiological demands at faster walking speeds, suggesting an increased 
contribution from isometric muscle contractions for weapon stabilisation.

The signature of cognitive involvement in gait control has rarely been studied 
using both kinematic and neuromuscular features. The present study aimed to 
address this gap. Twenty-four healthy young adults walked on an instrumented 
treadmill in a virtual environment under two optic flow conditions: normal (NOF) 
and perturbed (POF, continuous mediolateral pseudorandom oscillations). Each 
condition was performed under single-task and dual-task conditions of increasing 
difficulty (1-, 2-, 3-back). Subjective mental workload (raw NASA-TLX), 
cognitive performance (mean reaction time and d-prime), kinematic (steadiness, 
variability, and complexity in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions), 
and neuromuscular (duration and variability of motor primitives) control of gait 
were assessed. The cognitive performance and the number and composition of motor 
modules were unaffected by simultaneous walking, regardless of the optic flow 
condition. Kinematic and neuromuscular variability was greater under POF 
compared with NOF conditions. Young adults sought to counteract POF by rapidly 
correcting task-relevant gait fluctuations. The depletion of cognitive resources 
through dual-tasking led to reduced kinematic and neuromuscular variability and 
this occurred to the same extent regardless of simultaneous working memory (WM) 
load. Increasing WM load led to a prioritization of gait control in the 
mediolateral direction over the anteroposterior direction. The impact of POF on 
kinematic variability (step velocity) was reduced when a cognitive task was 
performed simultaneously, but this phenomenon was not modulated by WM load. 
Collectively, these results shed important light on how young adults adjust the 
processes involved in goal-directed locomotion when exposed to varying levels of 
task and environmental constraints.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The kinematic and 
neuromuscular signatures of cognitive involvement in gait control have rarely 
been studied jointly. We sought to address this issue using gait perturbation 
and dual-task paradigms. The protocol consisted of a fixed-speed treadmill walk 
to which visual and cognitive constraints were applied separately and together. 
The results revealed that young adults optimally regulated their gait to cope 
with these constraints by maintaining relatively stable muscle synergies and 
flexibly allocating attentional resources.

BACKGROUND: Recent research indicates that there is a high prevalence of heart 
failure with preserved ejection fraction in patients with peripheral artery 
disease. We hypothesized that endovascular treatment (EVT) of flow-limiting 
peripheral stenosis improves left ventricular (LV) diastolic function.
METHODS: Thirty patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease and heart 
failure with preserved ejection fraction according to Heart Failure 
Association-preserved ejection fraction score who were scheduled for EVT or 
angiography were investigated at baseline, the day after EVT (n=25) or 
angiography (control, n=5), and at 4 months follow-up. Peripheral hemodynamics 
were determined by the total peripheral resistance, common femoral artery flow, 
and ankle brachial index. Aortic function was measured by arterial compliance, 
augmentation index, and pulse wave velocity. Aortic pulsatile load was estimated 
as the characteristic impedance of the proximal aorta and the magnitude of wave 
reflection (reflection coefficient). LV mass index, LV mean wall thickness, and 
systolic and diastolic function were assessed using echocardiography. 
Patient-centered outcomes were treadmill walking distance and New York Heart 
Association class.
RESULTS: After EVT, peripheral hemodynamics changed significantly with a 
decrease in total peripheral resistance and an increase in common femoral artery 
flow and ankle brachial index. Aortic function improved after EVT, with 
significantly reduced augmentation index and pulse wave velocity and increased 
compliance immediately and at follow-up, resulting in a reduction in aortic 
pulsatile load (characteristic impedance of the proximal aorta and reflection 
coefficient). Concurrently, LV diastolic function improved after EVT compared 
with control, acutely and at follow-up, with increased septal and lateral e´ 
velocities and decreased E/e´ and left atrial volume index. The LV mass index 
and LV mean wall thickness decreased at follow-up. The New York Heart 
Association class and treadmill walking distance improved post-EVT at follow-up. 
Augmentation index, pulse wave velocity, and arterial compliance were identified 
as independent contributors to E/e´.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of flow-limiting iliofemoral stenosis 
reduces aortic pulsatile load and concurrently lowers total peripheral 
resistance. This beneficial effect is associated with an acute and sustained 
improvement of left ventricular diastolic function.

PURPOSE: Individuals with walking impairment, such as those with cerebral palsy, 
often face challenges in leading physically active lives due to the high energy 
cost of movement. Assistive devices like powered exoskeletons aim to alleviate 
this burden and improve mobility. Traditionally, optimizing the effectiveness of 
such devices has relied on time-consuming laboratory-based measurements of 
energy expenditure, which may not be feasible for some patient populations. To 
address this, our study aimed to enhance the state-of-the-art predictive model 
for estimating steady-state metabolic rate from 2-min walking trials to include 
individuals with and without walking disabilities and for a variety of terrains 
and wearable device conditions.
METHODS: Using over 200 walking trials collected from eight prior 
exoskeleton-related studies, we trained a simple linear machine learning model 
to predict metabolic power at steady state based on condition-specific factors, 
such as whether the trial was conducted on a treadmill (level or incline) or 
outdoors, as well as demographic information, such as the participant's weight 
or presence of walking impairment, and 2 minutes of metabolic data.
RESULTS: We demonstrated the ability to predict steady-state metabolic rate to 
within an accuracy of 4.71 ± 2.7% on average across all walking conditions and 
patient populations, including with assistive devices and on different terrains.
CONCLUSION: This work seeks to unlock the use of in-the-loop optimization of 
wearable assistive devices in individuals with limited walking capacity. A 
freely available MATLAB application allows other researchers to easily apply our 
model.

BACKGROUND: Exercise therapy is a recognized non-pharmacological intervention 
for peripheral arterial disease (PAD); however, the effects of combined exercise 
remain under investigation. This study aimed to compare the effects of a 6-month 
combined supervised exercise program (SUP) with a usual care (UC) approach on 
walking ability, physical fitness, and peripheral blood flow in people with PAD 
and claudication.
METHODS: Twenty-three male participants (Age=64.1 ± 6.2years and ABI=0.58±0.07) 
with PAD and claudication were assigned to either the SUP group (n = 10), 
engaging in structured supervised treadmill walking combined with three 
resistance exercises, three times a week, or the UC group (n = 13), receiving 
advice to walk. The primary outcome measure was walking ability, with 
assessments conducted at baseline (M0), after 3 months (M3), and 6 months (M6).
RESULTS: After the 6-month intervention, the SUP group exhibited significant 
improvements in absolute claudication time (ACT, p = 0.045), maximal walking 
time (MWT, p = 0.045), maximal walking distance (MWD, p = 0.027), and pause 
duration (p = 0.045) during the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), when compared to the 
UC group. Over time, a significant increase in walking speed during the 6MWT 
(Speed6MWT, p = 0.001) and walking speed without claudication (SpeedNoC, p < 
0.001) was found, although no significant differences were found between the 
groups. The SUP group increased by 0.8 km/h in both Speed6MWT and SpeedNoC, 
while the UC group increased by 0.3 km/h and 0.6 km/h, respectively. Despite 
claudication consistently occurring at the same time, the SUP group demonstrated 
an improved tolerance to pain or a better understanding of pain, enabling them 
to walk longer distances at higher speeds. A positive effect of SUP was found 
for chair sit-and-reach test (p = 0.023), percentage of fat mass (p = 0.048), 
fat-free mass (p = 0.040), and total body water (p = 0.026), suggesting 
potential benefits attributed to the resistance strength exercises.
CONCLUSION: A 6-month combined treadmill and resistance exercise program 
improved walking ability, walking speed, lower body and lower back flexibility, 
and body composition in people with PAD and claudication.

PURPOSE: To study whether, during typical-level running, non-rear-foot strikers 
(non-RFS) or rear-foot strikers (RFS) presented a similar or different extent of 
neuromuscular fatigue after a prolonged graded run.
METHODS: Sixteen experienced male trail runners (8 non-RFS and 8 RFS) performed 
a 2.5-hour treadmill graded running exercise. Before and after exercise, 
neuromuscular tests were performed to assess neuromuscular fatigue of the 
plantar flexors. Biomechanical gait parameters were acquired with an 
instrumented treadmill, and electromyographic activity of the lower-limb muscles 
was collected as an index of muscle activation.
RESULTS: There were no significant time × foot strike interactions for 
neuromuscular (all P ≥ .742), muscle activation (all P ≥ .157), or biomechanical 
(all P ≥ .096) variables.
CONCLUSIONS: A dominant level running foot-strike pattern did not directly 
affect the extent of neuromuscular fatigue during a prolonged graded run. This 
suggests that no ideal running foot-strike pattern exists to minimize 
neuromuscular fatigue during prolonged-duration races wherein cumulative uphill 
and downhill segments are high, such as in trail running.

Vertical loading rate (VLR) and pelvic floor muscle activity (PFA) increase with 
running velocity, which may indicate a relationship between VLR and PFA. Foot 
strike pattern has been shown to influence VLR while running, but little is 
known about its influence on PFA. Twenty healthy women ran on a treadmill for 2 
conditions: with a rearfoot strike and with a forefoot strike. PFA was measured 
with electromyography. Running kinematics associated with VLR were collected 
using inertial measurement units and tibial accelerometers. Change scores 
between conditions were calculated for average PFA and running kinematics: peak 
vertical tibial acceleration, vertical excursion of the center of mass (VO), and 
cadence. Paired t tests assessed differences between running conditions for all 
variables. Pearson correlations assessed the relationships between changes in 
PFA and running kinematics. PFA was significantly higher during the forefoot 
compared with the rearfoot strike condition. Change in vertical tibial 
acceleration was positively correlated with change in PFA during the right 
stance. Change in cadence was negatively correlated, and change in vertical 
excursion of the center of mass was positively correlated with change in PFA 
during left stance. The average PFA increased during the forefoot strike pattern 
condition. Changes in PFA were correlated with changes in running kinematics 
associated with VLR.

Entrainment emerges when oscillatory movements synchronize with environmental 
stimuli processing. The purpose of this experiment was to assess how 
cognitive-motor entrainment during a dual-task would influence the quality of 
gait and affect episodic long-term memory. Twenty-one participants (22.56 y/o; 
64 % F) walked at preferred paces while listening to 40-item word lists. In 
separate sessions, unique word lists were presented predictably on every fourth 
stride, unpredictably related to stepping, or predictably while standing. Memory 
tests administered 24-hr after encoding revealed that predictable word 
presentation led to better free-recall performance than unpredicted (p = .044); 
recognition memory was not impacted. Gait phase parameters during the predicted 
condition were more stable than the unpredicted condition or baseline 
assessments. Cognitive-motor entrainment may alleviate dual-task costs and 
enhance memory retention.

The role of the cerebral cortex in self-initiated versus sensory-driven 
movements is central to understanding volitional action. Whether the differences 
in these two movement classes are due to specific cortical areas versus more 
cortex-wide engagement is debated. Using wide-field Ca2+ imaging, we compared 
neural dynamics during spontaneous and motorized treadmill locomotion, 
determining the similarities and differences in cortex-wide activation and 
functional connectivity (FC). During motorized locomotion, the cortex exhibits 
greater activation globally prior to and during locomotion starting compared to 
spontaneous and less during steady-state walking, during stopping, and after 
termination. Both conditions are characterized by FC increases in anterior 
secondary motor cortex (M2) nodes and decreases in all other regions. There are 
also cortex-wide differences; most notably, M2 decreases in FC with all other 
nodes during motorized stopping and after termination. Therefore, 
both internally- and externally-generated movements widely engage the cortex, 
with differences represented in cortex-wide activation and FC patterns.

Terrestrial locomotion is a complex phenomenon that is often linked to the 
survival of an individual and of an animal species. Mathematical models seek to 
express in quantitative terms how animals move, but this is challenging because 
the ways in which the nervous and musculoskeletal systems interact to produce 
body movement is not completely understood. Models with many variables tend to 
lack biological interpretability and describe the motion of an animal with too 
many independent degrees of freedom. Instead, reductionist models aim to 
describe the essential features of a gait with the smallest number of variables, 
often concentrating on the center of mass dynamics. In particular, spring-mass 
models have been successful in extracting and describing important 
characteristics of running. In this paper, we consider the spring loaded 
inverted pendulum model under the regime of constant angular velocity, small 
compression, and small angle swept during stance. We provide conditions for the 
asymptotic stability of periodic trajectories for the full range of parameters. 
The hypothesis of linear angular dynamics during stance is successfully tested 
on publicly available human data of individuals running on a treadmill at 
different velocities. Our analysis highlights a novel bifurcation phenomenon for 
varying Froude number: there are periodic trajectories of the spring loaded 
inverted pendulum model that are stable only in a restricted range of Froude 
numbers, while they become unstable for smaller or larger Froude numbers.

INTRODUCTION: Perturbation walking (PW) has been shown to improve gait, however 
its effect on the cortical control of gait might provide insights on neural 
mechanisms underlying falls in adults with osteoarthritis. The objective of this 
study is to investigate the effect of PW on prefrontal cortical (PFC) activation 
in older women with (OA) and without osteoarthritis (HOA). We hypothesized that 
there would be an increase in PFC activation during PW relative to comfortable 
walking (CW) and higher increase in PFC activation during PW in HOA compared to 
OA.
METHODS: Twenty community-dwelling older women (66.7 ± 5.41 years old) walked on 
an instrumented treadmill that provided perturbations at pseudo-random intervals 
between 5-25 s using a counterbalanced design. Functional Near Infrared 
Spectroscopy was used to quantify PFC oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and 
deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) levels, while standing prior to the task as a baseline. A 
linear mixed effects model was conducted to investigate the effects of cohort 
(HOA vs OA), task (PW vs CW), and their interaction on HbO2 (μM) and Hb (μM) 
levels.
RESULTS: HbO2 and Hb levels differed significantly between CW and PW tasks for 
both cohorts (P < 0.001) and demonstrated significant task by cohort interaction 
(P < 0.05). In addition, we found changes in walking performance (stride time, 
stride length, stride width and stance time) during and after PW. Spearman 
correlation demonstrated a strong association between increased stance time, 
increased body mass index and decreased PFC activation during PW. No other 
significant results were found.
DISCUSSION: This study found increase in PFC activation during PW and gait 
adaptation after a short bout of PW in HOA and OA. This increase in PFC 
activation was higher in HOA compared to OA, particularly during PW tasks, and 
was consistent with theory of limitations in mobility affecting neural 
activation in older adults. Further work remains to examine how pain, obesity, 
and mobility impacts cortical control in older adults with and without 
osteoarthritis.

Human-robot physical interaction contains crucial information for optimizing 
user experience, enhancing robot performance, and objectively assessing user 
adaptation. This study introduces a new method to evaluate human-robot 
interaction and co-adaptation in lower limb exoskeletons by analyzing muscle 
activity and interaction torque as a two-dimensional random variable. We 
introduce the interaction portrait (IP), which visualizes this variable's 
distribution in polar coordinates. We applied IP to compare a recently developed 
hybrid torque controller (HTC) based on kinematic state feedback and a novel 
adaptive model-based torque controller (AMTC) with online learning, proposed 
herein, against a time-based controller (TBC) during treadmill walking at 
varying speeds. Compared to TBC, both HTC and AMTC significantly lower users' 
normalized oxygen uptake, suggesting enhanced user-exoskeleton coordination. IP 
analysis reveals that this improvement stems from two distinct co-adaptation 
strategies, unidentifiable by traditional muscle activity or interaction torque 
analyses alone. HTC encourages users to yield control to the exoskeleton, 
decreasing overall muscular effort but increasing interaction torque, as the 
exoskeleton compensates for user dynamics. Conversely, AMTC promotes user 
engagement through increased muscular effort and reduces interaction torques, 
aligning it more closely with rehabilitation and gait training applications. IP 
phase evolution provides insight into each user's interaction strategy 
formation, showcasing IP analysis's potential in comparing and designing novel 
controllers to optimize human-robot interaction in wearable robots.

Plantar shear stress may have an important role in the formation of a Diabetic 
Foot Ulcer, but its measurement is regarded as challenging and has limited 
research. This paper highlights the importance of anatomical specific shear 
sensor calibration and presents a feasibility study of a novel shear sensing 
system which has measured in-shoe shear stress from gait activity on both 
healthy and diabetic subjects. The sensing insole was based on a strain gauge 
array embedded in a silicone insole backed with a commercial normal pressure 
sensor. Sensor calibration factors were investigated using a custom mechanical 
test rig with indenter to exert both normal and shear forces. Indenter size and 
location were varied to investigate the importance of both loading area and 
position on measurement accuracy. The sensing insole, coupled with the 
calibration procedure, was tested one participant with diabetes and one healthy 
participant during two sessions of 15 minutes of treadmill walking. Calibration 
with different indenter areas (from 78.5 mm2 to 707 mm2) and different positions 
(up to 40 mm from sensor centre) showed variation in measurements of up to 80% 
and 90% respectively. Shear sensing results demonstrated high repeatability 
(>97%) and good accuracy (mean absolute error < ±18 kPa) in bench top mechanical 
tests and less than 21% variability within walking of 15-minutes duration. The 
results indicate the importance of mechanical coupling between embedded shear 
sensors and insole materials. It also highlights the importance of using an 
appropriate calibration method to ensure accurate shear stress measurement. The 
novel shear stress measurement system presented in this paper, demonstrates a 
viable method to measure accurate and repeatable in-shoe shear stress using the 
calibration procedure described. The validation and calibration methods outlined 
in this paper could be utilised as a standardised approach for the research 
community to develop and validate similar measurement technologies.

Motor learning involves both explicit and implicit processes that are 
fundamental for acquiring and adapting complex motor skills. However, stroke may 
damage the neural substrates underlying explicit and/or implicit learning, 
leading to deficits in overall motor performance. Although both learning 
processes are typically used in concert in daily life and rehabilitation, no 
gait studies have determined how these processes function together after stroke 
when tested during a task that elicits dissociable contributions from both. 
Here, we compared explicit and implicit locomotor learning in individuals with 
chronic stroke to age- and sex-matched neurologically intact controls. We 
assessed implicit learning using split-belt adaptation (where two treadmill 
belts move at different speeds). We assessed explicit learning (i.e., 
strategy-use) using visual feedback during split-belt walking to help 
individuals explicitly correct for step length errors created by the 
split-belts. After the first 40 strides of split-belt walking, we removed the 
visual feedback and instructed individuals to walk comfortably, a manipulation 
intended to minimize contributions from explicit learning. We used a multirate 
state-space model to characterize individual explicit and implicit process 
contributions to overall behavioral change. The computational and behavioral 
analyses revealed that, compared with controls, individuals with chronic stroke 
demonstrated deficits in both explicit and implicit contributions to locomotor 
learning, a result that runs counter to prior work testing each process 
individually during gait. Since poststroke locomotor rehabilitation involves 
interventions that rely on both explicit and implicit motor learning, future 
work should determine how locomotor rehabilitation interventions can be 
structured to optimize overall motor learning. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Motor learning 
involves both implicit and explicit processes, the underlying neural substrates 
of which could be damaged after stroke. Although both learning processes are 
typically used in concert in daily life and rehabilitation, no gait studies have 
determined how these processes function together after stroke. Using a locomotor 
task that elicits dissociable contributions from both processes and 
computational modeling, we found evidence that chronic stroke causes deficits in 
both explicit and implicit locomotor learning.

Humans can acquire and maintain motor skills throughout their lives through 
motor learning. Motor learning and skill acquisition are essential for 
rehabilitation following neurological disease or injury. Adaptation, the initial 
stage of motor learning, involves short-term changes in motor performance in 
response to a new demand in the person's environment. Repeated adaptation can 
improve skill performance and result in long-term skill retention. Locomotor 
adaptation is extensively studied using split-belt treadmill paradigms. In this 
study we explored whether bidirectional walking (BDW) on a split-belt treadmill 
can induce short-term gait adaptations. Twelve healthy volunteers participated 
in our single session, starting with 2 minutes of normal walking (NW), followed 
by four 5-minute blocks of BDW with a 1-minute passive rest in between blocks, 
and ending with another 2-minute of NW. We recorded body kinematics and ground 
reaction forces throughout the experiment. Participants quickly adapted to BDW 
with both legs showing decreased step lengths. However, only the 
backward-walking leg exhibited aftereffects upon returning to NW, indicating 
short-term adaptation. Notable kinematic changes were observed, particularly in 
hip extension and pelvis tilt, though these varied among participants. Our 
findings suggest that BDW induces unilateral adaptations despite bilateral 
changes in gait, offering new insights into locomotor control and spinal CPG 
organization.

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is often used in poststroke gait 
rehabilitation to address decreased walking speed, foot drop, and decreased 
forward propulsion. However, not all individuals experience clinically 
meaningful improvements in gait function with stimulation. Previous research has 
developed adaptive functional electrical stimulation (AFES) systems that adjust 
stimulation timing and amplitude at every stride to deliver optimal stimulation. 
The purpose of this work was to determine the effects of a novel AFES system on 
functional gait outcomes and compare them to the effects of the existing FES 
system. Twenty-four individuals with chronic poststroke hemiparesis completed 
64-min walking trials on an adaptive and fixed-speed treadmill with no 
stimulation, stimulation from the existing FES system, and stimulation from the 
AFES system. There was no significant effect of stimulation condition on walking 
speed, peak dorsiflexion angle, or peak propulsive force. Walking speed was 
significantly faster and peak propulsive force was significantly larger on the 
adaptive treadmill (ATM) than the fixed-speed treadmill (both p < 0.0001). 
Dorsiflexor stimulation timing was similar between stimulation conditions, but 
plantarflexor stimulation timing was significantly improved with the AFES system 
compared to the FES system (p = 0.0059). Variability between and within subjects 
was substantial, and some subjects experienced clinically meaningful 
improvements in walking speed, peak dorsiflexion angle, and peak propulsive 
force. However, not all subjects experienced benefits, suggesting that further 
research to characterize which subjects exhibit the best instantaneous response 
to FES is needed to optimize poststroke gait rehabilitation using FES.

Purpose: Previous studies have proven that modifications in the natural walking 
technique alter muscle activation and energy consumption. This research aimed to 
determine the differences in muscle activation, energy consumption, kinematic 
characteristics, perceived muscular exertion and perceived cardio-respiratory 
fatigue between natural and modified walking techniques with altered pelvic 
height and rotation. Methods: Nine physically active, non-injured males walked 
on a treadmill. Modified walking techniques assumed maintenance of constant 
pelvic height and application of maximal pelvic rotation. Walking speed was 
subtransit - 0.4 km/h less than the transit. Sampled variables were: average 
normalized maximal activation during contact and swing phase relativized to 
maximal voluntary activation, average submaximal oxygen consumption relativized 
to body mass and subtransit speed, average step length and frequency, rating of 
perceived muscular exertion and perceived cardio-respiratory fatigue. Muscle 
activation, energy consumption and kinematic characteristics were assessed 
throughout each walking session. Perceived muscular exertion and perceived 
cardio-respiratory fatigue were evaluated post-session. Electromyographic 
activity was assessed for rectus femoris, gluteus maximus, vastus medialis, 
biceps femoris, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius lateralis. Results: The most 
significant changes in muscle activation were observed during the contact phase. 
A decrease in pelvic height increased muscle activation of rectus femoris, 
vastus medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis. An increase in pelvic rotation 
increased muscle activation of all monitored muscles except for gluteus maximus. 
Both modifications increased energy consumption, perceived muscular exertion and 
perceived cardio-respiratory fatigue, and altered kinematic characteristics. 
Conclusions: Modifications in pelvic height and rotation at the same walking 
speed alter muscle activation, energy consumption, kinematic characteristics, 
perceived exertion and fatigue.

BACKGROUND: This study examined (i) adaptations in muscle activity following 
perturbation-based balance training (PBT) using treadmill belt-accelerations or 
PBT using walkway trips and (ii) whether adaptations during treadmill PBT 
transfer to a walkway trip.
METHODS: Thirty-eight older people (65+ years) undertook two PBT sessions, 
including 11 treadmill belt-accelerations and 11 walkway trips. Surface 
electromyography (EMG) was measured bilaterally on the rectus femoris (RF), 
tibialis anterior (TA), semitendinosus (ST) and gastrocnemius medial head (GM) 
during the first (T1) and eleventh (T11) perturbations. Adaptations 
(within-subjects - 1st vs 11th perturbations for treadmill and walkway PBT) and 
their transfer (between-subjects - 1st walkway trip after treadmill PBT vs 1st 
walkway trip with no prior training) effects were examined for the EMG 
parameters.
RESULTS: Treadmill PBT reduced post-perturbation peak muscle activation 
magnitude (left RF, TA, ST, right RF, ST, GM), onset latency (right TA), time to 
peak (right RF) and co-contraction index (knee muscles) (P < 0.05). Walkway PBT 
reduced post-trip onset latencies (right TA, ST), peak magnitude (left ST, right 
GM), time to peak (right RF, ST) and pre-perturbation muscle activity (right TA) 
(P < 0.05). Those who undertook treadmill PBT were not different to those 
without prior training during the first walkway trip (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Both treadmill and walkway PBT induced earlier initiation and peak 
activation of right limb muscles responsible for the first recovery step. 
Treadmill PBT also reduced co-contraction of the knee muscles. Adaptations in 
muscle activity following treadmill PBT did not transfer to a walkway trip.

As we age, reliance on the ankle musculature for push-off during walking reduces 
and increased reliance on the hip musculature is observed. It is unclear how 
joint pathology like osteoarthritis may affect this distal-to-proximal 
redistribution of propulsion. Here, we revisited a proof-of-concept study to 
study the effect of split-belt treadmill training, designed to reduce step 
length asymmetry, on forward propulsion during walking. Eleven women with hip 
osteoarthritis and five age-matched control participants walked on an 
instrumented split-belt treadmill at their preferred speed (hip osteoarthritis: 
0.73 ± 0.11 m/s; controls: 0.59 ± 0.26 m/s). Women with hip osteoarthritis had 
less ankle power and propulsive force than controls, and greater hip 
contributions to forward propulsion on their involved limb. Following split-belt 
treadmill training, propulsive force increased on the involved limb. Five of 11 
participants experienced a change in redistribution ratio that was greater than 
the minimal clinically meaningful difference. These ""responders"" had greater 
variability in pre-training redistribution ratio compared to non-responders. 
Women with hip osteoarthritis had poorer propulsive gait mechanics than controls 
yet split-belt treadmill training improved propulsive force. Redistribution 
ratio also changed in participants with high baseline variability. Our results 
suggest that split-belt treadmill training may be beneficial to people with hip 
osteoarthritis who have high variability in walking parameters. Further, the 
age-related shift to increased hip contributions to propulsion across 
populations of older adults may be due to increased variability during walking.

To navigate complex environments, walking animals must detect and overcome 
unexpected perturbations. One technical challenge when investigating adaptive 
locomotion is measuring behavioral responses to precise perturbations during 
naturalistic walking; another is that manipulating neural activity in 
sensorimotor circuits often reduces spontaneous locomotion. To overcome these 
obstacles, we introduce miniature treadmill systems for coercing locomotion and 
tracking 3D kinematics of walking Drosophila. By systematically comparing 
walking in three experimental setups, we show that flies compelled to walk on 
the linear treadmill have similar stepping kinematics to freely walking flies, 
while kinematics of tethered walking flies are subtly different. Genetically 
silencing mechanosensory neurons altered step kinematics of flies walking on the 
linear treadmill across all speeds. We also discovered that flies can maintain a 
forward heading on a split-belt treadmill by specifically adapting the step 
distance of their middle legs. These findings suggest that proprioceptive 
feedback contributes to leg motor control irrespective of walking speed and that 
the fly's middle legs play a specialized role in stabilizing locomotion.

BACKGROUND: Gait training programs are commonly used to improve gait in children 
with cerebral palsy (CP).
OBJECTIVE: To compared the effects of robotic-gait assistant training (RAGT) and 
conventional body weight support treadmill training (CBWSTT) on gait parameters 
among ambulatory children with CP.
METHODS: The study is a randomized controlled trial of 36 children (17 in the 
RAGT group and 19 in the CBWSTT group) aged 5 to 14. Gait training involved 
30-to 35-minute sessions three times per week over eight weeks.
RESULTS: Mixed ANCOVA showed no main effect of time or group on all gait 
parameters (P > .05). Gross motor function measure dimensions D (GMFM D) and E 
(GMFM E) show main effects on step width. Stride length, step length, speed, 
swing phase, and double support phase interacted with GMFM D and E. There was a 
negative correlation between motor function level and the change from baseline. 
Children with lower motor function show a greater change from baseline.
CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences between CBWSTT and RAGT for 
children with CP; however, with gait training interventions, the level of motor 
function should be considered.

Evolutionary and functional adaptations of morphology and postural tone of the 
spine and trunk are intrinsically shaped by the field of gravity in which humans 
move. Gravity also significantly impacts the timing and levels of neuromuscular 
activation, particularly in foot-support interactions. During step-to-step 
transitions, the centre of mass velocity must be redirected from downwards to 
upwards. When walking upright, this redirection is initiated by the trailing 
leg, propelling the body forward and upward before foot contact of the leading 
leg, defined as an anticipated transition. In this study, we investigated the 
neuromechanical adjustments when walking with a bent posture. Twenty adults 
walked on an instrumented treadmill at 4 km h-1 under normal (upright) 
conditions and with varying degrees of anterior trunk flexion (10, 20, 30 and 
40 deg). We recorded lower-limb kinematics, ground reaction forces under each 
foot, and the electromyography activity of five lower-limb muscles. Our findings 
indicate that with increasing trunk flexion, there is a lack of these 
anticipatory step-to-step transitions, and the leading limb performs the 
redirection after the ground collision. Surprisingly, attenuating distal 
extensor muscle activity at the end of stance is one of the main impacts of 
trunk flexion. Our observations may help us to understand the physiological 
mechanisms and biomechanical regulations underlying our tendency towards an 
upright posture, as well as possible motor control disturbances in some diseases 
associated with trunk orientation problems.

Running is the basis of many sports and has highly beneficial effects on health. 
To increase the understanding of running, DSPro® insoles were developed to 
collect running parameters during tasks. However, no validation has been carried 
out for running gait analysis. The aims of this study were to assess the 
test-retest reliability and criterion validity of running gait parameters from 
DSPro® insoles compared to a motion-capture system. Equipped with DSPro® 
insoles, a running gait analysis was performed on 30 healthy participants during 
overground and treadmill running using a motion-capture system. Using an 
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the criterion validity and test-retest 
reliability of spatiotemporal parameters were calculated. The test-retest 
reliability shows moderate to excellent ICC values (ICC > 0.50) except for 
propulsion time during overground running at a fast speed with the 
motion-capture system. The criterion validity highlights a validation of running 
parameters regardless of speeds (ICC > 0.70). This present study validates the 
good criterion validity and test-retest reliability of DSPro® insoles for 
measuring spatiotemporal running gait parameters. Without the constraints of a 
3D motion-capture system, such insoles seem to be helpful and relevant for 
improving the care management of active patients or following running 
performance in sports contexts.

Compensatory changes in brain connectivity keep motor symptoms mild in prodromal 
Parkinson's disease. Studying compensation in patients is hampered by the steady 
progression of the disease and a lack of individual baseline controls. 
Furthermore, combining fMRI with walking is intricate. We therefore used a 
seed-based metabolic connectivity analysis based on 
2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) uptake in a unilateral 6-OHDA rat 
model. At baseline and in the chronic phase 6-7 months after lesion, rats 
received an intraperitoneal injection of [18F]FDG and spent 50 min walking on a 
horizontal treadmill, followed by a brain PET-scan under anesthesia. High 
activity was found in the cerebellar anterior vermis in both conditions. At 
baseline, the anterior vermis showed hardly any stable connections to the rest 
of the brain. The (future) ipsilesional cerebellar hemisphere was not 
particularly active during walking but was extensively connected to many brain 
areas. After unilateral dopamine depletion, rats still walked normally without 
obvious impairments. The ipsilesional cerebellar hemisphere increased its 
activity, but narrowed its connections down to the vestibulocerebellum, probably 
aiding lateral stability. The anterior vermis established a network involving 
the motor cortex, hippocampus and thalamus. Adding those regions to the vermis 
network of (previously) automatic control of locomotion suggests that after 
unilateral dopamine depletion considerable conscious and cognitive effort has to 
be provided to achieve stable walking.

BACKGROUND: Augmenting auditory feedback through an error-augmentation paradigm 
could facilitate the perception and correction of gait asymmetry in stroke 
survivors, but how such a paradigm should be tailored to individual asymmetry 
profiles remains unclear. Before implementing the paradigm in rehabilitation, we 
need to investigate the instantaneous effects of distorted footstep sound 
feedback on gait symmetry in healthy young adults.
METHODS: Participants (n = 12) walked on a self-paced treadmill while listening 
to their footstep sounds, which were distorted unilaterally according to five 
conditions presented randomly: small delay; small advance; large delay; large 
advance; or unmodified (control). The primary outcomes were swing time ratio 
(SWR) and step length ratio (SLR). Secondary outcomes included walking speed, 
bilateral swing time, step length, and maximum toe height, as well as hip, knee, 
and ankle angle excursions.
RESULTS: SWR (p < 0.001) but not SLR (p ≥ 0.05) was increased in all distorted 
feedback conditions compared to the control condition. Increased swing time on 
the perturbed side ipsilateral to feedback distortion was observed in the 
advanced conditions (p < 0.001), while swing time increased bilaterally in the 
delayed conditions (p < 0.001) but to a larger extent on the unperturbed side 
contralateral to feedback distortion. Increases in swing time were accompanied 
by larger maximum toe height as well as larger hip and knee joint excursions (p 
< 0.05 to p < 0.001). No differences in any outcomes were observed between small 
and large feedback distortion magnitudes.
CONCLUSIONS: Distorted footstep sound feedback successfully elicits adaptation 
in temporal gait symmetry (SWR), with distinct modulation patterns for advanced 
vs. delayed footstep sounds. Spatial symmetry (SLR) remains unaltered, likely 
because auditory feedback primarily conveys temporal information. This research 
lays the groundwork to implement personalized augmented auditory feedback in 
neurorehabilitation.

Comparison of community ambulation intensity determined from overground and 
treadmill walking cadence cut points: Is there a relationship between step 
activity measures and predicted VO(2) max in healthy children and adults?

BACKGROUND: This study was designed to evaluate the effect of using maximal 
cadence criteria cut points established during overground and treadmill walking, 
on intensity outputs measured during community ambulation. The second aim was to 
establish the relationship between cardiovascular fitness (predicted VO2 max 
capacity) and community ambulation intensity performance, in typically 
developing individuals.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect on intensity measures when using cadence 
cut point criteria derived from overground and treadmill walking and does 
predicted VO2 max correlate with exercise related community activity in a 
typically developing population?
METHODS: A group of 37 typically developing participants between 8 and 27 years 
of age, underwent a graded submaximal VO2 testing protocol followed by a typical 
week of community ambulation, recorded with a step activity monitor. Maximum 
cadence criteria established during overground and treadmill walking were 
applied and the data were compared. The weekly step activity variables included: 
total steps, total ambulatory time, intensity, duration, and volume. Predicted 
VO2 Max was calculated, and correlations calculated to step activity outputs.
RESULTS: Results showed significant differences (p<0.001) between cadence cut 
point criteria across all intensity measures except in the amount of time spent 
in the 30-60 % intensity category (p=0.182). Predicted VO2 max did not 
significantly correlate with step activity outputs related to exercise 
(moderate+ intensity and long duration ambulatory bouts; p>0.277).
SIGNIFICANCE: This study illustrates the importance of close consideration in 
applying recommended cut off criteria when assessing intensity outputs from step 
activity data. Cadence from both overground and treadmill walking were collected 
in a controlled lab setting, but the influence of the treadmill mechanical and 
forced cadence criteria must be considered when selecting intensity cut points.

Walking in natural environments requires visually guided modifications, which 
can be more challenging when involving sideways steps rather than longer steps. 
This exploratory study investigated whether these two types of modifications 
involve different changes in the central drive to spinal motor neurons of leg 
muscles. Fifteen adults [age: 36 ± 6 (SD) years] walked on a treadmill (4 km/h) 
while observing a screen displaying the real-time position of their toes. At the 
beginning of the swing phase, a visual target appeared in front (forward) or 
medial-lateral (sideways) of the ground contact in random step cycles 
(approximately every third step). We measured three-dimensional kinematics and 
electromyographic activity from leg muscles bilaterally. Intermuscular coherence 
was calculated in the alpha (5-15 Hz), beta (15-30 Hz), and gamma bands (30-45 
Hz) approximately 230 ms before and after ground contact in control and target 
steps. Results showed that adjustments toward sideways targets were associated 
with significantly higher error, lower foot lift, and higher cocontraction 
between antagonist ankle muscles. Movements toward sideways targets were 
associated with larger beta-band soleus (SOL): medial gastrocnemius (MG) 
coherence and a more narrow and larger peak of synchronization in the cumulant 
density before ground contact. In contrast, movements toward forward targets 
showed no significant differences in coherence or synchronization compared with 
control steps. Larger SOL:MG beta-band coherence and short-term synchronization 
were observed during sideways, but not forward, gait modifications. This 
suggests that visually guided gait modifications may involve differences in the 
central drive to spinal ankle motor neurons dependent on the level of task 
difficulty.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This exploratory study suggests a specific and 
temporally restricted increase of central (likely corticospinal) drive to ankle 
muscles in relation to visually guided gait modifications. The findings indicate 
that a high level of visual attention to control the position of the ankle joint 
precisely before ground contact may involve increased central drive to ankle 
muscles. These findings are important for understanding the neural mechanisms 
underlying visually guided gait and may help develop rehabilitation 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: The current lower limb robotic exoskeleton training (LRET) for 
treating and managing stroke patients remains a huge challenge. Comprehensive 
ICF analysis and informative treatment options are needed. This review aims to 
analyze LRET' s efficacy for stroke patients, based on ICF, and explore the 
impact of intervention intensities, devices, and stroke phases.
METHODS: We searched Web of Science, PubMed, and The Cochrane Library for RCTs 
on LRET for stroke patients. Two authors reviewed studies, extracted data, and 
assessed quality and bias. Standardized protocols were used. PEDro and ROB2 were 
employed for quality assessment. All analyses were done with RevMan 5.4.
RESULTS: Thirty-four randomized controlled trials (1,166 participants) were 
included. For function, LRET significantly improved motor control (MD = 1.15, 
95%CI = 0.29-2.01, p = 0.009, FMA-LE), and gait parameters (MD = 0.09, 
95%CI = 0.03-0.16, p = 0.004, Instrumented Gait Velocity; MD = 0.06, 
95%CI = 0.02-0.09, p = 0.002, Step length; MD = 4.48, 95%CI = 0.32-8.65, 
p = 0.04, Cadence) compared with conventional rehabilitation. For activity, LRET 
significantly improved walking independence (MD = 0.25, 95%CI = 0.02-0.48, 
p = 0.03, FAC), Gait Velocity (MD = 0.07, 95%CI = 0.03-0.11, p = 0.001) and 
balance (MD = 2.34, 95%CI = 0.21-4.47, p = 0.03, BBS). For participation, social 
participation (MD = 0.12, 95%CI = 0.03-0.21, p = 0.01, EQ-5D) was superior to 
conventional rehabilitation. Based on subgroup analyses, LRET improved motor 
control (MD = 1.37, 95%CI = 0.47-2.27, p = 0.003, FMA-LE), gait parameters 
(MD = 0.08, 95%CI = 0.02-0.14, p = 0.006, Step length), Gait Velocity 
(MD = 0.11, 95%CI = 0.03-0.19, p = 0.005) and activities of daily living 
(MD = 2.77, 95%CI = 1.37-4.16, p = 0.0001, BI) for the subacute patients, while 
no significant improvement for the chronic patients. For exoskeleton devices, 
treadmill-based exoskeletons showed significant superiority for balance 
(MD = 4.81, 95%CI = 3.10-6.52, p < 0.00001, BBS) and activities of daily living 
(MD = 2.67, 95%CI = 1.25-4.09, p = 0.00002, BI), while Over-ground exoskeletons 
was more effective for gait parameters (MD = 0.05, 95%CI = 0.02-0.08, 
p = 0.0009, Step length; MD = 6.60, 95%CI = 2.06-11.15, p = 0.004, Cadence) and 
walking independence (MD = 0.29, 95%CI = 0.14-0.44, p = 0.0002, FAC). Depending 
on the training regimen, better results may be achieved with daily training 
intensities of 45-60 min and weekly training intensities of 3 h or more.
CONCLUSION: These findings offer insights for healthcare professionals to make 
effective LRET choices based on stroke patient needs though uncertainties 
remain. Particularly, the assessment of ICF participation levels and the design 
of time-intensive training deserve further study.

Ankle-based exoskeletons have demonstrated metabolic benefits during 
steady-state walking; however, variability exists in individual adaptation 
timelines necessary to achieve those benefits. This study assessed timelines for 
metabolic and gait-related adaptation while wearing an ankle-based exoskeleton 
while powered (EXOP) compared to unpowered (EXNP) and no device worn (NOEX). 
Metabolic (VO2) and biomechanics data were collected while 14 participants 
walked on a treadmill at 1.3 m/s for six sessions. To better understand 
variability in responses to wearing exoskeletons, the cohort was divided based 
on the slope of the VO2 response of the first two sessions in the EXOP 
condition, and gait parameters were compared between subgroups. Repeated 
measures analyses of variance revealed a significant (p ≤ 0.001) 10% VO2 
reduction for EXOP compared to EXNP and a non-significant 2.5% reduction for 
EXOP v NOEX. Lack of significant session-based comparisons indicated no 
additional VO2 adaptation; however, significant session-related results for peak 
knee flexion (interaction, p = 0.042) and step width (session main effect, 
p = 0.003) suggest gait-related adaptation continued during the sessions. 
Subgroup results indicated different response profiles to wearing exoskeletons; 
and implications of classifying initial responses based on metabolic response 
are discussed as an approach to understand what drives variation in responses to 
these devices.

Plain Language Summary: After initial training, VO2 reductions were observed 
with an ankle-based exoskeleton during the initial session and those reductions 
were maintained for the remaining sessions. Some gait-related variables 
continued to change over the remaining sessions. Exploratory work based on 
differences between early metabolic responses revealed potential adaptation 
strategy subgroups.

PURPOSE: The prosthetic socket provides the critical interface between 
prosthesis and residuum. The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the 
effect of altering socket-residuum coupling integrity on limb and body control, 
through the use of vacuum-assisted suspension. A secondary purpose was to 
explore the potential use of two measurement tools designed to assess mobility 
in a clinical context.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individuals with unilateral transtibial amputation 
performed intentional sway (n = 7) and treadmill walking (n = 6) tasks at three 
vacuum levels. Sway deviation from a straight-line path to peripheral targets 
was measured using an instrumented balance platform. Step width variability and 
targeting accuracy were measured using an augmented reality treadmill.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in intentional sway performance 
toward the target on the anterior diagonal toward the prosthetic side 
(p = 0.036); higher vacuum levels tended toward less deviation from a 
straight-line path. We found no group differences between total intentional sway 
deviation, step width variability or stepping accuracy across vacuum levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved socket-residuum coupling integrity via vacuum may have 
measurable effects on functional control that warrant further investigation. We 
highlight limitations of the clinical testing paradigms to inform future 
work.Implications for rehabilitationThe fit of the socket is a critical factor 
in the success of lower limb prosthesis use.Vacuum-assisted suspension modifies 
the coupling between the residuum and socket.Changes in socket-residuum coupling 
may lead to measurable differences in control; however, these may be activity 
and person-specific.Clinically intended instrumented tests of movement function 
derived for an intact anatomy should be used with caution when assessing 
prosthesis users.

Whole-body vibration (WBV) may increase musculoskeletal disorder risk among 
workers standing on vibrating surfaces for prolonged periods. Limited studies 
were conducted to comprehend WBV impact on individuals engaged in dynamic 
activities. This study explored the effects of different horizontal WBV 
frequencies on gait parameters, lower limb kinematics, and the cognitive 
response of healthy subjects. Forty participants walked at constant speed on a 
treadmill mounted on a horizontal shaker providing harmonic vibration with an 
amplitude of 1 m/s2 and frequencies 2-10 Hz, with inversely proportional 
amplitudes. A Psychomotor Vigilance Test measured reaction time while a motion 
capture system recorded walking kinematics. ANOVA results revealed no 
significant impact of vibration frequencies on the reaction time. At 2 Hz, 
alterations in gait spatiotemporal parameters were significant, with reduced 
stride length, stride time, step length, and stance time and increased step 
width and cadence. Similarly, gait variability measured by standard deviation 
and coefficient of variation significantly increased at 2 Hz compared to the 
other conditions. Comparably, kinematic time series analyzed through statistical 
parametric mapping showed significant adjustments in different portions of the 
gait cycle at 2 Hz, including increased hip abduction and flexion, greater knee 
flexion around the heel strike, and augmented ankle dorsiflexion. Participants 
exhibited gait kinematic variations, mainly at 2 Hz, where the associated 
mediolateral displacement was higher, as a plausible strategy to maintain 
stability and postural control during perturbed locomotion. These findings 
highlight individuals' complex biomechanical adaptations in response to 
horizontal WBV, especially at lower frequencies, under dual-task conditions.

Individuals with diminished walking performance caused by neuromuscular 
impairments often lack plantar flexion muscle activity. Robotic devices have 
been developed to address these issues and increase walking performance. While 
these devices have shown promise in their ability to increase musculature 
engagement of the lower limbs when used on a treadmill, most have not been 
developed or validated for overground walking and community use. Overground 
walking may limit the effectiveness of robotic devices due to differences in 
gait characteristics between walking terrains and reduced user engagement. The 
purpose of this study was to validate our multimodal robotic gait training 
system for overground walking in individuals with neuromuscular gait 
impairments. This untethered wearable robotic device can provide an ankle 
resistive torque proportional to the users' biological ankle torque. The device 
can also provide audio biofeedback based on users' plantar pressure intending to 
increase ankle power and muscle activity of the plantar flexors. Seven 
individuals with cerebral palsy participated. Participants walked overground and 
on a treadmill with our robotic gait training system in a single testing 
session. Results showed all seven participants to increase peak plantar flexor 
muscle activity, 10.3% on average, when walking with the gait trainer overground 
compared to treadmill. When compared to typical baseline overground walking, 
overground gait trainer use caused individuals to have slightly less knee joint 
excursion (3°) and moderately more ankle joint excursion (7°). This work 
supports our vision of using the wearable robotic device as a gait aid and 
rehabilitation tool in the home and community settings.

AIM: To assess the adaptive response of older adults with a history of falls in 
a single Perturbation-Based Balance Training (PBT) session by examining the 
margin of stability (MoS) and the number of falls.
METHODS: Thirty-two older adults with a history of falls underwent a treadmill 
walking session lasting 20-25 min. During the PBT protocol, participants 
experienced 24 unexpected perturbations delivered in two ways: acceleration or 
deceleration of the treadmill belt, with 12 perturbations in each direction. The 
MoS in the anteroposterior direction was assessed for the first and last 
perturbations of the session, during the perturbation step (N) and the recovery 
step (REC), along with the number of falls during the training session.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in MoS between the 
first and last perturbations (acceleration and deceleration) for steps N and 
REC. Regarding the number of falls, a significant reduction was found when 
comparing the first half with the second half of the training session (p = 
.033). There were 13 falls in the first half and only three in the second half 
of the PBT session.
CONCLUSION: Older adults with a history of falls exhibited an adaptive response 
with a reduction in the number of falls during a single session of PBT despite 
not showing changes in the MoS.

BACKGROUND: Accurate measurement of bone alignment of the knee during walking 
provides ideal clinical information for diagnosis and treatment of knee joint 
disorders. To bring this ideal closer to clinical reality, we developed an image 
matching technique to measure the three-dimensional (3D) position of bones using 
anteroposterior radiography during the stance phase of treadmill walking.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an image matching method for evaluation of 3D 
knee alignment using anteroposterior radiography of artificial femoral and 
tibial bones.
METHODS: The 3D position of each bone was recovered by minimizing the difference 
between the projected outline and the contour of the bone in the anteroposterior 
radiograph. The true value of the position was measured using a 3D coordinate 
measuring machine.
RESULTS: The mean values ± standard deviation and root mean squares (RMS) of 
translation errors were within -1.6 ± 2.1 mm and 2.6 mm, respectively, for 
femur, and 2.1 ± 1.9 mm and 2.8 mm for tibia. The mean values ± standard 
deviation and RMS of errors in rotation were within 0.3 ± 0.7° and 0.7°, 
respectively, for femur, and -0.3 ± 0.9° and 0.9°, respectively, for tibia.
CONCLUSION: Our method is suitable for evaluating 3D knee alignment on 
anteroposterior radiography.

Gait symmetry is one of the most informative aspects describing the quality of 
gait. Many indices have been proposed to quantify gait symmetry. Among them, 
indices focusing on the comparison of the two body sides (e.g., Symmetry Angle, 
SA) and indices based on the analysis of the locomotor act as a whole, dealing 
with the body center of mass (e.g., Symmetry Index, SIBCoM) or lower trunk 
accelerometry (e.g., improved Harmonic Ratio, iHR) have been proposed. 
Remarkably, the relationship between these indices has received little attention 
so far, as well as the influence of gait speed on their values. The aim of this 
study is to investigate this relationship by comparing the SA, SIBCoM, and iHR, 
and to explore the effect of walking speed on these indices. Ten healthy adults 
walked for 60 s on a treadmill at seven different speeds (from 0.28 to 
1.95 m s-1) and simulate an asymmetric gait (ASYM) at 0.83 m s-1. Marker-based 
trajectories were recorded, and the body center of mass 3D trajectory was 
obtained. Simultaneously, lower trunk 3D linear accelerations were collected 
using a triaxial accelerometer. SIBCoM, iHR, and SA were calculated for each 
stride, each anatomical direction, and each condition. Perfect symmetry was 
never displayed in any axes and any indices. Significant differences existed 
between SIBCoM, and iHR in all anatomical directions (p < 0.0001). The walking 
speed significantly affected SIBCoM and iHR values in anteroposterior and 
craniocaudal directions, but not in mediolateral. Conversely, no walking speed 
effect was found for SA (p = 0.28). All three indices significantly 
discriminated between ASYM and the corresponding walking condition (p < 0.05). 
Gait symmetry may differ significantly according to the data source, 
mathematical approach, and walking speed. Healthy individuals display an 
asymmetrical gait and acknowledging this aspect is crucial when establishing 
rehabilitation objectives and assessing the quality of gait in the clinical 
setting.

Age-related effects of immediate and delayed task switching in a targeted 
stepping task.

The ability to quickly adapt steps while walking is pivotal for safe mobility. 
In a previous study of immediate switching between the two stepping tasks, older 
adults (OAs) performed worse than young adults (YAs). However, it remained 
unclear whether this difference was due to an inability to learn the tasks or an 
inability to quickly switch. Therefore, this study investigated treadmill 
walking while performing two targeted stepping tasks in conditions with 
immediate task switching (ITS) versus delayed task switching (DTS). Thirty YAs 
(aged 26.9 ± 3.1 years) and 32 OAs (aged 70.7 ± 7.3 years) were randomly 
assigned to either the ITS (ITS_YAs and ITS_OAs) or the DTS (DTS_YAs and 
DTS_OAs) group. Each group repeatedly switched between Task A (easy) and Task B 
(difficult) and completed three blocks (ABAB). Delayed switching involved 1-min 
breaks between both tasks. Results showed that ITS_OAs exhibited significantly 
more step errors and worse step accuracy, but that DTS_OAs were able to achieve 
a similar performance as YAs. Our findings underline an inability for quick gait 
adaptation during targeted stepping tasks in OAs, but the possibility to learn 
when delayed switching reduces task interference. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)

BACKGROUND: Wildland firefighters (WFFs) regularly face demanding physical and 
environmental conditions during their duties, such as high ambient temperatures, 
challenging terrains, heavy equipment and protective gear. These conditions can 
strain thermoregulatory responses, leading to increased fatigue and posing risks 
to their health and safety. This study examined the effectiveness of two cooling 
interventions during physical activity in hot environments.
METHODS: Eight active male WFFs participated, comparing the effects of wearing a 
cooling vest (VEST) and personal protective equipment removal (PASSIVE) against 
a control condition (PPE). Participants walked on a treadmill at a speed of 
6 km·h-1 for approximately 75-min under hot conditions (30°C and 30% relative 
humidity). Incremental slope increases were introduced every 15 min after the 
initial 20 min of activity, with 5-min passive recovery between each increment. 
Physiological and perceptual parameters were monitored throughout the protocol.
RESULTS: Significant main effects (p < 0.05) were observed in skin temperature 
(36.3 ± 0.2, 36.2 ± 0.4 and 35.4 ± 0.6°C in PPE, PASSIVE and VEST, 
respectively), physiological strain index (5.2 ± 0.4, 5.6 ± 1.1 and 4.3 ± 1.4 in 
PPE, PASSIVE and VEST) and thermal sensation (6.6 ± 0.6, 6.4 ± 0.7 and 5.3 ± 0.7 
in PPE, PASSIVE, and VEST). However, no significant effects of the cooling 
strategies were observed on heart rate, gastrointestinal temperature or 
performance.
CONCLUSION: Despite the observed effects on physiological responses, neither 
cooling strategy effectively mitigated thermal strain in WFFs under the 
experimental conditions tested.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dual-task walking is challenging for people with 
Parkinson disease (PD). Gait performance worsens while executing dual tasks, 
possibly due to a decline in executive function (EF). This study aimed to 
investigate the effects of dual-task training on EF and dual-task cost (DTC) in 
people with PD and to explore whether training-induced changes in EF were 
associated with changes in DTC.
METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial. A total of 28 people with 
PD participated. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group 
(dual-task training) and the control group (treadmill training). Both groups 
received a total of 16 training sessions during the 8 weeks. Assessments were 
conducted at baseline and postintervention. Primary outcomes included EF and 
dual-task cost.
RESULTS: Significant time-by-group interactions were found in executive function 
and DTC. The experimental group showed significant improvement in frontal 
assessment battery (FAB), trail-making test (TMT) part A, Stroop color and word 
test (SCWT), and DTC on speed in cognitive dual-task walking. There was a 
moderate to high correlation between the change values of the FAB, TMT part A, 
SCWT, and the change values of DTC in cognitive dual-task walking.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Compared to treadmill training, dual-task training 
resulted in greater improvements in EF and DTC. Training-induced changes in EF 
were linked to changes in DTC when walking while performing a cognitive task but 
not when walking while performing a motor task.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with body weight-support treadmill training 
(BWSTT) for improving walking function of individuals with chronic incomplete 
spinal cord injury (iSCI). A 4-week, double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled 
pilot study involved 12 sessions of real (10 Hz, 1800 pulses) or sham rTMS 
combined with BWSTT (15-20 min, moderate intensity). Walking independence was 
assessed using the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (WISCI-II). Lower 
extremity motor function (lower extremity motor score [LEMS]) and spasticity, 
sensory function, functional independence (Spinal Cord Injury Measure III 
[SCIM-III]), and quality of life were also assessed. Walking independence 
(WISCI-II) after the 6th session was higher in the BWSTT/rTMS real (n = 7) 
(median change (IQR): 3 (1.5 to 3.5)) than in the sham group (n = 8) (median 
change (IQR): 0 (0 to 0.25), but there was no difference between groups after 
12th session (BWSTT/rTMS real median change (IQR): 4 (2 to 5); BWSSTT/rTMS sham 
median change (IQR): 0 (0 to 3.25). Compared to baseline, LEMS and SCIM-III 
mobility scores were increased after 12 sessions in the BWSTT/rTMS real but not 
in the sham group. Within- and between-group sensory function, functional 
independence, and quality of life remained similar. This preliminary result 
suggests that combining BWSTT with rTMS could lead to earlier gait improvement 
in patients with chronic iSCI.

INTRODUCTION: Approximately 89% of all service members with amputations do not 
return to duty. Restoring intuitive neural control with somatosensory sensation 
is a key to improving the safety and efficacy of prosthetic locomotion. However, 
natural somatosensory feedback from lower-limb prostheses has not yet been 
incorporated into any commercial prostheses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a neuroprosthesis with intuitive 
bidirectional control and somatosensation and evoking phase-dependent locomotor 
reflexes, we aspire to significantly improve the prosthetic rehabilitation and 
long-term functional outcomes of U.S. amputees. We implanted the skin and bone 
integrated pylon with peripheral neural interface pylon into the cat distal 
tibia, electromyographic electrodes into the residual gastrocnemius muscle, and 
nerve cuff electrodes on the distal tibial and sciatic nerves. Results. The 
bidirectional neural interface that was developed was integrated into the 
existing passive Free-Flow Foot and Ankle prosthesis, WillowWood, Mount 
Sterling, OH. The Free-Flow Foot was chosen because it had the highest Index of 
Anthropomorphicity among lower-limb prostheses and was the first anthropomorphic 
prosthesis brought to market. Conclusion. The cats walked on a treadmill with no 
cutaneous feedback from the foot in the control condition and with their 
residual distal tibial nerve stimulated during the stance phase of walking.

BACKGROUND: Beam walking is a highly studied assessment of walking balance. 
Recent research has demonstrated that brief intermittent visual rotations and 
occlusions can increase the efficacy of beam walking practice on subsequent beam 
walking without visual perturbations. We sought to examine the influence of full 
vision removal during practice walking on a treadmill-mounted balance beam. 
Although visual disruptions improved performance of this task, we hypothesized 
that removing visual feedback completely would lead to less balance improvements 
than with normal vision due to the specificity of practice.
METHODS: Twenty healthy young adults trained to walk at a fixed speed on a 
treadmill-mounted balance beam for 30 min, either with, or without, normal 
vision. We compared their balance pre-, during, and posttraining by calculating 
their step-offs per minute and the percentage change in step-offs per minute.
RESULTS: Balance improved in both groups after training, with no significant 
difference in percentage change in step-offs between the normal vision and the 
no vision participants. On average, the no vision participants had twice as many 
step-offs per minute as the normal vision group during training.
CONCLUSION: Although previous experiments show that intermittent visual 
perturbations led to large enhancements of the effectiveness of beam walking 
training, completely removing visual feedback did not alter training 
effectiveness compared with normal vision training. It is likely a result of 
sensory reweighting in the absence of vision, where a greater weight was placed 
on proprioceptive, cutaneous, and vestibular inputs.

Recent reports have suggested that there may be a relationship between 
footstrike pattern and overuse injury incidence and type. With the recent 
increase in wearable sensors, it is important to identify paradigms where the 
footstrike pattern can be detected in real-time from minimal data. Machine 
learning was used to classify tibial acceleration data into three distinct 
footstrike patterns: rearfoot, midfoot, or forefoot. Tibial accelerometry data 
were collected during treadmill running from 58 participants who each ran with 
rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot strike patterns. These data were used as inputs 
into an artificial neural network classifier. Models were created by using three 
distinct acceleration data sets, using the first 100%, 75%, and 40% of stance 
phase. All models were able to predict the footstrike pattern with up to 89.9% 
average accuracy. The highest error was associated with the identification of 
the midfoot versus forefoot strike pattern. This technique required no 
pre-selection of features or filtering of the data and may be easily 
incorporated into a wearable device to aid with real-time footstrike pattern 
detection.

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a common neuromotor intervention 
whereby electrically evoked dorsiflexor muscle contractions assist foot 
clearance during walking. Plantarflexor neurostimulation has recently emerged to 
assist and retrain gait propulsion; however, safe and effective coordination of 
dorsiflexor and plantarflexor neurostimulation during overground walking has 
been elusive, restricting propulsion neuroprostheses to harnessed treadmill 
walking. We present an overground propulsion neuroprosthesis that adaptively 
coordinates, on a step-by-step basis, neurostimulation to the dorsiflexors and 
plantarflexors. In 10 individuals post-stroke, we evaluate the immediate effects 
of plantarflexor neurostimulation delivered with different onset timings, and 
retention to unassisted walking (NCT06459401). Preferred onset timing differed 
across individuals. Individualized tuning resulted in a significant 10% increase 
in paretic propulsion peak (Δ: 1.41 ± 1.52%BW) and an 8% increase in paretic 
plantarflexor power (Δ: 0.27 ± 0.23 W/kg), compared to unassisted walking. 
Post-session unassisted walking speed, paretic propulsion peak, and propulsion 
symmetry all significantly improved by 9% (0.14 ± 0.09 m/s), 28% (2.24 ± 
3.00%BW), and 12% (4.5 ± 6.0%), respectively, compared to pre-session 
measurements. Here we show that an overground propulsion neuroprosthesis can 
improve overground walking speed and propulsion symmetry in the chronic phase of 
stroke recovery. Future studies should include a control group to examine the 
efficacy of gait training augmented by the propulsion neuroprosthesis compared 
to gait training alone.

Genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1 increase vulnerability to 
cognitive and behavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Neurofibromatosis type 1 results from 
loss-of-function mutations in the neurofibromin gene and subsequent reduction in 
the neurofibromin protein (Nf1). While the mechanisms have yet to be fully 
elucidated, loss of Nf1 may alter neuronal circuit activity leading to changes 
in behavior and susceptibility to cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Here 
we show that mutations decreasing Nf1 expression alter motor behaviors, 
impacting the patterning, prioritization, and behavioral state dependence in a 
Drosophila model of neurofibromatosis type 1. Loss of Nf1 increases spontaneous 
grooming in a nonlinear spatial and temporal pattern, differentially increasing 
grooming of certain body parts, including the abdomen, head, and wings. This 
increase in grooming could be overridden by hunger in food-deprived foraging 
animals, demonstrating that the Nf1 effect is plastic and internal 
state-dependent. Stimulus-evoked grooming patterns were altered as well, with 
nf1 mutants exhibiting reductions in wing grooming when coated with dust, 
suggesting that hierarchical recruitment of grooming command circuits was 
altered. Yet loss of Nf1 in sensory neurons and/or grooming command neurons did 
not alter grooming frequency, suggesting that Nf1 affects grooming via 
higher-order circuit alterations. Changes in grooming coincided with alterations 
in walking. Flies lacking Nf1 walked with increased forward velocity on a 
spherical treadmill, yet there was no detectable change in leg kinematics or 
gait. Thus, loss of Nf1 alters motor function without affecting overall motor 
coordination, in contrast to other genetic disorders that impair coordination. 
Overall, these results demonstrate that loss of Nf1 alters the patterning and 
prioritization of repetitive behaviors, in a state-dependent manner, without 
affecting motor coordination.

Motor interference, where new skill acquisition disrupts the performance of a 
previously learned skill, is a critical yet underexplored factor in gait 
rehabilitation post-stroke. This study investigates the interference effects of 
two different practice schedules, applying interleaved (ABA condition) and 
intermittent (A-A condition) pulling force to the pelvis during treadmill 
walking, on lateral pelvis shifting towards the paretic leg in individuals with 
stroke. Task A involved applying resistive pelvis force (pulling towards the 
non-paretic side), and Task B applied assistive force (pulling towards the 
paretic side) at the stance phase of the paretic leg during walking. Sixteen 
individuals with chronic stroke were tested for gait pattern changes, including 
lateral pelvis shifting and spatiotemporal gait parameters, and 
neurophysiological changes, including muscle activity in the paretic leg and 
beta band absolute power in the lesioned cortical areas. A-A condition 
demonstrated increased lateral pelvis shifting towards the paretic side, 
extended paretic stance time and longer non-paretic step length after force 
release while ABA condition did not show any changes. These changes in gait 
pattern after A-A condition were accompanied by increased muscle activities of 
the ankle plantarflexors, and hip adductors/abductors. A-A condition 
demonstrated greater changes in beta band power in the sensorimotor regions 
compared to ABA condition. These findings suggest that while walking practice 
with external force to the pelvis can improve lateral pelvis shifting towards 
the paretic leg post-stroke, practicing a new pelvis shifting task in close 
succession may hinder the performance of a previously obtained lateral pelvis 
shifting pattern during walking.

BACKGROUND: Characterizing the condition of patients suffering from knee 
osteoarthritis is complex due to multiple associations between clinical, 
functional, and structural parameters. While significant variability exists 
within this population, especially in candidates for total knee arthroplasty, 
there is increasing interest in knee kinematics among orthopedic surgeons aiming 
for more personalized approaches to achieve better outcomes and satisfaction. 
The primary objective of this study was to identify distinct kinematic 
phenotypes in total knee arthroplasty candidates and to compare different 
methods for the identification of these phenotypes.
METHODS: Three-dimensional kinematic data obtained from a Knee Kinesiography 
exam during treadmill walking in the clinic were used. Various aspects of the 
clustering process were evaluated and compared to achieve optimal clustering, 
including data preparation, transformation, and representation methods.
RESULTS: A K-Means clustering algorithm, performed using Euclidean distance, 
combined with principal component analysis applied on data transformed by 
standardization, was the optimal approach. Two unique kinematic phenotypes were 
identified among 80 total knee arthroplasty candidates. The two distinct 
phenotypes divided patients who significantly differed both in terms of knee 
kinematic representation and clinical outcomes, including a notable variation in 
63.3% of frontal plane features and 81.8% of transverse plane features across 
77.33% of the gait cycle, as well as differences in the Pain Catastrophizing 
Scale, highlighting the impact of these kinematic variations on patient pain and 
function.
CONCLUSION: Results from this study provide valuable insights for clinicians to 
develop personalized treatment approaches based on patients' phenotype 
affiliation, ultimately helping to improve total knee arthroplasty outcomes.

Robot-Aided Training of Propulsion: Effects of Torque Pulses Applied to the Hip 
and Knee Joint Under User-Driven Treadmill Control.

McGrath RL, Sergi F.

OBJECTIVE: to establish whether torque pulses applied by an exoskeleton to the 
hip and knee joint modulate propulsion mechanics and whether changes in 
propulsion mechanics are sustained after exposure to torque pulses under 
user-driven treadmill control.
METHODS: we applied twelve formulations of torque pulses consecutively over 300 
strides to 22 healthy participants, and quantified the evolution of four outcome 
measures - gait speed (GS), hip extension (HE), trailing limb angle (TLA), 
normalized propulsive impulse (NPI) - before, during, and immediately after 
training.
RESULTS: Metrics of propulsion mechanics significantly changed both during and 
after training. Increases in HE during and after training were observed 
primarily in conjunction with hip/knee flexion pulses during early stance, or 
hip/knee extension during late stance. Increases in NPI during training were 
associated with hip/knee extension during early stance, or knee flexion during 
late stance. Knee flexion during early stance resulted in positive after-effects 
in NPI. Increases in GS were associated with the application of hip flexion 
pulses. Conditions exhibiting the largest positive changes in HE, and not NPI, 
during training resulted in increased GS after training. Analysis of the 
relationship between the effects measured during and after training suggests 
that after-effects primarily arise from retention of training effects, and that 
such retention is amplified compared to fixed-speed training.
CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Combination of exoskeleton training and user-driven 
treadmill control modulates propulsion mechanics both during and after training 
and can be considered for the formulation of propulsion-oriented methods for 
individuals with impairments in propulsion mechanics.

Ballet practice improves neuromuscular and biomechanical responses to an 
unexpected standing-slip in older adults.

Falls and fall-induced injuries are common and consequential in older adults. 
Ballet emphasizes full-body coordination, leg strength, and postural control. 
However, it remains unknown whether ballet can indeed reduce falls in older 
adults. This study examined biomechanical and neuromuscular responses of older 
recreational ballet dancers to an unexpected standing-slip. Twenty older ballet 
dancers (17 females, 3 males) and 23 age- and sex-matched nondancers (19 
females, 4 males) were exposed to an unexpected slip during treadmill standing. 
The slip-faller rate was the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes were 
kinematic measurements, including dynamic gait stability, slip distance, and 
recovery stepping performance (step latency, duration, length, and speed). The 
tertiary outcome was the electromyography latency of leg muscles (bilateral 
tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, rectus femoris, and biceps femoris). 
Fewer dancers fell than nondancers after the standing-slip (45% vs. 83%, P = 
0.005, d = 0.970). Dancers displayed better stability at recovery foot liftoff 
(P = 0.006) and touchdown (P = 0.012), a shorter step latency (P = 0.020), 
shorter step duration (P = 0.011), faster step speed (P = 0.032), and shorter 
slip distance (P = 0.015) than nondancers. They also exhibited shorter latencies 
than nondancers for the standing leg rectus femoris (P = 0.028) and tibialis 
anterior (P = 0.002), and the stepping leg biceps femoris (P = 0.031), tibialis 
anterior (P = 0.017), and medial gastrocnemius (P = 0.030). The results suggest 
that older ballet dancers experience a lower fall risk and are more stable than 
nondancers following an unexpected standing-slip. The greater stability among 
dancers could be attributed to more biomechanically effective recovery stepping, 
possibly associated with the ballet-induced neuromuscular benefit-an earlier leg 
muscle activation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to examine how older 
ballet dancers respond to an unexpected external slip perturbation while 
standing. The results suggest that older ballet dancers experience a reduced 
fall risk after the slip than their nondancer counterparts. The lower fall risk 
can be accounted for by dancers' quicker neuromuscular reactions to the slip 
that result in a more effective recovery step and thus higher stability against

BACKGROUND: Badminton, a dynamic sport, demands players to display exceptional 
physical attributes such as agility, core stability, and reaction time. Backward 
walking training on a treadmill has garnered attention for its potential to 
enhance physical attributes and optimize performance in athletes while 
minimizing the risk of injuries.
OBJECTIVE: By investigating the efficacy of this novel approach, we aim to 
provide valuable insights to optimize training regimens and contribute to the 
advancement of sports science in badminton.
METHODOLOGY: Sixty-four participants were randomized into a control group 
(n = 32) and an experimental group (n = 32). The control group received routine 
exercise training, while the experimental group received routine exercise 
training along with additional backward walking training on the treadmill. Pre- 
and post-intervention measurements were taken for core stability using the Plank 
test, balance using the Star Excursion Balance test, reaction time using the 
6-point footwork test, and agility using the Illinois Agility test.
RESULTS: The results showed that the experimental group demonstrated significant 
improvements in core stability (p < 0.001), balance (p < 0.001), reaction time 
(p < 0.05), and agility (p < 0.001) compared to the control group. The backward 
walking training proved to be effective in enhancing these physical attributes 
in badminton players.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating backward walking exercises into the training regimen 
of badminton players may contribute to their overall performance.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of early detection of 
fatigued gait patterns for older adults through the development of a smart 
portable device.
METHODS: The smart device incorporated seven force sensors and a single inertial 
measurement unit (IMU) to measure regional plantar forces and foot kinematics. 
Data were collected from 18 older adults walking briskly on a treadmill for 
60 min. The optimal feature set for each recognition model was determined using 
forward sequential feature selection in a wrapper fashion through fivefold 
cross-validation. The recognition model was selected from four machine learning 
models through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation.
RESULTS: Five selected characteristics that best represented the state of 
fatigue included impulse at the medial and lateral arches (increased, p = 0.002 
and p < 0.001), contact angle and rotation range of angle in the sagittal plane 
(increased, p < 0.001), and the variability of the resultant swing angular 
acceleration (decreased, p < 0.001). The detection accuracy based on the dual 
signal source of IMU and plantar force was 99%, higher than the 95% accuracy 
based on the single source. The intelligent portable device demonstrated 
excellent generalization (ranging from 93 to 100%), real-time performance 
(2.79 ms), and portability (32 g).
CONCLUSION: The proposed smart device can detect fatigue patterns with high 
precision and in real time.
SIGNIFICANCE: The application of this device possesses the potential to reduce 
the injury risk for older adults related to fatigue during gait.

BACKGROUND: Combining machine learning (ML) with gait analysis is widely 
applicable for diagnosing abnormal gait patterns.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze gait adaptability characteristics in stroke patients, 
develop ML models to identify individuals with GAD, and select optimal 
diagnostic models and key classification features.
METHODS: This study was investigated with 30 stroke patients (mean age 
42.69 years, 60% male) and 50 healthy adults (mean age 41.34 years, 58% male). 
Gait adaptability was assessed using a CMill treadmill on gait adaptation tasks: 
target stepping, slalom walking, obstacle avoidance, and speed adaptation. The 
preliminary analysis of variables in both groups was conducted using t-tests and 
Pearson correlation. Features were extracted from demographics, gait kinematics, 
and gait adaptability datasets. ML models based on Support Vector Machine, 
Decision Tree, Multi-layer Perceptron, K-Nearest Neighbors, and AdaCost 
algorithm were trained to classify individuals with and without GAD. Model 
performance was evaluated using accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), F1-score and 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).
RESULTS: The stroke group showed a significantly decreased gait speed 
(p = 0.000) and step length (SL) (p = 0.000), while the asymmetry of SL 
(p = 0.000) and ST (p = 0.000) was higher compared to the healthy group. The 
gait adaptation tasks significantly decreased in slalom walking (p = 0.000), 
obstacle avoidance (p = 0.000), and speed adaptation (p = 0.000). Gait speed 
(p = 0.000) and obstacle avoidance (p = 0.000) were significantly correlated 
with global F-A score in stroke patients. The AdaCost demonstrated better 
classification performance with an ACC of 0.85, SEN of 0.80, F1-score of 0.77, 
and ROC-AUC of 0.75. Obstacle avoidance and gait speed were identified as 
critical features in this model.
CONCLUSION: Stroke patients walk slower with shorter SL and more asymmetry of SL 
and ST. Their gait adaptability was decreased, particularly in obstacle 
avoidance and speed adaptation. The faster gait speed and better obstacle 
avoidance were correlated with better functional mobility. The AdaCost 
identifies individuals with GAD and facilitates clinical decision-making. This 
advances the future development of user-friendly interfaces and computer-aided 
diagnosis systems.

PURPOSE: Parkinson's disease creates an inability to perform previous learned 
autonomic tasks, such as walking, which worsens with disease progression. 
Recommendations to incorporate exercise at moderate to high intensities for this 
population has been established but there is limited knowledge about its impact 
on clinical based outcomes. The purpose of this research is to investigate the 
effectiveness of a 6-week intensity-driven walking program on clinical-based 
outcomes in individuals with PD.
MATERIALS/METHODS: Five individuals with PD were recruited for this 
single-subject withdrawal design (A-B-A-B) study. 6-minute walk performance and 
other core neurological measures of gait were collected. Intervention phases 
incorporated a 30-minute individualized intensity-driven treadmill walking 
program practiced at 65% or more of ones maximum heart rate. Increased treadmill 
speed, incline, and resistance were manipulated to reach the target heart rate 
zone.
RESULTS: 6-minute walk test within condition visual analysis demonstrated a 
therapeutic change during intervention phases and a countertherapeutic change 
during withdraw periods for all 5 individuals. An abrupt therapeutic effect was 
demonstrated for all individuals between conditions with the percent of 
nonoverlapping data ranging from 70-90%. Band method analysis revealed a range 
of 9-19 sessions two standard deviations above baseline mean performances for 
all individuals.
CONCLUSION: To achieve sufficient walking performance, gait practiced at higher 
intensity levels may provide the optimal solution as an adjunct to standard care 
for individuals with PD who want to improve their walking.

Plain Language Summary: Parkinson’s disease creates an inability to perform 
previous learned autonomic tasks, such as walking, which worsens with disease 
progression.Exercise practiced at higher levels of intensity has been 
recommended to improve clinical based outcomes for the neurological 
population.Walking practice at higher intensity levels can provide a solution to 
improve gait endurance for individuals with Parkinson’s disease.

Gait monitoring using hip joint angles offers a promising approach for person 
identification, leveraging the capabilities of smartphone inertial measurement 
units (IMUs). This study investigates the use of smartphone IMUs to extract hip 
joint angles for distinguishing individuals based on their gait patterns. The 
data were collected from 10 healthy subjects (8 males, 2 females) walking on a 
treadmill at 4 km/h for 10 min. A sensor fusion technique that combined 
accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data was used to derive meaningful 
hip joint angles. We employed various machine learning algorithms within the 
WEKA environment to classify subjects based on their hip joint pattern and 
achieved a classification accuracy of 88.9%. Our findings demonstrate the 
feasibility of using hip joint angles for person identification, providing a 
baseline for future research in gait analysis for biometric applications. This 
work underscores the potential of smartphone-based gait analysis in personal 
identification systems.

BACKGROUND: Perturbation-based balance training (PBT) has shown promising, 
although diverging, fall-preventive effects; however, the effects on important 
physical, cognitive and sociopsychological factors are currently unknown. The 
study aimed to evaluate these effects on PBT at three different time points 
(post-training, 6-months and 12-months) in community-dwelling older adults 
compared with regular treadmill walking.
METHODS: This was a preplanned secondary analysis from a randomised, controlled 
trial performed in Aalborg, Denmark, between March 2021 and November 2022. 
Community-dwelling older adults aged ≥65 were randomly assigned to participate 
in four sessions (lasting 20 min each) of either PBT (intervention) or regular 
treadmill walking (control). All participants were assigned to four testing 
sessions: pretraining, post-training, 6-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up. 
At these sessions, physical, cognitive and sociopsychological measures were 
assessed.
RESULTS: In total, 140 participants were randomly allocated to either the PBT or 
control group. Short-term (pretraining to post-training) between-group 
differences were seen for choice stepping reaction time (-49 ms, 95% CI -80 to 
-18), dual-task gait speed (0.05 m/s, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.09) favouring the PBT 
group. However, these improvements were not sustained at the 6-month and 
12-month follow-up. No significant between-group differences were found in other 
physical, cognitive or sociopsychological factors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that PBT, in the short term, improved choice 
stepping reaction time and dual-task gait speed among community-dwelling older 
adults. Yet, these improvements were not retained for 6- or 12-months. The 
healthy state of the study's population may have imposed a ceiling effect 
limiting the ability to show any clinically relevant effects of PBT.

PURPOSE: To determine whether the application of continuous lateral trunk 
support forces during walking would improve trunk postural control and improve 
gait performance in children with CP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen children with spastic CP participated in this 
study (8 boys; mean age 10.6 ± 3.4 years old). Fourteen of them were tested in 
the following sessions: 1) walking on a treadmill without force for 1-min 
(baseline), 2) with lateral trunk support force for 7-min (adaptation), and 3) 
without force for 1-min (post-adaptation). Overground walking pre/post treadmill 
walking. Five of them were tested using a similar protocol but without trunk 
support force (i.e., control).
RESULTS: Participants from the experimental group showed enhancement in gait 
phase dependent muscle activation of rectus abdominis in late adaptation period 
compared to baseline (P = 0.005), which was retained during the post-adaptation 
period (P = 0.036), reduced variability of the peak trunk oblique angle during 
the late post-adaptation period (P = 0.023), and increased overground walking 
speed after treadmill walking (P = 0.032). Participants from the control group 
showed modest changes in kinematics and EMG during treadmill and overground 
walking performance. These results suggest that applying continuous lateral 
trunk support during walking is likely to induce learning of improved trunk 
postural control in children with CP, which may partially transfer to overground 
walking, although we do not have a firm conclusion due to the small sample size 
in the control group.

Dual-task performance holds significant relevance in real-world scenarios. 
Implicit learning is a possible approach for improving dual-task performance. 
Analogy learning, utilizing a single metaphor to convey essential information 
about motor skills, has emerged as a practical method for fostering implicit 
learning. However, evidence supporting the effect of implicit learning on 
gait-cognitive dual-task performance is insufficient. This exploratory study 
aimed to examine the effects of implicit and explicit learning on dual-task 
performance in both gait and cognitive tasks. Tandem gait was employed on a 
treadmill to assess motor function, whereas serial seven subtraction tasks were 
used to gauge cognitive performance. Thirty healthy community-dwelling older 
individuals were randomly assigned to implicit or explicit learning groups. Each 
group learned the tandem gait task according to their individual learning 
styles. The implicit learning group showed a significant improvement in gait 
performance under the dual-task condition compared with the explicit learning 
group. Furthermore, the implicit learning group exhibited improved dual-task 
interference for both tasks. Our findings suggest that implicit learning may 
offer greater advantages than explicit learning in acquiring autonomous motor 
skills. Future research is needed to uncover the mechanisms underlying implicit 
learning and to harness its potential for gait-cognitive dual-task performance 
in clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: Females with acetabular dysplasia and/or labral tears (hip pain) 
exhibit altered walking kinematics, with studies reporting mixed results in 
sagittal and frontal planes compared to pain-free controls, often conducting 
only discrete analyses and warranting further investigation. The objective of 
this study was to investigate discrete and continuous hip and pelvic kinematics 
between females with and without hip pain in two walking conditions.
METHODS: We collected kinematic walking data from 69 females (35 with hip pain, 
34 controls) using motion capture and an instrumented treadmill in two 
conditions: preferred and fast (125% preferred). We used a general linear model 
and one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping to conduct discrete and 
continuous analyses comparing kinematics between groups, with and without 
adjustment for gait speed.
FINDINGS: The hip pain group walked with reduced peak hip extension (Preferred: 
P = .046, Cohen's d = 0.41; Fast: P = .028, d = 0.48) and greater peak anterior 
pelvic tilt (Preferred: P = .011, d = 0.57; Fast: P = .012, d = 0.58) compared 
to controls. From continuous analyses, the hip pain group walked with reduced 
hip extension during terminal stance (Fast: P = .040), greater anterior pelvic 
tilt throughout (Preferred: P = .007; Fast: P = .004), and greater contralateral 
pelvic drop (Preferred: P = .045) during midstance. Adjusting for speed slightly 
affected p-values, but significance was retained for all prior variables except 
pelvic drop.
INTERPRETATION: Kinematic differences between individuals with and without hip 
pain may provide insight into potential predisposing factors for hip pathology 
and/or compensations for pain or pathological processes. This work furthers 
understanding of altered movement patterns in individuals with hip pain and may 
inform physical therapy treatments.

An unannounced balance loss during walking, i.e., balance perturbation, is a 
stressful event, which changes the activity of the sympathetic nervous system 
(SNS). We examined SNS response to unannounced balance perturbation during 
walking, simulating real-life condition of balance loss. We asked: do 
laboratory-induced unannounced balance losses during walking cause a sympathetic 
response, and-if so-does it habituate after a series of perturbations? 
Thirty-four young adults underwent a series of six successive unannounced 
balance perturbations while walking on a treadmill. Sympathetic activity was 
monitored continuously using electrodermal activity and compared before and 
immediately after each unannounced perturbation. All perturbations elicited a 
significant increase of electrodermal activity (P < 0.001), indicating a phasic 
increase in the sympathetic drive. The relative phasic increase of electrodermal 
activity caused by the first perturbation was significantly higher than the last 
perturbation (P < 0.05). Three different types of electrodermal activity 
behavior were observed: steady-level tonic SNS activity, increased SNS activity, 
and decreased SNS activity. Balance loss during walking triggers phasic SNS 
response, this response habituates after a series of unannounced balance 
perturbations. In addition, three distinct patterns of tonic sympathetic 
activity may imply variations in the ability of the SNS response to habituate 
across individuals.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Up to date, the literature typically 
provides information about sympathetic nervous system activity and relatively 
static balance. We believe that exposing participants to a balance loss during 
walking, i.e., unexpected perturbation, provides a more ecologically valid 
situation to measure sympathetic nervous system response; this provides new and 
vital knowledge that can have a significant impact and understanding of how the 
SNS responds to a loss of balance in a real-life situation.

Plantarflexors provide propulsion during walking and receive input from both 
corticospinal and corticoreticulospinal tracts, which exhibit some 
frequency-specificity that allows potential differentiation of each tract's 
descending drive. Given that stroke may differentially affect each tract and 
impair the function of plantarflexors during walking; here, we examined this 
frequency-specificity and its relation to walking-specific measures during 
post-stroke walking. Fourteen individuals with chronic stroke walked on an 
instrumented treadmill at self-selected and fast walking speed (SSWS and FWS, 
respectively) while surface electromyography (sEMG) from soleus (SOL), lateral 
gastrocnemius (LG), and medial gastrocnemius (MG) and ground reaction forces 
(GRF) were collected. We calculated the intermuscular coherences (IMC; alpha, 
beta, and low-gamma bands between SOL-LG, SOL-MG, LG-MG) and propulsive impulse 
using sEMG and GRF, respectively. We examined the interlimb and intralimb IMC 
comparisons and their relationships with propulsive impulse and walking speed. 
Interlimb IMC comparisons revealed that beta LG-MG (SSWS) and low-gamma SOL-LG 
(FWS) IMCs were degraded on the paretic side. Intralimb IMC comparisons revealed 
that only alpha IMCs (both speeds) exhibited a statistically significant 
difference to random coherence. Further, alpha LG-MG IMC was positively 
correlated with propulsive impulse in the paretic limb (SSWS). Alpha and 
beta/low-gamma bands may have a differential functional role, which may be 
related to the frequency-specificity of the underlying descending drives. The 
persistence of alpha band in plantarflexors and its strong positive relationship 
with propulsive impulse suggests relative alteration of corticoreticulospinal 
tract after stroke. These findings imply the presence of frequency-specific 
descending drives to walking-specific muscles in chronic stroke.

BACKGROUND: Gait disturbances are exacerbated in people with Parkinson's disease 
(PD) during dual-task walking (DTW). Transcranial direct current stimulation 
(tDCS) has been shown to exert beneficial effects on gait performance and 
cortical excitability in PD; however, its combined effects with treadmill 
training (TT) remain undetermined.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of tDCS followed by TT on DTW performance 
and cortical excitability in individuals with PD.
METHODS: Thirty-four PD participants were randomized to dorsal lateral 
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tDCS and TT group (DLPFC tDCS + TT group) or sham tDCS 
and TT group (sham tDCS + TT group) for 50 minutes per session (20 minutes tDCS 
followed by 30 minutes TT), 12 sessions within 5 weeks (2-3 sessions each week). 
Outcome measures included cognitive dual-task walking (CDTW), motor dual-task 
walking (MDTW), usual walking performance, cortical excitability, functional 
mobility, cognitive function, and quality of life.
RESULTS: The DLPFC tDCS + TT group exerted significantly greater improvement in 
CDTW velocity (P = .046), cadence (P = .043), and stride time (P = .041) 
compared to sham tDCS + TT group. In addition, DLPFC tDCS + TT group 
demonstrated a significant increase in resting motor threshold of stimulated 
hemisphere compared with sham tDCS + TT group (P = .026). However, no 
significant differences between groups were found in MDTW performance and other 
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Twelve-session DLPFC tDCS followed by TT significantly improved CDTW 
performance and decreased cortical excitability more than TT alone in 
individuals with PD. Applying DLPFC tDCS prior to TT could be suggested for gait 
rehabilitation in individuals with PD.

There are over 5.3 million Americans who face acquired brain injury 
(ABI)-related disability as well as almost 800,000 who suffer from stroke each 
year. To improve mobility and quality of life, rehabilitation professionals 
often focus on walking recovery soon after hospital discharge for ABI. Reduced 
propulsion capacity (force output of the lower limbs to counteract ground 
reaction forces) negatively impacts walking ability and complicates recovery 
during rehabilitation for brain injured people. We describe a method, using 
backward-directed resistance (BDR) in a robotic-based treadmill device, to allow 
measurement of maximum walking propulsion force (MWPF) that is not otherwise 
possible during overground walking assessment. Our objective was to test the 
construct validity of a maximum walking propulsion force (MWPF) measure that 
reflects a person's propulsive strength against applied BDR, while walking on a 
robotic treadmill-based device for participants with acquired brain injury 
(ABI). Our study enrolled 14 participants with ABI at an in inpatient 
rehabilitation in Galveston, TX from 8/1/21 - 4/31/22. The range of 
weight-adjusted MWPF was 2.6-27.1% body weight (%BW), mean 16.5 ± 8.4%BW, 
reflecting a wide range of propulsive force capability. The strongest 
correlation with overground tests was between the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) 
distance and the MWPF values (r = 0.83, p < 0.001) with moderate correlations 
between the 10-meter walk tests at comfortable (CWS) and fast speeds (FWS). The 
Five Times Sit-to-Stand (used as a standard clinical measure of functional lower 
extremity strength) and MWPF tests were poorly correlated (r = 0.26, p = 0.4). 
Forward model selection included 6-MWT distance, age, and overground CWS as 
significant partial predictors of MWPF. We conclude that this novel MWPF measure 
is a valid representation of maximum propulsive force effort during walking for 
people post-ABI. Additional research could help determine the impact of 
interventions designed to increase propulsive force generation during 
rehabilitation training to improve overground walking performance.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a major cause of motor and cognitive 
disability in children due to injury to the developing brain. Early intensive 
sensorimotor rehabilitation has been shown to change brain structure and reduce 
CP symptoms severity. We combined environmental enrichment (EE) and treadmill 
training (TT) to observe the effects of a one-week program of sensorimotor 
stimulation (EETT) in animals exposed to a CP model and explored possible 
mechanisms involved in the functional recovery.
METHODS: Pregnant Wistar rats were injected with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS - 
200 µg/kg) intraperitoneally at embryonic days 18 and 19. At P0, pups of both 
sexes were exposed to 20' anoxia at 37 °C. From P2 to P21, hindlimbs were 
restricted for 16 h/day during the dark cycle. EETT lasted from P21 to P27. TT - 
15 min/day at 7 cm/s. EE - 7 days in enriched cages with sensorimotor stimulus. 
Functional 3D kinematic gait analysis and locomotion were analyzed. At P28, 
brains were collected for ex-vivo MRI and histological assessment. Neurotrophins 
and key proteins involved in CNS function were assessed by western blotting.
RESULTS: CP model caused gross and skilled locomotor disruption and altered CNS 
neurochemistry. EETT reversed locomotor dysfunction with minor effects over gait 
kinematics. EETT also decreased brain inflammation and glial activation, 
preserved myelination, upregulated BDNF signaling and modulated the expression 
of proteins involved in excitatory synaptic function in the brain and spinal 
cord.
CONCLUSIONS: Using this translational approach based on intensive sensorimotor 
rehabilitation, we highlight pathways engaged in the early developmental 
processes improving neurological recovery observed in CP.

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia and frailty often worsen in older adults because of 
declines in activities of daily living and social connections that are 
associated with chronic diseases and traumatic injuries such as falls and 
fractures. Exercise intervention for sarcopenia can take >3 months to improve 
muscle mass, muscle strength, and walking speed. Thus, a specialized 
intervention system for shorter periods of time is needed. In this study, we 
aimed to evaluate the short-term efficacy of an exercise program using the 
wearable cyborg Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) lumbar type in physical function in 
mobility-limited older adults who do not require transition to long-term care.
METHODS: This randomized, single-blind, parallel-group study involved 79 
community-dwelling older adults with physical frailty or locomotive syndrome 
assigned to an intervention group (n = 40) with the HAL lumbar type exercise 
program or a control group (n = 39) without the exercise program. The 
intervention group underwent trunk training (including trunk and hip flexion, 
standing and sitting from a single sitting position, and squats) and gait 
training (treadmill and parallel bars) twice a week for 5 weeks while wearing 
the HAL lumbar type. The 10-m usual and maximum walking speeds, Timed Up and Go 
test results, 5-times chair-standing test results, 5-question Geriatric 
Locomotive Function Scale (GLFS-5) scores, body-fat percentage, and muscle mass 
were measured before and after the intervention and analyzed using the 
intention-to-treat method.
RESULTS: The intervention (23 % male; mean age, 74.7 ± 4.7 years) and control 
(21 % male; mean age, 75.1 ± 4.1 years) groups did not differ significantly in 
baseline characteristics. Seventy-seven participants completed the program; two 
withdrew for personal reasons. The mean difference (standard error) between the 
groups for the primary outcome (usual walking speed) was 0.35 (0.04) m/s; the 
time-by-group interaction was significant (p < 0.001). Secondary outcomes 
(maximum walking speed, Timed Up and Go test results, 5-times chair-standing 
test results, and GLFS-5 scores) significantly improved in the intervention 
group. Body composition was unchanged in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: A 5-week exercise program using the HAL lumbar type is a promising 
option for community-dwelling older adults with limited mobility who do not 
require nursing care, resulting in clinically meaningful improvements in most 
physical functions within a short period.

BACKGROUND: Among ambulatory people with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI), 
balance deficits are a primary factor limiting participation in walking 
activities. There is broad recognition that effective interventions are needed 
to enhance walking balance following iSCI. Interventions that amplify 
self-generated movements (e.g., error augmentation) can accelerate motor 
learning by intensifying sensorimotor feedback and facilitating exploration of 
motor control strategies. These features may be beneficial for retraining 
walking balance after iSCI. We have developed a cable-driven robot that creates 
a movement amplification environment during treadmill walking. The robot applies 
a continuous, laterally-directed, force to the pelvis that is proportional in 
magnitude to real-time lateral velocity. Our purpose is to investigate the 
effects of locomotor training in this movement amplification environment on 
walking balance. We hypothesize that for ambulatory people with iSCI, locomotor 
training in a movement amplification environment will be more effective for 
improving walking balance and participation in walking activities than locomotor 
training in a natural environment (no applied external forces).
METHODS: We are conducting a two-arm parallel-assignment intervention. We will 
enroll 36 ambulatory participants with chronic iSCI. Participants will be 
randomized into either a control or experimental group. Each group will receive 
20 locomotor training sessions. Training will be performed in either a 
traditional treadmill environment (control) or in a movement amplification 
environment (experimental). We will assess changes using measures that span the 
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 
framework including 1) clinical outcome measures of gait, balance, and quality 
of life, 2) biomechanical assessments of walking balance, and 3) participation 
in walking activities quantified by number of steps taken per day.
DISCUSSION: Training walking balance in people with iSCI by amplifying the 
individual's own movement during walking is a radical departure from current 
practice and may result in new strategies for addressing balance impairments. 
Knowledge gained from this study will expand our understanding of how people 
with iSCI improve walking balance and how an intervention targeting walking 
balance affects participation in walking activities. Successful outcomes could 
motivate development of clinically feasible tools to replicate the movement 
amplification environment within clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: Fall prevention and balance control constitute critical components 
of rehabilitation for stroke survivors. Kneeling training, characterized by its 
low center of gravity focus, has been incorporated into rehabilitation regimens 
to enhance postural control across various pathological conditions. Despite its 
widespread use, empirical evidence substantiating the efficacy of kneeling 
training is limited, particularly in the context of mobility and balance 
improvement for patients who have had a stroke. This study aims to substantiate 
the safety and effectiveness of kneeling training in individuals recovering from 
stroke.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial comparing kneeling training and 
conventional rehabilitation training was conducted, involving sixty-seven 
participants allocated to the Kneeling Training Group (KNT) and the Conventional 
Rehabilitation Group (CVR). The KNT group underwent 30-minute sessions of 
kneeling training, while the CVR group received conventional treadmill walking 
training, both administered six times per week over four weeks. Evaluation 
encompassed the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Lower Extremity (FMA-LE), the Berg 
Balance Scale (BBS), and gait analysis was conducted at baseline, as well as at 
the 2 and 4-week intervals.
RESULTS: Our study established the safety of a 4-week kneeling training program. 
Notably, the KNT group exhibited more pronounced improvements in BBS scores at 
weeks 2 and 4 compared to the CVR group. However, no significant disparities 
emerged in FMA-LE and gait analysis between the two groups. Our findings suggest 
that kneeling training may serve as a viable option for enhancing lower limb 
balance in survivors who have had a stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that kneeling training, characterized by its safety, 
simplicity, and no restrictions on location or equipment, represents a valuable 
therapeutic approach for enhancing walking balance in individuals recovering 
from stroke.

METHODS: In this prospective study, 3-D marker-based KMA (VICON-Nexus, version 
2.12.1, and Procalc, version 1.6; VICON Motion Systems Ltd) was performed on 
healthy dogs (body weight ≥ 20 kg; height at withers > 50 cm) walking on a 
treadmill (study period: November 2022). Simultaneously, dogs were video 
recorded by 1 smartphone (iPhone SE; Apple Inc) at a 1.50-m distance 
perpendicular to the shoulder (60 frames per second; 1,920 X 1,080 pixels) for 
KMA using Kinovea. Joint angle and joint angle velocity of the shoulder, elbow, 
carpus, hip, stifle, and tarsus were calculated for 6 synchronized gait cycles. 
Each gait cycle was divided into 10 increments. The difference between 3-D KMA 
and Kinovea was assessed for each parameter using robust linear mixed-effects 
models.
RESULTS: 34 dogs were included. The estimated joint angle difference between 3-D 
KMA and Kinovea was less than 2° for all shoulder and elbow gait cycle 
increments. For the carpus, hip, stifle, and tarsus, the difference was less 
than 2° in 9, 5, 4, and 4 out of 10 gait cycle increments, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Kinovea provides accurate kinematic data for the shoulder and elbow 
of healthy dogs. Carpal, hip, stifle, and tarsal kinematics were less accurate.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of Kinovea for clinical and research purposes 
remains limited. Future Kinovea-based studies are needed to investigate the 
accuracy of carpal, hip, stifle, and tarsal kinematics.

For time-continuous analysis of gait, the problem of variations in cycle 
durations is resolved by normalizing to the gait cycle, but results depend on 
the definition of the cycle start. Gait cycle normalization ignores variations 
in gait phase durations, which results in averaging and comparing data across 
different phases. We propose gait phase normalization as part of a comprehensive 
method for independently analyzing magnitude and timing differences. First, gait 
phases are identified and differences in absolute and/or relative timing of 
phase durations or any point of interest between conditions or groups are 
analyzed using standard statistics. Next, time-continuous gait data is 
normalized to gait phases, and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is used to 
assess magnitude differences in gait data. This approach is demonstrated on data 
recorded from ten young healthy adults walking on a treadmill at five different 
speeds. Sagittal knee angle was normalized to gait cycle or gait phase using 
five different gait cycle start events. Walking at different speeds resulted in 
significant changes in gait phase durations, highlighting a problem ignored by 
gait cycle normalization. SPM results for knee angle normalized to gait cycle 
varied from normalization to gait phases. Gait phase normalized SPM results were 
robust to the definition of the cycle start, in contrast to gait cycle 
normalized data. The approach of analyzing phase durations and normalizing data 
to gait phases overcomes previous limitations and enables a comprehensive 
analysis of magnitude and timing differences in time-continuous gait data and 
could be readily adapted to other tasks.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to (1) quantify the oxygen consumption 
(VO2) and heart rate (HR) of virtual reality (VR) exergaming in youth, (2) 
compare the physical activity intensity of VR gaming to moderate-intensity 
thresholds, and (3) quantify the game experience and cybersickness of VR gaming, 
compared with traditional gaming. Material and Methods: Youth (N = 28; age, 
9.4 ± 1.2 years) completed 10-minute conditions: seated rest, seated videogame 
Katamari Forever (SVG-KF), treadmill walking (TW) (5.6 km/h, 0% grade), and VR 
exergames Beat Saber (BS) and Thrill of the Fight (TOF) while VO2 and HR were 
collected. Game experience and Child Simulator Sickness Questionnaires were 
collected after gameplay. Results: VO2 and HR for BS (9.1 ± 3.0 mL/kg/min and 
119 ± 15 bpm), TW (17.1 ± 2.4 mL/kg/min and 135 ± 15 bpm), and TOF (16.9 ± 5.4 
mL/kg/min and 145 ± 19 bpm) were significantly higher than that at rest 
(4.2 ± 1.5 mL/kg/min and 94 ± 12 bpm) and for SVG-KF (4.3 ± 1.3 mL/kg/min and 94 
± 12 bpm). BS was light-to-moderate, whereas TW and TOF were of moderate 
intensity based on HR and metabolic equivalents (METs). For game experience, 
SVG-KF (1.6 ± 1.6) was less challenging than BS (3.3 ± 1.0) and TOF (3.1 ± 1.1). 
BS was more visually satisfying (3.5 ± 0.7 vs 2.7 ± 0.9) and required more 
concentration than SVG-KF (3.6 ± 0.7 vs 3.1 ± 1.1). TOF (3.4 ± 0.8) was more fun 
than SVG-KF (2.8 ± 0.7). Two youths (7%) experienced cybersickness symptoms, but 
neither requested to stop play. Oculomotor symptoms (0.6 ± 0.9), although 
minimal, were significantly greater than nausea (0.2 ± 0.5) and disorientation 
(0.3 ± 0.6) in both games. Conclusions: VR exergames provided light- to 
moderate-intensity exercise, challenge, visual stimulation, attention, and fun 
with minimal cybersickness symptoms, compared with conventional gameplay in 
youth.

training status.

Muscular efficiency during exercise has been used to interrogate aspects of 
human muscle energetics, including mitochondrial coupling and biomechanical 
efficiencies. Typically, assessments of muscular efficiency have involved graded 
exercises. Results of previous studies have been interpreted to indicate a 
decline in exercise efficiency with aging owing to decreased mitochondrial 
function. However, discrepancies in variables such as exercise stage duration, 
cycling cadence, and treadmill walking mechanics may have affected 
interpretations of results. Furthermore, recent data from our lab examining the 
ATP to oxygen ratio (P:O) in mitochondrial preparations isolated from NIA mouse 
skeletal muscle showed no change with aging. Thus, we hypothesized that delta 
efficiency (Δ€) during steady-rate cycling exercise would not be altered in 
older healthy subjects compared with young counterparts regardless of biological 
sex or training status. Young (21-35 yr) and older (60-80 yr) men (n = 21) and 
women (n = 20) underwent continual, progressive leg cycle ergometer tests 
pedaling at 60 RPM for three stages (35, 60, 85 W) lasting 4 min. Δ€was 
calculated as: (Δ work accomplished/Δ energy expended). Overall, cycling 
efficiencies were not significantly different in older compared with young 
subjects. Similarly, trained subjects did not exhibit significantly different 
exercise efficiencies compared to untrained. Moreover, there were no differences 
between men and women. Hence, our results obtained on healthy young and older 
subjects are interpreted to mean that previous reports of decreased efficiency 
in older individuals were attributable to metabolic or biomechanical 
comorbidities, not aging per se.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Muscular power is reduced, but 
the efficiency of movement is unaltered in healthy aging.

BACKGROUND: A single bout of aerobic exercise can provide acute benefits to 
cognition and emotion in children. Yet, little is known about how acute exercise 
may impact children's underlying brain networks' resting-state functional 
connectivity (rsFC).
OBJECTIVE: Using a data-driven multivariate pattern analysis, we investigated 
the effects of a single dose of exercise on acute rsFC changes in 
9-to-13-year-olds.
METHODS: On separate days in a crossover design, participants (N = 21) completed 
20-mins of acute treadmill walking at 65-75% heart rate maximum (exercise 
condition) and seated reading (control condition), with pre- and post-fMRI 
scans. Multivariate pattern analysis was used to investigate rsFC change between 
conditions.
RESULTS: Three clusters in the left lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) of the 
frontoparietal network (FPN) had significantly different rsFC after the exercise 
condition compared to the control condition. Post-hoc analyses revealed that 
from before to after acute exercise, activity of these FPN clusters became more 
correlated with bilateral lPFC and the left basal ganglia. Additionally, the 
left lPFC became more anti-correlated with the precuneus of the default mode 
network (DMN). An opposite pattern was observed from before to after seated 
reading.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a single dose of exercise increases 
connectivity within the FPN, FPN integration with subcortical regions involved 
in movement and cognition, and segregation of FPN and DMN. Such patterns, often 
associated with healthier cognitive and emotional control, may underlie the 
transient mental benefits observed following acute exercise in youth.

Purpose: This study aimed to explore the impact of different landing methods on 
leg movement ability and the relationship between various parameters of leg 
movement. Methods: This work parameters including stride, contact time, flight 
time, duty factor, stride angle, vertical stiffness, leg stiffness and peak 
vertical ground reaction force. Thirty healthy subjects voluntarily participated 
in this study. In this experiment, each subject was required to perform two 
tests on a treadmill (using a speed of 10 km/h and 160 spm) (The interval 
between two experiments is 7 days). In the first test, subjects used RFS. In the 
second test, FFS was used. A high-speed video camera was used to collect the 
images and the Kwon3D motion analysis suite was used to process the images in 
this experiment. Results: The findings of this study revealed that runners 
employing the forefoot strike FFS method exhibited several favorable 
characteristics in contrast to those using the rearfoot strike RFS method. These 
included shorter contact time, longer flight time, reduced duty cycle, increased 
stride angle and heightened leg stiffness. Additionally, peak vertical ground 
reaction forces were significantly elevated in females. Conclusions: While rear 
foot strike RFS demonstrates a notable enhancement in leg stiffness among female 
runners with low leg stiffness, it concurrently leads to a significant increase 
in peak vertical ground reaction force and imposes a greater load on the legs. 
However, this phenomenon is not observed among male participants.

BACKGROUND: Gigantocellular reticular nucleus (GRNs) executes a vital role in 
locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury. However, due to its unique 
anatomical location deep within the brainstem, intervening in GRNs for spinal 
cord injury research is challenging. To address this problem, this study adopted 
an extracorporeal magnetic stimulation system to observe the effects of 
selective magnetic stimulation of GRNs with iron oxide nanoparticles combined 
treadmill training on locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury, and explored 
the possible mechanisms.
METHODS: Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles were stereotactically 
injected into bilateral GRNs of mice with moderate T10 spinal cord contusion. 
Eight-week selective magnetic stimulation produced by extracorporeal magnetic 
stimulation system (MSS) combined with treadmill training was adopted for the 
animals from one week after surgery. Locomotor function of mice was evaluated by 
the Basso Mouse Scale, Grid-walking test and Treadscan analysis. Brain MRI, 
anterograde virus tracer and immunofluorescence staining were applied to observe 
the tissue compatibility of SPIO in GRNs, trace GRNs' projections and evaluate 
neurotransmitters' expression in spinal cord respectively. Motor-evoked 
potentials and H reflex were collected for assessing the integrity of cortical 
spinal tract and the excitation of motor neurons in anterior horn.
RESULTS: (1) SPIO persisted in GRNs for a minimum of 24 weeks without inducing 
apoptosis of GRN cells, and degraded slowly over time. (2) MSS-enabled treadmill 
training dramatically improved locomotor performances of injured mice, and 
promoted cortico-reticulo-spinal circuit reorganization. (3) MSS-enabled 
treadmill training took superimposed roles through both activating GRNs to drive 
more projections of GRNs across lesion site and rebalancing neurotransmitters' 
expression in anterior horn of lumbar spinal cord.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that selective MSS intervention of GRNs 
potentially serves as an innovative strategy to promote more spared fibers of 
GRNs across lesion site and rebalance neurotransmitters' expression after spinal 
cord injury, paving the way for the structural remodeling of neural systems 
collaborating with exercise training, thus ultimately contributing to the 
reconstruction of cortico-reticulo-spinal circuit.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with pronated feet often experience altered foot 
biomechanics, leading to increased risk of lower limb injuries. Step width 
modification has been proposed as a potential intervention to improve foot 
alignment during gait.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Does modifying step width influence rearfoot eversion and 
medial longitudinal arch angle (MLAA) in individuals with pronated feet during 
walking and running?
METHODS: Twenty individuals with pronated feet underwent analysis during walking 
and running on treadmill, maintaining increased or decreased step width using 
real-time visual feedback. Three-dimensional motion analysis measured rearfoot 
eversion and MLAA during the stance phase of gait.
RESULTS: Wide step width significantly reduced peak rearfoot eversion during 
waking (mean difference - with normal step width - (MD) = 3.6°, p < 0.001) and 
running (MD = 4.4°, p < 0.001), time to peak rearfoot eversion during walking 
(MD = 16.6 p < 0.001) and running (MD = 13.8°, p = 0.014), rearfoot eversion at 
touch down (TD) during walking (MD = 1.3°, p = 0.004), rearfoot eversion 
excursion during running (MD = 4.3°, p < 0.001), and peak MLAA during walking 
(MD = 2.9°, p = 0.006) and MLAA excursion during running (MD = 4.8°, p = 0.004). 
By contrast, during running, narrow condition significantly increased peak 
rearfoot eversion (MD = 3.4°, p < 0.001). During walking, time to peak rearfoot 
eversion (MD = 16.1, p < 0.001), rearfoot eversion at TD (MD = 1.4°, p = 0.008), 
rearfoot eversion excursion (MD = 5.9°, p < 0.001), and peak MLAA (MD = 3.4°, p 
< 0.001) were significantly increased.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights the potential of step width modification as 
a simple yet effective intervention to improve foot biomechanics in pronated 
feet individuals during walking and running. Further research could lead to the 
development of personalized strategies for pronated feet individuals.

BACKGROUND: Slower gait speed may be driven by greater energy deficits and 
fatigability among older adults. We examined associations of walking energetics 
and perceived physical fatigability with gait speed among slower and faster 
walkers. Additionally, we used statistical mediation to examine the role of 
fatigability in the associations of walking energetics and gait speed using the 
Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA).
METHODS: Perceived physical fatigability was assessed using the Pittsburgh 
Fatigability Scale (PFS) Physical score (range 0-50, higher = greater). A 
3-phase cardiopulmonary exercise treadmill test collected peak oxygen 
consumption (VO2peak, mL/kg/min), energetic cost of walking (ECW, mL/kg/m), and 
cost-capacity ratio (VO2/VO2peak*100, %). Slower (<1.01 m/s) versus faster 
(≥1.01 m/s) walkers were classified using median 4-m gait speed. Linear 
regressions and statistical mediation analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Slower walkers had lower VO2peak, higher ECW at preferred walking speed 
(PWS), and greater PFS Physical score compared to faster walkers (all p < .05; 
N = 849). One standard deviation (1-SD) higher VO2peak was associated with 0.1 
m/s faster gait speed, while 1-SD higher ECW PWS, cost-capacity ratio at PWS and 
slow walking speed (SWS), and PFS Physical score were associated with 0.02-0.23 
m/s slower gait speed. PFS Physical score was a significant statistical mediator 
in the associations between VO2peak (15.2%), SWS cost-capacity ratio (15.9%), 
and ECW PWS (10.7%) with gait speed and was stronger among slower walkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Slower walkers may be more influenced by perceptions of fatigue in 
addition to walking energetics. Our work highlights the importance of targeting 
both energetics and perceived fatigability to prevent mobility decline.

Maintaining Cognitive Performance at the Expense of Gait Speed for Asymptomatic 
Concussed Athletes: A Novel Dual-Task and Post-Exercise Assessment.

Our goal was to evaluate persisting deficits in gait and executive functioning 
in asymptomatic athletes with a history of concussion using a novel approach 
combining a dual-task paradigm and post-exercise exertion. Thirty-eight athletes 
aged 17 to 25 years old participated in the study, including 18 with a history 
of concussion. The dual-task paradigm required walking continuously at a 
predetermined self-paced target speed of 6.5 km/h while executing a complex 
switch task. Athletes completed two conditions, each on separate days: (1) dual 
task alone and (2) dual task following 20 min of running on a non-motorized 
treadmill. The statistical analyses revealed a significant reduction in gait 
speed exclusively for athletes with a history of concussion and only following 
the post-exercise condition (p = 0.008). These findings suggest that although 
asymptomatic concussed athletes maintain a cognitive performance comparable to 
non-concussed athletes, this appears to be achieved at the expense of gait 
speed. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating gait assessments 
and post-exercise exertion into concussion evaluation protocols in both research 
and clinical settings.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the pressure distribution and comfort of 
transtibial prosthesis wearers using an affordable ethyl-vinyl acetate (EVA) 
roll-on (AERO) liner.
METHOD: Fifteen unilateral transtibial prosthesis users wore patella tendon 
bearing (PTB) sockets with a polyethylene foam (PE-lite) liner were enrolled 
this study. AERO liners were provided to all participants. Six force sensors 
were applied to the residual limb to evaluate pressure distribution during 
treadmill walking, and the socket comfort score (SCS) was used to evaluate 
comfortability. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed on 
the EVA and PE-lite liners.
RESULTS: Eleven participants used prefabricated AERO liners and four 
participants used custom-made AERO liners. The pressure distribution was 
analysed by the coefficient of variation (CV): PE-lite was 75.7 ± 6.0 and AERO 
liner 83.3 ± 4.1. Residual limb pressure was significantly decreased when using 
the AERO liner (p = .0007), with a large effect size (r = 0.87). Mean SCS was 
7.5 ± 1.3 and 8.9 ± 1.1 for PE-lite and AERO liner respectively.
CONCLUSION: Better pressure distribution and comfort were observed when the 
participants used the AERO liner. AERO had a greater proportion of calcium 
carbonate (CaCO3). These findings suggest that the AERO liner is a better 
off-the-shelf option for persons using traditional prosthetic sockets and 
liners.

BACKGROUND: Exploring the independent effect of mechanical discharge in response 
to weight loss (WL) seems necessary but remains highly challenging from a 
methodological point. Anti-gravity treadmills could be relevant to simulate a 
mechanical WL by body weight support (BWS), but their reliability remains 
unclear to properly explore exercise energy metabolism, especially at low 
degrees of alleviations.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of an 
anti-gravity treadmill to generate BWS, and the reproducibility of 
cardiometabolic responses to an exercise performed at low degrees of BWS on this 
device.
METHODS: Observed BWS of 18 normal-weight males was obtained twice at seven 
degrees of target BWS (i.e., 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18%) using a digital scale 
inside the anti-gravity treadmill, and was compared to the expected BWS. Then, 
15 of them performed 5-min bout of low-intensity walking exercise at these 
degrees of BWS in a randomized order, separated by 4-min rest. The exercise was 
identically repeated on three occasions separated by a minimum of 3 days. Energy 
metabolism and heart rate (HR) were measured throughout the exercise by indirect 
calorimetry and a HR monitor, respectively.
RESULTS: The observed BWS were significantly different from the expected BWS (p< 
0.001), and there was a high inter- and intra-individual variability in BWS 
generated by the anti-gravity treadmill. Results showed an overall good 
reliability of VO2 (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) values ranging 
from 0.67 to 0.85) and HR (ICC > 0.8) in response to exercise. An effect of the 
degree of BWS was observed for VO2 (p< 0.001), illustrating reduced values at 
15% and 18% of BWS compared to 0, 3, and 6%.
CONCLUSIONS: Such device might not be adapted to simulate low degrees of WL in 
normal-weight males, particularly when it comes to the exploration of energy 
metabolism.

Human gait is a complex behavior requiring dynamic control of upper and lower 
extremities that is accompanied by cortical activity in multiple brain areas. We 
investigated the contribution of beta (15-30 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) band 
electroencephalography (EEG) activity during specific phases of the gait cycle, 
comparing treadmill walking with and without arm swing. Modulations of spectral 
power in the beta band during early double support and swing phases 
source-localized to the sensorimotor cortex ipsilateral, but not contralateral, 
to the leading leg. The lateralization disappeared in the condition with 
constrained arms, together with an increase of activity in bilateral 
supplementary motor areas. By contrast, gamma band modulations that localized to 
the presumed leg area of sensorimotor cortex around the heel-strike events were 
unaffected by arm movement. Our findings demonstrate that arm swing is 
accompanied by considerable cortical activation that should not be neglected in 
gait-related neuroimaging studies.

BACKGROUND: The metabolic cost of locomotion is a key factor in walking and 
running performance. It has been studied by analysing the activation and 
co-activation of the muscles of the lower limbs. However, these measures do not 
comprehensively address muscle mechanics, in contrast to approaches using muscle 
moments and co-contraction.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect of speed and type of locomotion on muscle 
moments and co-contraction, and their relationship with metabolic cost during 
walking and running?
METHODS: Eleven recreational athletes (60.5 ± 7.1 kg; 169.0 ± 6.6 cm; 23.6 ± 3.3 
years) walked and ran on a treadmill at different speeds, including a similar 
speed of 1.75 m.s-1. Metabolic cost was estimated from gas exchange 
measurements. Muscle moments and co-contraction of ankle and knee flexors and 
extensors during the stance and swing phases were estimated using an 
electromyographic-driven model.
RESULTS: Both the slowest and fastest walking speeds had significantly higher 
metabolic costs than intermediate ones (p < 0.05). The metabolic cost of walking 
was correlated with plantarflexors moment during swing phase (r = 0.62 at 
0.5 m.s-1, r = 0.67 at 1,25 m.s-1), dorsiflexors moment during stance phase (r = 
0.65 at 1.25 m.s-1, r = 0.67 at 1.5 and 1.75 m.s-1), and ankle co-contraction 
during the stance phase (r = 0.63 at 1.25 and 1.75 m.s-1). The metabolic cost of 
running at 3.25 m.s-1 during the swing phase was correlated with the 
dorsiflexors moment (r = 0.63), plantarflexors moment (r = 0.61) and ankle 
co-contraction (r = 0.60).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Fluctuations in metabolic cost of walking and running 
could be explained, at least in part, by increased ankle antagonist moments and 
co-contraction.

How the neuromechanics of the lower limb functional muscle groups change with 
running speed remains to be fully elucidated, with implications for our 
understanding of human locomotion, conditioning, and injury prevention. This 
study compared the neuromechanics (ground reaction and joint kinetics, 
kinematics and muscle activity) of middle-distance athletes running on an 
instrumented treadmill at six wide-ranging speeds (2.78-8.33 m·s-1). Ground 
reaction forces and kinematics were analyzed using inverse dynamics to calculate 
flexor and extensor joint torques, and positive and negative work done by these 
torques. Contributions of each functional muscle group to the total positive and 
negative work done by the limb during stance, swing, and the whole stride were 
quantified. During stance, the ankle plantar flexors were the major energy 
generator and absorber (>60%) at all speeds, but their contribution to whole 
stride energy generation and absorption declined with speed. Positive work by 
the hip extensors rose superlinearly with speed during stance (3-fold) and 
especially during swing (12-fold), becoming the biggest energy generator across 
the whole stride at >5 m·s-1. Knee flexor and extensor negative work also rose 
superlinearly with speed during swing, with the knee flexors becoming the 
greatest energy absorber over the whole stride at >7.22 m·s-1. Across speeds, 
plantar flexor peak moment and positive work accounted for 97% and 96% of the 
variance in step length, and swing hip extension peak moment and positive work 
accounted for 98% and 99% of the variance in step frequency. There were 
pronounced speed, phase (stance/swing), and work (positive/negative) dependent 
contributions of the different functional muscle groups during running, with 
extensive implications for conditioning and injury prevention.

BACKGROUND: Tendons transmit tensile load from muscles to the skeleton. 
Differential loading across a tendon can occur, especially when it contains 
subtendons originating from distinct muscles. Tendon shear wave speed has 
previously been shown to reflect local tensile stress. Hence, a tool that 
measures spatial variations in wave speed may reflect differential loading 
within a tendon during human movement.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Do wave speeds measured via high-framerate ultrasound-based 
tensiometry correspond with differential loading across a tendon?
METHODS: Ultrasound-tensiometry uses an external mechanical actuator to induce 
waves and high-framerate plane wave ultrasound imaging (20 kHz) to track tissue 
displacements arising from wave propagation within a tendon. Local tissue 
displacements are temporally and spatially filtered to remove high-frequency 
noise and reflected waves. A Radon transform of the spatio-temporal displacement 
data is used to compute the shear wave speed across the tendon. We evaluated 
ultrasound-tensiometry's ability to measure differential loading across a tendon 
using in silico, ex vivo and in vivo approaches. The in silico approach used a 
finite element model to simulate wave propagation along two adjacent subtendons 
undergoing differential loading. The ex vivo experiment measured wave speed in 
adjacent porcine flexor subtendons subjected to differential loading. In vivo, 
we tracked wave speed across the Achilles tendon while a participant performed 
calf stretches to differentially load the subtendons, and while walking on a 
treadmill at 1.5 m/s.
RESULTS: Wave speeds modulated with local tendon stress under both in silico and 
ex vivo conditions, with higher wave speeds observed in subtendons subjected to 
higher loads (6-16 m/s higher at 1.5× load differential). Spatial variations in 
in vivo Achilles tendon wave speeds were consistent with differential subtendon 
loading arising from distinct muscle loads (maximum range: 0-137 m/s, 
resolution: 0.1 mm×0.2 mm, precision: ±0.2 m/s).
SIGNIFICANCE: High-framerate ultrasound-tensiometry tracks spatial variations in 
tendon wave speed, which may be useful to investigate local tissue loading and 
to delineate individual muscle contributions to movement.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant disruptions in chronic 
disease care and forced people to stay at home. The effects of such issues on 
outpatients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) remain unknown. 
Patients and methods: Single-centre, retrospective-prospective study conducted 
in a Swiss University Hospital. Patients with PAD were included between May 1 
and July 31, 2020, with a follow-up visit at 12 months. Upon both visits, the 
Leriche-Fontaine PAD stage was recorded, and study participants underwent 
ankle-brachial index (ABI) calculation to assess limb perfusion. Functional 
capacities were assessed through the 6-minute walking and treadmill tests. Major 
adverse cardiovascular (MACE) and limb events (MALE) were recorded. Data 
collected during the pandemic were compared with the pre-pandemic period 
(January 1, 2019-April 30, 2020). Results: Overall, 259 patients were included. 
Mean age was 69 years and male sex was prevalent (69.1%). Odds of experiencing a 
degradation in PAD stage were lower during the pandemic than before (odds ratio 
[OR]: 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.87; p = 0.018). No significant 
difference was found between periods in terms of ABI trends. Both pain-free 
walking time at treadmill test (p = 0.003) and maximal pain intensity at 
6-minute walking test (p = 0.001) significantly improved during the pandemic. 
Compared with the pre-pandemic period, during the pandemic patients were 
hospitalized less frequently (p = 0.028) and were less likely to undergo 
elective limb revascularization (p<0.001). No significant difference was found 
between periods in terms of MALE (p = 0.311), whereas non-fatal strokes were 
less frequently reported during the pandemic (p = 0.043). Conclusion: In a 
cohort of outpatients with PAD, we found no evidence of clinical deterioration 
during the pandemic compared with the pre-pandemic period, though rates of 
adverse events were nonnegligible in both periods. In case of future pandemics, 
patients with PAD should be encouraged to maintain an active lifestyle while 
being closely monitored to avoid clinical worsening.

Our nervous system has the remarkable ability to adapt our gait to accommodate 
changes in our body or surroundings. However, our adapted walking patterns often 
generalize only partially (or not at all) between different contexts. Here, we 
sought to understand how the nervous system generalizes adapted gait patterns 
from one context to another. Through a series of split-belt treadmill walking 
experiments, we evaluated different mechanistic hypotheses to explain the 
partial generalization of adapted gait patterns from split-belt treadmill to 
overground walking. In support of the credit assignment hypothesis, our 
experiments revealed the central finding that adaptation involves recalibration 
of two distinct forward models. Recalibration of the first model generalizes to 
overground walking, suggesting that the model represents the general movement 
dynamics of our body. On the other hand, recalibration of the second model does 
not generalize to overground walking, suggesting the model represents dynamics 
specific to treadmill walking. These findings reveal that there is a predefined 
portion of forward model recalibration that generalizes across context, leading 
to overall partial generalization of walking adaptation.

AIMS: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the predictability 
of fronto-parallel trunk rotations (lateral body sway) could serve as a frame of 
reference to monitor recovery after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: Before surgery, 11 TKA patients were asked to perform a treadmill 
walking task at three different speeds. In addition, their gait abilities were 
scored on three standard clinical walking tests. The treadmill walking task was 
repeated at three different timepoints following surgery, i.e., at 3, 6 and 
12 months post-TKA. The movements of the trunk were digitized with an inertial 
sensor to capture the amplitude and the sample entropy (SEn) of the lateral body 
sway that were evaluated in separate ANOVAs.
RESULTS: Before surgery the TKA group showed larger body sway (P = 0.025) with 
smaller SEn values (P = 0.038), which both restored to levels of healthy adults 
in the 12 months following surgery. Systematic correlations between the SEn 
values and the clinical test scores were found.
CONCLUSIONS: The current findings show that movement behavior of the trunk in 
the fronto-parallel plane was affected by knee osteoarthritis and suggest that 
the predictability of the lateral body sway may serve as an index of recovery 
after TKA.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a prevalent vascular disorder 
characterized by atherosclerotic occlusion of peripheral arteries, resulting in 
reduced blood flow to the lower extremities and poor walking ability. Older 
patients with PAD are also at a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular 
events, including myocardial infarction. Recent evidence indicates that 
inorganic nitrate supplementation, which is abundant in certain vegetables, 
augments nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and may have beneficial effects on 
walking, blood pressure, and vascular function in patients with PAD.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if short-term nitrate supplementation (via 
beetroot juice) improves peak treadmill time and coronary hyperemic responses to 
plantar flexion exercise relative to placebo (nitrate-depleted juice) in older 
patients with PAD. The primary endpoints were peak treadmill time and the peak 
coronary hyperemic response to plantar flexion exercise.
METHODS: Eleven PAD patients (52-80 yr.; 9 men/2 women; Fontaine stage II) were 
randomized (double-blind) to either nitrate-rich (Beet-IT, 0.3 g inorganic 
nitrate twice/day; BRnitrate) or nitrate-depleted (Beet-IT, 0.04 g inorganic 
nitrate twice/day, BRplacebo) beetroot juice for 4 to 6 days, followed by a 
washout of 7 to 14 days before crossing over to the other treatment. Patients 
completed graded plantar flexion exercise with their most symptomatic leg to 
fatigue, followed by isometric handgrip until volitional fatigue at 40% of 
maximum on day 4 of supplementation, and a treadmill test to peak exertion 
1-2 days later while continuing supplementation. Hemodynamics and exercise 
tolerance, and coronary blood flow velocity (CBV) responses were measured.
RESULTS: Although peak walking time and claudication onset time during treadmill 
exercise did not differ significantly between BRplacebo and BRnitrate, the 
diastolic blood pressure response at the peak treadmill walking stage was 
significantly lower in the BRnitrate condition. Increases in CBV from baseline 
to peak plantar flexion exercise after BRplacebo and BRnitrate showed a trend 
for a greater increase in CBV at the peak workload of plantar flexion with 
BRnitrate (p = 0.06; Cohen's d = 0.56).
CONCLUSION: Overall, these preliminary findings suggest that inorganic nitrate 
supplementation in PAD patients is safe, well-tolerated, and may improve the 
coronary hyperemic and blood pressure responses when their calf muscles are most 
predisposed to ischemia.Clinical trial registration:https://clinicaltrials.gov/,

In laboratory settings, human locomotion encounters minimal opposition from air 
resistance. However, moving in nature often requires overcoming airflow. Here, 
the drag force exerted on the body by different headwind or tailwind speeds 
(between 0 and 15 m·s-1) was measured during walking at 1.5 m·s-1 and running at 
4 m·s-1. To our knowledge, the biomechanical effect of drag in human locomotion 
has only been evaluated by simulations. Data were collected on eight male 
subjects using an instrumented treadmill placed in a wind tunnel. From the 
ground reaction forces, the drag and external work done to overcome wind 
resistance and to sustain the motion of the center of mass of the body were 
measured. Drag increased with wind speed: a 15 m·s-1 headwind exerted a drag of 
∼60 N in walking and ∼50 N in running. The same tailwind exerted -55 N of drag 
in both gaits. At this wind speed, the work done to overcome the airflow 
represented ∼80% of the external work in walking and ∼50% in running. 
Furthermore, in the presence of fast wind speeds, subjects altered their drag 
area (CdA) by adapting their posture to limit the increase in air friction. 
Moving in the wind modified the ratio between positive and negative external 
work performed. The modifications observed when moving with a head- or tailwind 
have been compared with moving uphill or downhill. The present findings may have 
implications for optimizing aerodynamic performance in competitive running, 
whether in sprints or marathons.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to 
assess the biomechanical adaptations to a wide range of wind speeds inside a 
wind tunnel. Humans increase their mechanical work and alter their drag area 
(CdA) by adapting their posture when walking and running against increasing head 
and tailwinds. The observed drag force applied to the subject is different 
between walking and running at similar headwind speeds.

IMPORTANCE: Observational data have shown that postdiagnosis exercise is 
associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer death. The feasibility and tumor 
biological activity of exercise therapy is not known.
OBJECTIVE: To identify recommended phase 2 dose of exercise therapy for patients 
with prostate cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center, phase 1a dose-finding 
trial was conducted at a tertiary cancer center using a patientcentric, 
decentralized platform and included 53 inactive men with treatment-naive 
localized prostate cancer scheduled to undergo surgical resection between June 
2019 and January 2023. Data were analyzed in June 2024.
INTERVENTION: Six escalated exercise therapy dose levels ranging from 90 to 450 
minutes per week of individualized, moderate-intensity treadmill walking, 
allocated using adaptive continual reassessment. All exercise therapy sessions 
were conducted remotely with real-time monitoring.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Feasibility was evaluated by relative exercise dose 
intensity (REDI). A dose level was considered feasible if 70% or more of 
patients achieved an REDI of 75% or greater. Activity end points were changes in 
tumor cell proliferation (Ki67) and plasma prostate-specific antigen levels 
between pretreatment and postintervention. Safety and changes in patient 
physiology were also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 53 men were enrolled (median [IQR] age, 61 [56-66] years). 
All dose levels were feasible (≥75% REDI). The mean (95% CI) changes in Ki67 
were 5.0% (-4.3% to 14.0%) for 90 minutes per week, 2.4% (-1.3% to 6.2%) for 150 
minutes per week, -1.3% (-5.8% to 3.3%) for 225 minutes per week, -0.2% (-4.0% 
to 3.7%) for 300 minutes per week, -2.6% (-9.2% to 4.1%) for 375 minutes per 
week, and 2.2% (-0.8% to 5.1%) for 450 minutes per week. Changes in 
prostate-specific antigen levels were 1.0 ng/mL (-1.8 to 3.8) for 90 minutes per 
week, 0.2 ng/mL (-1.1 to 1.5) for 150 minutes per week, -0.5 ng/mL (-1.2 to 0.3) 
for 225 minutes per week, -0.2 (-1.7 to 1.3) for 300 minutes per week, -0.7 
ng/mL (-1.7 to 0.4) for 375 minutes per week, and -0.9 ng/mL (-2.4 to 0.7) for 
450 minutes per week. No serious adverse events were observed. Overall, 225 
minutes per week (approximately 45 minutes per treatment at 5 times weekly) was 
selected as the recommended phase 2 dose.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this nonrandomized clinical trial 
suggest that neoadjuvant exercise therapy is feasible and safe with promising 
activity in localized prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: The more accurate we can assess human physical behaviour in 
free-living conditions the better we can understand its relationship with health 
and wellbeing. Thigh-worn accelerometry can be used to identify basic activity 
types as well as different postures with high accuracy. User-friendly software 
without the need for specialized programming may support the adoption of this 
method. This study aims to evaluate the classification accuracy of two novel 
no-code classification methods, namely SENS motion and ActiPASS.
METHODS: A sample of 38 healthy adults (30.8 ± 9.6 years; 53% female) wore the 
SENS motion accelerometer (12.5 Hz; ±4 g) on their thigh during various physical 
activities. Participants completed standardized activities with varying 
intensities in the laboratory. Activities included walking, running, cycling, 
sitting, standing, and lying down. Subsequently, participants performed 
unrestricted free-living activities outside of the laboratory while being 
video-recorded with a chest-mounted camera. Videos were annotated using a 
predefined labelling scheme and annotations served as a reference for the 
free-living condition. Classification output from the SENS motion software and 
ActiPASS software was compared to reference labels.
RESULTS: A total of 63.6 h of activity data were analysed. We observed a high 
level of agreement between the two classification algorithms and their 
respective references in both conditions. In the free-living condition, Cohen's 
kappa coefficients were 0.86 for SENS and 0.92 for ActiPASS. The mean balanced 
accuracy ranged from 0.81 (cycling) to 0.99 (running) for SENS and from 0.92 
(walking) to 0.99 (sedentary) for ActiPASS across all activity types.
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that two available no-code classification methods 
can be used to accurately identify basic physical activity types and postures. 
Our results highlight the accuracy of both methods based on relatively low 
sampling frequency data. The classification methods showed differences in 
performance, with lower sensitivity observed in free-living cycling (SENS) and 
slow treadmill walking (ActiPASS). Both methods use different sets of activity 
classes with varying definitions, which may explain the observed differences. 
Our results support the use of the SENS motion system and both no-code 
classification methods.

INTRODUCTION: Locomotion activities are part of most human daily tasks and are 
the basis for subsistence activities, particularly for hunter-gatherers. 
Therefore, differences in speed walking-related variables may have an effect, 
not only on the mobility of the group, but also on its composition. Some 
anthropometric parameters related to body length could affect walking 
speed-related variables and contribute to different human behaviors. However, 
there is currently little information on the influence of these parameters in 
nonadult individuals.
METHODS: Overall, 11 females and 17 male child/adolescents, 8-17 years of age, 
volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. Five different pace 
walking tests were performed on a treadmill to calculate the optimal locomotion 
speed (OLS) and U-shaped relationship between the walking energy expenditure and 
speed (χ2 cost of transport [CoT]) (i.e., energetic walking flexibility).
RESULTS: The mean OLS was 3.05 ± 0.13 miles per hour (mph), with no differences 
between sexes. Similarly, there were no sex differences in walking flexibility 
according to the χ2 CoT. Body height (p < .0001) and femur length (p < .001) 
were positively correlated with χ2 CoT; however, female child/adolescents 
mitigated the effect of height and femur length when walking at suboptimal 
speeds.
CONCLUSION: Consistent with prior observations in adults, our findings suggest 
that anthropometric parameters related to body stature are associated with 
reduced suboptimal walking flexibility in children and adolescents. Taken 
together, these results suggest that children and adolescents can adapt their 
pace to the one of taller individuals without a highly energetic penalty, but 
this flexibility decreases with increasing body size.

Gait cycle variability during steady walking, described by the stride interval 
time series, has been used as a gait-stability-related measure. In particular, 
the positive persistency in the stride intervals with 1/f-like fluctuation and 
reduction of the persistency are the well-documented metrics that can 
characterize gait patterns of healthy young adults and elderly including 
patients with neurological diseases, respectively. Here, we examined effects of 
a dual task on gait cycle variability in healthy young adults, based on the mean 
and standard deviation statistics as well as the positive persistency of the 
stride intervals during steady walking on a treadmill. Specifically, three gait 
conditions were examined: control condition, non-cognitive task with holding a 
smartphone in front of the chest using their dominant hand and looking fixedly 
at a blank screen of the smartphone, and cognitive motor task with holding a 
smartphone as in the non-cognitive task and playing a puzzle game displayed on 
the smartphone by one-thumb operation. We showed that only the positive 
persistency, not the mean and standard deviation statistics, was affected by the 
cognitive and motor load of smartphone usage in the cognitive condition. More 
specifically, the positive persistency exhibited in the control and the 
non-cognitive conditions was significantly reduced in the cognitive condition. 
Our results suggest that the decrease in the positive persistency during the 
cognitive task, which might represent the deterioration of healthy gait pattern, 
is caused endogenously by the cognitive and motor load, not necessarily by the 
reduction of visual field as often hypothesized.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects movement and cognition, and 
physiotherapy, particularly treadmill gait training, has potential in addressing 
movement dysfunctions in PD. However, treadmill training falls short in 
addressing cognitive aspects and adherence. Virtual reality (VR) and 
gamification can enhance motor and cognitive retraining and improve adherence. 
People with Parkinson's Disease (PWPD) have decreased motor skill learning 
efficiency, but tDCS can improve motor and cognitive learning.
METHODS: 78 participants with PD will be randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
one of three groups: (1) treadmill + Gamified Virtual Reality Environment (GVRE) 
+ tDCS training group; (2) treadmill + GVRE training group or (3) treadmill 
training group. Participants will follow a 6-week, 12-session treadmill gait 
training plan, gradually increasing session duration from 20 to 45 minutes. 
Participants in (1) and (2) will undergo a GVRE training protocol, with (1) also 
receiving tDCS for the first 20 minutes of each session. Assessments will occur 
at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 6-week follow-up. The primary outcome 
measure will be gait speed during single and dual-task performance. Secondary 
measures will include additional gait parameters, executive tests for cognitive 
performance, and clinical outcomes for disease stage, cognitive status, and 
physical condition.
DISCUSSION: This randomized clinical trial presents an innovative 
neurorehabilitation protocol that aims to improve gait and cognition in PWPD. 
The study also examines how tDCS can enhance motor and cognitive training. 
Results could contribute to enhancing the motor and cognitive state of PWPD 
through a GVRE and tDCS-based neurorehabilitation protocol.

leg prosthesis can improve step-to-step transition work and effective foot 
length ratio during walking in people with transtibial amputation.

People with unilateral transtibial amputation (TTA) using a passive-elastic 
prosthesis exhibit lower positive affected leg trailing work (ALtrail Wpos) and 
a greater magnitude of negative unaffected leg leading work (ULlead Wneg) during 
walking than non-amputees, which may increase joint pain and osteoarthritis risk 
in the unaffected leg. People with TTA using a stance-phase powered prosthesis 
(e.g., BiOM, Ottobock, Duderstadt, Germany) walk with increased ALtrail Wpos and 
potentially decreased magnitude of ULlead Wneg compared to a passive-elastic 
prosthesis. The BiOM includes a passive-elastic prosthesis with a 
manufacturer-recommended stiffness category and can be tuned to different power 
settings, which may change ALtrail Wpos, ULlead Wneg, and the prosthesis 
effective foot length ratio (EFLR). Thirteen people with TTA walked using 16 
different prosthetic stiffness category and power settings on a level treadmill 
at 0.75-1.75 m/s. We constructed linear mixed effects models to determine the 
effects of stiffness category and power settings on ALtrail Wpos, ULlead Wneg, 
and EFLR and hypothesized that decreased stiffness and increased power would 
increase ALtrail Wpos, not change and decrease ULlead Wneg magnitude, and 
decrease and not change prosthesis EFLR, respectively. We found there was no 
significant effect of stiffness category on ALtrail Wpos but increased stiffness 
reduced ULlead Wneg magnitude, perhaps due to a 0.02 increase in prosthesis EFLR 
compared to the least stiff category. Furthermore, we found that use of the BiOM 
with 10% and 20% greater than recommended power increased ALtrail Wpos and 
decreased ULlead Wneg magnitude at 0.75-1.00 m/s. However, prosthetic power 
setting depended on walking speed so that use of the BiOM increased ULlead Wneg 
magnitude at 1.50-1.75 m/s compared to a passive-elastic prosthesis. Ultimately, 
our results suggest that at 0.75-1.00 m/s, prosthetists should utilize the BiOM 
attached to a passive-elastic prosthesis with an increased stiffness category 
and power settings up to 20% greater than recommended based on biological ankle 
values. This prosthetic configuration can allow people with unilateral 
transtibial amputation to increase ALtrail Wpos and minimize ULlead Wneg 
magnitude, which could reduce joint pain and osteoarthritis risk in the 
unaffected leg and potentially lower the metabolic cost of walking.

BACKGROUND: Falls due to stumbling are prevalent for transfemoral prosthesis 
users and may lead to increased injury risk. This preliminary case series 
analyzes the transfemoral prosthesis user stumble recovery response to highlight 
key deficits in current commercially-available prostheses and proposes potential 
interventions to improve recovery outcomes.
METHODS: Six transfemoral prosthesis users were perturbed on their prosthetic 
limb at least three times while walking on a treadmill using obstacle 
perturbations in early, mid and late swing. Kinematic data were collected to 
characterize the response, while fall rate and key kinematic recovery metrics 
were used to assess the quality of recovery and highlight functional deficits in 
current commercially-available prostheses.
RESULTS: Across all participants, 13 (54%) of the 24 trials resulted in a fall 
(defined as > 50% body-weight support) with all but one participant (83%) 
falling at least once and two participants (33%) falling every time. In 
contrast, in a previous study of seven young, unimpaired, non-prosthesis users 
using the same experimental apparatus, no falls occurred across 190 trials. For 
the transfemoral prosthesis users, early swing had the highest rate of falling 
at 64%, followed by mid-swing at 57%, and then late swing at 33%. The trend in 
falls was mirrored by the kinematic recovery metrics (peak trunk angle, peak 
trunk angular velocity, forward reach of the perturbed limb, and knee angle at 
ground contact). In early swing all four metrics were deficient compared to 
non-prosthesis user controls. In mid swing, all but trunk angular velocity were 
deficient. In late swing only forward reach was deficient.
CONCLUSION: Based on the stumble recovery responses, four potential deficiencies 
were identified in the response of the knee prostheses: (1) insufficient 
resistance to stance knee flexion upon ground contact; (2) insufficient swing 
extension after a perturbation; (3) difficulty initiating swing flexion 
following a perturbation; and (4) excessive impedance against swing flexion in 
early swing preventing the potential utilization of the elevating strategy. Each 
of these issues can potentially be addressed by mechanical or mechatronic 
changes to prosthetic design to improve quality of recovery and reduce the 
likelihood a fall.

This study aimed to verify the effect of 12 weeks of HIIT on the perceived sleep 
quality and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA). For this, a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial, 
including 36 adults with moderate-severe OSA (19 males; 52.2 ± 9.8 years; body 
mass index = 34.2 ± 5.8; AHI = 42.0 ± 22.9 e/h) was performed. Participants were 
randomly assigned to HIIT [5 periods of 4 min of walking or running on a 
treadmill at 90-95 % of maximum heart rate (HRmax) interspersed with 3 min of 
walking at 50-55 % of HRmax performed three times per week for 12 weeks] or a 
control group (CG; stretching exercises performed two times per week for 12 
weeks). Specific domains of subjective sleep quality and EDS were assessed at 
baseline and post 12 weeks. Generalized estimated equation were used to verify 
between groups and times differences. There were no group × time interactions 
for the domains sleep duration (0.416), sleep efficiency (0.198), sleep 
disturbance (0.523), and sleep medications (0.915). However, significant 
group × time interactions were observed for global sleep score (0.022), and for 
the domains sleep quality (0.001), sleep latency (0.029), and daytime 
dysfunction (0.012). In addition, there was a significant group × time 
interaction for EDS (HIIT = -3.4 ± 0.9; CG change = -1.0 ± 1.0; p = 0.023). 
Thus, in patients with OSA, 12 weeks of HIIT improves perceived sleep quality 
and daytime sleepiness.

OBJECTIVE: This study explored the impact of one session of low-pressure leg 
blood flow restriction (BFR) during treadmill walking on dual-task performance 
in older adults using the neurovisceral integration model framework.
METHODS: Twenty-seven older adults participated in 20-min treadmill sessions, 
either with BFR (100 mmHg cuff pressure on both thighs) or without it (NBFR). 
Dual-task performance, measured through light-pod tapping while standing on 
foam, and heart rate variability during treadmill walking were compared.
RESULTS: Following BFR treadmill walking, the reaction time (p = 0.002) and sway 
area (p = 0.012) of the posture dual-task were significantly reduced. 
Participants exhibited a lower mean heart rate (p < 0.001) and higher heart rate 
variability (p = 0.038) during BFR treadmill walking. Notably, BFR also led to 
band-specific reductions in regional brain activities (theta, alpha, and beta 
bands, p < 0.05). The topology of the EEG network in the theta and alpha bands 
became more star-like in the post-test after BFR treadmill walking (p < 0.005).
CONCLUSION: BFR treadmill walking improves dual-task performance in older adults 
via vagally-mediated network integration with superior neural economy. This 
approach has the potential to prevent age-related falls by promoting cognitive 
reserves.

PURPOSE: To compare arm-ergometry and treadmill supervised exercise training on 
cardiorespiratory fitness and walking distances in patients with peripheral 
artery disease (PAD).
METHODS: ARMEX was a single-center, single-blinded, parallel group, 
non-inferiority trial enrolling symptomatic patients with PAD. Patients were 
randomized (1:1 ratio) to a 12-wk arm-ergometry (AEx) or standard treadmill 
(TEx) supervised exercise training protocol. The powered primary end point was 
the change in peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 ) at 12 wk, measured on a treadmill 
cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX). Secondary outcomes included changes in VO 2 
at the first ventilatory threshold (VT-1), ventilatory efficiency (ratio of 
minute ventilation [VE] to carbon dioxide production [VCO 2 ], VE/VCO 2 ), 
walking distances by CPX and 6-min walking test (6MWT), and self-reported 
walking limitations.
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (66 ± 8 yr; 88% male) were randomized (AEx, n = 28; 
TEx, n = 28). At 12 wk, VO 2peak change was not significantly different between 
groups (0.75 mL/kg/min; 95% CI, -0.94 to 2.44; P = .378), despite a significant 
increase only in AEx. VO 2 at VT-1 improved in both groups without between-group 
differences, and VE/VCO 2 slope improved more in AEx. The TEx attained greater 
improvements in walking distance by CPX (121.08 m; 95% CI, 24.49-217.66; P 
= .015) and 6MWT (25.08 m; 95% CI, 5.87-44.29; P = .012) and self-perceived 
walking distance.
CONCLUSIONS: Arm-ergometry was noninferior to standard treadmill training for VO 
2peak , and treadmill training was associated with greater improvements in 
walking distance. Our data support the use of treadmill as a first-line choice 
in patients with PAD to enhance walking capacity, but arm-ergometry could be an 
option in selected patients.

BACKGROUND: Impairments in unilateral ankle propulsion may result from 
restriction by an external device or pathology such as lower limb amputation. 
Models of gait suggest this reduction may lead to increased collisional force on 
the contralateral side, potentially increasing force through the knee and 
increasing the risk of knee pain or osteoarthritis.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How do restrictions in unilateral ankle propulsive force 
affect contralateral knee joint loading in otherwise healthy individuals?
METHODS: 18 individuals without impairment walked on a treadmill at 1.5 m/s for 
two conditions: one free of restrictions, and one where a randomized limb's 
ankle propulsive force was restricted using an off-the-shelf ankle-foot orthosis 
(AFO). Ankle propulsive power, lower extremity joint work, and ground reaction 
force variables were calculated for the final 3 gait cycles of each condition. 
Tibiofemoral joint contact force (TJCF) for the limb contralateral to the AFO 
was calculated through a standard OpenSim workflow utilizing the gait2392 model. 
Intra-limb pair-wise comparisons were made between conditions.
RESULTS: Compared to walking unrestricted, the limb wearing the AFO demonstrated 
a significant reduction in peak ankle propulsive power and positive ankle work 
by approximately 50 % each (p<0.01). With ankle restriction, the ipsilateral 
knee significantly increased positive work (p<0.01). The overall propulsion 
produced by that limb did not change between conditions, demonstrated by a lack 
of change in anterior ground reaction force impulse (p=0.11). The knee of the 
limb contralateral to the AFO did not display differences in any TJCF variable 
between conditions (all p>0.07).
SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest a unilateral deficit in ankle propulsion 
will not increase contralateral knee joint forces in individuals who are able to 
use other joints of the limb to compensate for the loss of ankle function. 
However, further research should investigate this relationship in those who 
display pathologies that may prevent more proximal compensations.

Falls in older individuals often result from unexpected balance disturbances 
during walking, necessitating the analysis of recovery strategies for effective 
falls prevention. This becomes particularly crucial for individuals with 
cognitive impairment, who face a higher fall risk compared to cognitively 
healthy adults. Hence, our study aimed to compare the recovery response to 
standardized walking perturbations on a treadmill between older adults with 
cognitive impairment and cognitively healthy older adults. 36 individuals with a 
recent history of a severe fall, leading to an emergency department visit 
without subsequent admission, were stratified into two groups (with and without 
probable cognitive impairment) based on scores of the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment. Recovery performance was quantified using force plate data from a 
perturbation treadmill (M-Gait, Motek Medical B.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands), 
specifically evaluating the number of steps needed to restore step length and 
width to pre perturbation baseline across two trials of nine different 
perturbations. Individuals with cognitive impairment (n = 18, mean age: 74.7) 
required significantly (p = 0.045, Cohen's d = 0.69) more steps to recover total 
steps after perturbations compared to cognitively healthy individuals (n = 18, 
mean age: 69.7). While step width recovery was similar between the groups, those 
with probable cognitive impairment required significantly more steps to recover 
their step length (p = 0.039, Cohen's d = 0.72). Thus, our findings indicate 
that older adults with probable cognitive impairment manifest inferior gait 
adaptability, especially in adapting step length, potentially underscoring a 
critical aspect for effective falls prevention in this population.

Practicing complex locomotor skills, such as those involving a step sequence 
engages distinct perceptual and motor mechanisms that support the recall of 
learning under new conditions (i.e., skill transfer). While sleep has been shown 
to enhance learning of sequences of fine movements (i.e., sleep-dependent 
consolidation), here we examined whether this benefit extends to learning of a 
locomotor pattern. Specifically, we tested the perceptual and motor learning of 
a locomotor sequence following sleep compared to wake. We hypothesized that 
post-practice sleep would increase locomotor sequence learning in the 
perceptual, but not in the motor domain. In this study, healthy young adult 
participants (n = 48; 18-33 years) practiced a step length sequence on a 
treadmill cued by visual stimuli displayed on a screen during training. 
Participants were then tested in a perceptual condition (backward walking with 
the same visual stimuli), or a motor condition (forward walking but with an 
inverted screen). Skill was assessed immediately, and again after a 12-h delay 
following overnight sleep or daytime wake (n = 12 for each interval/condition). 
Off-line learning improved following sleep compared to wake, but only for the 
perceptual condition. Our results suggest that perceptual and motor sequence 
learning are processed separately after locomotor training, and further points 
to a benefit of sleep that is rooted in the perceptual as opposed to the motor 
aspects of motor learning.

This study presents an analysis and evaluation of gait asymmetry (GA) based on 
the temporal gait parameters identified using a portable gait event detection 
system, placed on the lateral side of the shank of both lower extremities of the 
participants. Assessment of GA was carried out with seven control subjects (CS), 
one transfemoral amputee (TFA) and one transtibial amputee (TTA) while walking 
at different speeds on overground (OG) and treadmill (TM). Gait cycle duration 
(GCD), stance phase duration (SPD), swing phase duration (SwPD), and the 
sub-phases of the gait cycle (GC) such as Loading-Response (LR), Foot-Flat (FF), 
and Push-Off (PO), Swing-1 (SW-1) and Swing-2 (SW-2) were evaluated. The results 
revealed that GCD showed less asymmetry as compared to other temporal parameters 
in both groups. A significant difference (p < 0.05) was observed between the 
groups for SPD and SwPD with lower limb amputees (LLA) having a longer stance 
and shorter swing phase for their intact side compared to their amputated side, 
resulting, large GA for TFA compared to CS and TTA. The findings could 
potentially contribute towards a better understanding of gait characteristics in 
LLA and provide a guide in the design and control of lower limb 
prosthetics/orthotics.

This study aimed to assess and compare changes in body composition, standing 
balance, cardiovascular parameters, and salivary biomarkers, particularly 
salivary antioxidant status, after brisk walking training with or without music 
in older women. Twenty-four subjects were randomly assigned to brisk walking 
groups: with music (BWM) (n=12) or without music (BW) (n=12). Eighteen subjects 
completed the exercise training (9 in each group), and their data were used for 
analysis. The research protocols were classified into three phases: pretraining 
phase, training phase, and posttraining phase, while the data collection was 
divided into four sessions: resting condition, during treadmill exercise 
testing, immediately posttreadmill exercise testing, and 5-min posttreadmill 
exercise testing defined as after the cool-down session. The results showed that 
8 weeks of home-based brisk walking with or without music did not improve 
standing balance, blood pressure, salivary biomarkers including total protein 
concentration, and antioxidant status but maintained or prevented the decline of 
these parameters. Only the BWM group reduced fat mass relative to increasing 
fat-free mass (P<0.05) and improved recovery heart rate (P<0.05) by modifying 
cardiac autonomic control in posttreadmill exercise testing. Therefore, brisk 
walking with preferred music can be a tool to delay the progression of 
cardiovascular dysfunction in older women. A longer duration of the exercise 
program and larger groups of participants are needed for further investigation 
of brisk walking with or without music on physiological and biochemical changes.

The adaptive control of walking is often studied on a split-belt treadmill, 
where people gradually reduce their step length asymmetries (SLAs) by modulating 
foot placement and timing. Although it is proposed that this adaptation may be 
driven in part by a desire to reduce instability, it is unknown if changes in 
asymmetry impact people's ability to maintain balance in response to 
destabilizing perturbations. Here, we used intermittent perturbations to 
determine if changes in SLA affect reactive balance control as measured by 
whole-body angular momentum (WBAM) in the sagittal and frontal planes. Sixteen 
neurotypical older adults (70.0 ± 5.3 years old; 6 males) walked on a treadmill 
at a 2:1 belt speed ratio with real-time visual feedback of their achieved and 
target step lengths. We used mixed-effects models to determine if there were 
associations between SLA or foot placement and WBAM during the applied 
perturbations. Walking with more positive SLAs was associated with small 
reductions in forward WBAM (p < 0.001 for fast and slow belts) but increased 
lateral WBAM (p = 0.045 for fast belt; p = 0.003 for slow belt) during 
perturbations. When participants walked with more positive SLAs, they shortened 
their foot placement on the slow belt, and this shortening was associated with 
moderate reductions in forward WBAM (p < 0.001) and small increases in lateral 
WBAM (p = 0.008) during slow-belt perturbations. Our findings suggest that 
spatiotemporal changes that occur during split-belt treadmill walking may 
improve sagittal-plane stability by reducing people's susceptibility to losses 
of balance, but this may come at the expense of frontal-plane stability.

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to evaluate the effects of aerobic exercise applied 
with bodyweight-supported treadmill (BWSTT) or cycle ergometer (CE) in 
Parkinson's patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the prospective single-blind study, 38 Parkinson's 
patients with Hoehn-Yahr Stage 1-3 were randomized into the CE and BWSTT groups 
between May 2019 and March 2020. Evaluations before and after six weeks of 
treatment included a six-min walking test with a software device as the primary 
outcome and functional balance tests (Tinetti balance and gait test, one-leg 
stance balance test) as secondary outcomes. Both groups received 40 min of 
aerobic exercise three days per week with conventional rehabilitation and 
various methods. CE and BWSTT groups were created. The aerobic exercise program 
was designed based on treatment recommendations for Parkinson's patients of the 
American College of Sports Medicine (CE test, with the Karvonen formula, 40-60% 
reserve). Posttreatment and pretreatment evaluations were compared within and 
between groups.
RESULTS: The six-week aerobic exercise program was completed by 16 participants 
(9 males, 7 females; mean age: 65.9±8.1; range, 47 to 78 years) in the CE group 
and 15 participants (9 males, 6 females; mean age: 62.5±7.5; range, 49 to 79 
years) in the BWSTT group. The demographic characteristics of the patients were 
similar. Primary and secondary outcomes were significantly different after 
treatment than before treatment in both groups. There were no significant 
differences between the groups in outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that both methods are effective and not superior 
to each other. Aerobic exercise programs led by experienced clinicians can 
benefit patients.

Oleuropein aglycone (OA), which is the absorbed form of oleuropein, is a major 
phenolic compound in extra virgin olive oil. We analyzed the anti-obesity effect 
of OA intake combined with mild treadmill walking (MTW, 4 m/min for 20 min/d, 
5-6 d/wk, without electric shocks and slope) in rats under a high-fat diet (HF). 
Four-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=28) were equally divided into four 
groups: control (HF), 0.08% oleuropein-supplemented HF (HFO), HF with MTW 
(HF+W), and HFO with MTW (HFO+W) groups. After 28 d, the inguinal subcutaneous 
fat content and weight gain were significantly lower in the HFO+W group than in 
the control group. The HFO+W group also had significantly higher levels of 
urinary noradrenaline secretion, interscapular brown adipose tissue, uncoupling 
protein 1, brain transient receptor potential ankyrin subtype 1 (TRPA1), 
vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) than 
the control group. Especially, the HFO+W group showed a synergistic effect on 
noradrenaline secretion. Therefore, OA combined with MTW may accelerate the 
enhancement of UCP1 and BDNF levels in rats with HF-induced obesity by 
increasing noradrenaline secretion after TRPA1 and TRPV1 activation.

Differences in running gait between treadmill and overground running has been 
subject of study, while consistency of group differences between running 
surfaces has not been previously analysed. This study examined both the 
differences between running surfaces and the consistency of sex-based 
differences between surfaces in some spatiotemporal and kinematic variables 
measured by an inertial measurement unit fastened over the lumbar spine. 
Thirty-two (sixteen females) endurance runners firstly performed overground and 
then treadmill (1 % inclination) runs at speeds between 9-21 km∙h-1. Males 
showed lower flight time (FT) [moderate effect size (ES)] during treadmill 
running compared to overground, while females showed greater stride frequency 
(SF) (moderate ES), lower stride length (SL) (moderate ES), FT (moderate ES), 
and vertical (VT) trunk displacement (moderate ES), as well as greater 
medio-lateral (ML) trunk displacement (moderate ES). No differences in CT 
between surfaces were found (trivial to small). Furthermore, all the 
sex-differences were consistent between treadmill and overground running: Males 
showed lower SF (large and moderate ES, respectively), greater SL (large and 
moderate ES) and CT (moderate and large ES), lower FT (large ES), greater VT 
displacement (moderate to large ES), and lower ML displacement (moderate ES) 
than females. These results may be of interest to carefully transfer the running 
gait analyses between surfaces depending on sex.

Exploring the Influence of Structured Familiarization to an Adjustable, Passive 
Load-Bearing Exoskeleton on Oxygen Consumption and Lower Limb Muscle Activation 
During Walking.

Diamond-Ouellette G, Le Quang M, Karakolis T, Bouyer LJ, Best KL.

Walking patterns are modified during load carriage, resulting in an increased 
activation of lower limb muscles and energy expenditure. Negative effects of 
load carriage could be minimized by wearing an exoskeleton, but evidence on the 
effects are conflicting. The objectives of this study were to describe the 
influence of an adjustable, passive load-bearing exoskeleton on the metabolic 
cost of walking (MCW) and associated muscle activations, and to explore changes 
in MCW after a familiarization process. Thirteen participants walked on a 
treadmill with a 22.75 kg payload at six preselected speeds (from 0.67 to 1.56 
m/s) under three walking conditions: 1) without exoskeleton (NoExo); 2) with 
exoskeleton before familiarization (ExoPre); and 3) with exoskeleton after 
familiarization (ExoPost). Metabolic data was normalized to walking speed to 
provide MCW. Multi-muscle surface electromyography (EMG) was time and amplitude 
normalized to the gait cycle to provide muscle activation patterns. The 
familiarization occurred over three weeks including exposure to the exoskeleton. 
Differences in MCW and muscle activations were compared using a nonparametric 
analysis of longitudinal data. There were statistically significant increases in 
MCW for all speeds in the ExoPre and ExoPost conditions compared the NoExo. The 
average muscle activation showed an increase during ExoPre and ExoPost for the 
three speeds evaluated. Post-hoc analysis showed no significant effect of the 
familiarization period on metabolic data. In conclusion, a first exposure to the 
adjustable exoskeleton increased MCW and muscle activations, but the 
familiarization process did not provide any benefits toward a reduction in MCW 
or reduction in muscle activations at all speeds evaluated.

The investigation of gait and its neuronal correlates under more ecologically 
valid conditions as well as real-time feedback visualization is becoming 
increasingly important in neuro-motor rehabilitation research. The Gait 
Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab (GRAIL) offers advanced opportunities for 
gait and gait-related research by creating more naturalistic yet controlled 
environments through immersive virtual reality. Investigating the neuronal 
aspects of gait requires parallel recording of brain activity, such as through 
mobile electroencephalography (EEG) and/or mobile functional near-infrared 
spectroscopy (fNIRS), which must be synchronized with the kinetic and /or 
kinematic data recorded while walking. This proof-of-concept study outlines the 
required setup by use of the lab streaming layer (LSL) ecosystem for real-time, 
simultaneous data collection of two independently operating multi-channel EEG 
and fNIRS measurement devices and gait kinetics. In this context, a customized 
approach using a photodiode to synchronize the systems is described. This study 
demonstrates the achievable temporal accuracy of synchronous data acquisition of 
neurophysiological and kinematic and kinetic data collection in the GRAIL. By 
using event-related cerebral hemodynamic activity and visually evoked potentials 
during a start-to-go task and a checkerboard test, we were able to confirm that 
our measurement system can replicate known physiological phenomena with 
latencies in the millisecond range and relate neurophysiological and kinetic 
data to each other with sufficient accuracy.

BACKGROUND: Treadmill gait training has been shown to improve gait performance 
in People with Parkinson's Disease (PwPD), and in combination with Virtual 
Reality, it can be an effective tool for gait rehabilitation. The addition of 
gamification elements can create a more stimulating and adherent intervention. 
However, implementation of new technologies in healthcare can be challenging. 
This study aimed to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a treadmill 
rehabilitation program in a Gamified Virtual Reality Environment (GVRE) for 
PwPD.
METHODS: The GVRE was developed following a user-centered design approach, 
involving both PwPD and physiotherapists in the development and evaluation of 
the intervention. The intervention consisted of a walking simulation in three 
different environments (countryside, city, and park), which had a progressive 
increase in difficulty. To test its feasibility, three sessions were carried out 
with four PwPD and four physiotherapists. To assess the usability, the System 
Usability Scale (SUS), Assistive Technology Usability Questionnaire for people 
with Neurological diseases (NATU Quest) and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire 
(SSQ) were used. To assess the intervention's acceptability, feedback and 
in-game performance was collected from participants.
RESULTS: Results showed the feasibility of the intervention, with a SUS score of 
74.82 ± 12.62, and a NATU Quest score of 4.49 ± 0.62, and positive acceptability 
feedback. Participants showed clear preferences for naturalistic environments, 
and gamification elements were seen as positive. Difficulty settings worked as 
intended, but lowered enjoyment of the experience in some cases.
CONCLUSIONS: This intervention was successfully shown as a feasible option for 
the training of gait under Dual Task conditions for PwPD. It offers a safe and 
replicable environment in which complex situations can be trained. However, 
further iterations of the intervention need to be improved in order to guarantee 
accurate tracking and a more realistic training progression.

Visuospatial Skills Explain Differences in the Ability to Use Propulsion 
Biofeedback Post-stroke.

California, Los Angeles, California (S.A.K., J.M.F., K.A.L.); Neuroscience 
Graduate Program, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 
(J.M.F., K.A.L.); and Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of 
Southern California, Los Angeles, California (J.M.F.).

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Visual biofeedback can be used to help people 
post-stroke reduce biomechanical gait impairments. Using visual biofeedback 
engages an explicit, cognitively demanding motor learning process. Participants 
with better overall cognitive function are better able to use visual biofeedback 
to promote locomotor learning; however, which specific cognitive domains are 
responsible for this effect are unknown. We aimed to understand which cognitive 
domains were associated with performance during acquisition and immediate 
retention when using visual biofeedback to increase paretic propulsion in 
individuals post-stroke.
METHODS: Participants post-stroke completed cognitive testing, which provided 
scores for different cognitive domains, including executive function, immediate 
memory, visuospatial/constructional skills, language, attention, and delayed 
memory. Next, participants completed a single session of paretic propulsion 
biofeedback training, where we collected treadmill-walking data for 20 min with 
biofeedback and 2 min without biofeedback. We fit separate regression models to 
determine if cognitive domain scores, motor impairment (measured with the 
lower-extremity Fugl-Meyer), and gait speed could explain propulsion error and 
variability during biofeedback use and recall error during immediate retention.
RESULTS: Visuospatial/constructional skills and motor impairment best-explained 
propulsion error during biofeedback use (adjusted R 2  = 0.56, P = 0.0008), and 
attention best-explained performance variability (adjusted R 2  = 0.17, P 
= 0.048). Language skills best-explained recall error during immediate retention 
(adjusted R 2  = 0.37, P = 0.02).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that specific cognitive 
domain impairments explain variability in locomotor learning outcomes in 
individuals with chronic stroke. This suggests that with further investigation, 
specific cognitive impairment information may be useful to predict 
responsiveness to interventions and personalize training parameters to 
facilitate locomotor learning.

Adults with intellectual disabilities experience numerous health inequalities. 
Targeting unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, such as high levels of sedentary 
behaviour and overweight/obesity, is a priority area for improving the health 
and adults with intellectual disabilities and reducing inequalities. Energy 
expenditure is a fundamental component of numerous health behaviours and an 
essential component of various free-living behaviour measurements, e.g. 
accelerometry. However, little is known about energy expenditure in adults with 
intellectual disabilities and no population-specific accelerometer data 
interpretation methods have been calibrated. The limited research in this area 
suggests that adults with intellectual disabilities have a higher energy 
expenditure, which requires further exploration, and could have significant 
impacts of device calibration. However, due to the complex methods required for 
measuring energy expenditure, it is essential to first evaluate feasibility and 
develop an effective protocol. This study aims to test the feasibility of a 
laboratory-based protocol to enable the measurement of energy expenditure and 
accelerometer calibration in adults with intellectual disabilities.We aimed to 
recruit ten adults (≥ 18 years) with intellectual disabilities. The protocol 
involved a total of nine sedentary, stationary, and physical activities, e.g. 
sitting, lying down, standing, and treadmill walking. Each activity was for 5 
min, with one 10 min lying down activity to measure resting energy expenditure. 
Breath by breath respiratory gas exchange and accelerometry (ActiGraph and 
ActivPAL) were measured during each activity. Feasibility was assessed 
descriptively using recruitment and outcome measurement completion rates, and 
participant/stakeholder feedback.Ten adults (N = 7 female) with intellectual 
disabilities participated in this study. The recruitment rate was 50% and 90% 
completed the protocol and all outcome measures. Therefore, the recruitment 
strategy and protocol are feasible.This study addresses a significant gap in our 
knowledge relating to exercise laboratory-based research for adults with 
intellectual disabilities The findings from this study provide essential data 
that can be used to inform the development of future protocols to measure energy 
expenditure and for accelerometer calibration in adults with intellectual 
disabilities.

The ankle dorsiflexion kinetics demand to increase swing phase foot-ground 
clearance: implications for assistive device design and energy demands.

BACKGROUND: The ankle is usually highly effective in modulating the swing foot's 
trajectory to ensure safe ground clearance but there are few reports of ankle 
kinetics and mechanical energy exchange during the gait cycle swing phase. 
Previous work has investigated ankle swing mechanics during normal walking but 
with developments in devices providing dorsiflexion assistance, it is now 
essential to understand the minimal kinetic requirements for increasing ankle 
dorsiflexion, particularly for devices employing energy harvesting or utilizing 
lighter and lower power energy sources or actuators.
METHODS: Using a real-time treadmill-walking biofeedback technique, swing phase 
ankle dorsiflexion was experimentally controlled to increase foot-ground 
clearance by 4 cm achieved via increased ankle dorsiflexion. Swing phase ankle 
moments and dorsiflexor muscle forces were estimated using AnyBody modeling 
system. It was hypothesized that increasing foot-ground clearance by 4 cm, 
employing only the ankle joint, would require significantly higher dorsiflexion 
moments and muscle forces than a normal walking control condition.
RESULTS: Results did not confirm significantly increased ankle moments with 
augmented dorsiflexion, with 0.02 N.m/kg at toe-off reducing to zero by the end 
of swing. Tibialis Anterior muscle force incremented significantly from 2 to 
4 N/kg after toe-off, due to coactivation with the Soleus. To ensure an 
additional 4 cm mid swing foot-ground clearance, an estimated additional 0.003 
Joules/kg is required to be released immediately after toe-off.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the interplay between ankle moments, muscle 
forces, and energy demands during swing phase ankle dorsiflexion, offering 
insights for the design of ankle assistive technologies. External devices do not 
need to deliver significantly greater ankle moments to increase ankle 
dorsiflexion but, they should offer higher mechanical power to provide rapid 
bursts of energy to facilitate quick dorsiflexion transitions before reaching 
Minimum Foot Clearance event. Additionally, for ankle-related bio-inspired 
devices incorporating artificial muscles or humanoid robots that aim to 
replicate natural ankle biomechanics, the inclusion of supplementary Tibialis 
Anterior forces is crucial due to Tibialis Anterior and Soleus co-activation. 
These design strategies ensures that ankle assistive technologies are both 
effective and aligned with the biomechanical realities of human movement.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is an understudied condition among runners, and 
it is unclear what biomechanical features could be targeted for gait retraining 
to mitigate pain.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How do running biomechanics differ between healthy 
individuals and those with running-related LBP?
METHODS: This was a case-controlled, comparative study design of community 
runners: running-related LBP (n=52) and healthy controls (n=52). All runners 
completed running history forms and performed a 3-dimensional gait analysis. 
Kinematic data were collected using a motion capture system and normalized to a 
gait cycle, while participants ran on a level grade at self-selected speed on an 
instrumented treadmill. Current running volume, temporal-spatial, kinetic and 
kinematic features were compared between groups.
RESULTS: The LBP group had 39.5 % lower weekly distance and 15.4 % fewer were 
currently training for a race (all p<.05). Runners with LBP demonstrated lower 
cadence (166±10 step/min vs. 171±9 step/min; p=.05), greater center of gravity 
lateral displacement (1.4±0.5 cm vs. 1.2 ±.3 cm; p=.044) and greater stride 
width variability (1.3±0.4 cm versus 1.0 ± 0.04 cm; p=.008). Runners with LBP 
had a greater Vertical Average Loading Rate ([VALR] 67.7±22.2 bodyweights [BW]/s 
vs. 62.2±21.5 BW/s; p=.022), and higher joint moments (N*m/(kg*m)) at the knee 
in the sagittal plane (2.13±0.50 vs. 1.87±0.56; p <.001), frontal plane 
(1.44±0.39 vs. 1.29±0.29; p=.013), and at the hip in the frontal plane 
(2.04±0.51 vs. 1.84±0.41; p=.024). No differences were found between groups in 
the pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle joint excursions in any plane of motion during 
a typical gait cycle.
SIGNIFICANCE: These collective motion signature may reflect challenges with 
control of motion and VALR in the presence of back pain. Cadence training to 
increase step rate, coupled with core/hip muscle activation, may be an important 
strategy to reduce motion variability, impact loading rate and pain symptoms 
while running.

With increased age, walking without tripping requires greater cognitive demand. 
Therefore, it may be beneficial for training interventions to address and 
incorporate aspects of cognitive load. The purpose of this study was to compare 
a semi-immersive virtual reality treadmill training (VRTT) and conventional 
treadmill training (CTT) on obstacle clearance and trip hazard in older adults. 
Obstacle clearance parameters were measured with foot-mounted inertial 
measurement units (IMUs) and a Zeno pressure walkway. All data were processed 
and analyzed through custom Matlab scripts. Obstacle step height mean decreased 
(p = .003) in the lead limb following both training interventions. Additional 
significant changes were found in pre- and post-obstacle distance mean following 
both training interventions. Furthermore, significant correlations were found 
between demographic, cognitive, and functional mobility assessments and changes 
in dependent measures. The findings suggest that both the VRTT and CTT 
interventions may provide a reduction in trip risk in older adults, although 
through different methods.

An easy-to-use and reliable tool is essential for gait assessment of people with 
gait pathologies. This study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of the 
OneStep smartphone application compared to the C-Mill-VR+ treadmill (Motek, 
Nederlands), among patients undergoing rehabilitation for unilateral lower 
extremity disability. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were extracted from the 
treadmill and from two smartphones, one on each leg. Inter-device reliability 
was evaluated using Pearson correlation, intra-cluster correlation coefficient 
(ICC), and Cohen's d, comparing the application's readings from the two phones. 
Validity was assessed by comparing readings from each phone to the treadmill. 
Twenty-eight patients completed the study; the median age was 45.5 years, and 
61% were males. The ICC between the phones showed a high correlation (r = 
0.89-1) and good-to-excellent reliability (ICC range, 0.77-1) for all the gait 
parameters examined. The correlations between the phones and the treadmill were 
mostly above 0.8. The ICC between each phone and the treadmill demonstrated 
moderate-to-excellent validity for all the gait parameters (range, 0.58-1). Only 
'step length of the impaired leg' showed poor-to-good validity (range, 
0.37-0.84). Cohen's d effect size was small (d < 0.5) for all the parameters. 
The studied application demonstrated good reliability and validity for 
spatiotemporal gait assessment in patients with unilateral lower limb 
disability.

The variability and regularity of stride time may help identify individuals at a 
greater risk of injury during military load carriage. Wearable sensors could 
provide a cost-effective, portable solution for recording these measures, but 
establishing their validity is necessary. This study aimed to determine the 
agreement of several measures of stride time variability across five wearable 
sensors (Opal APDM, Vicon Blue Trident, Axivity, Plantiga, Xsens DOT) and force 
plates during military load carriage. Nineteen Australian Army trainee soldiers 
(age: 24.8 ± 5.3 years, height: 1.77 ± 0.09 m, body mass: 79.5 ± 15.2 kg, 
service: 1.7 ± 1.7 years) completed three 12-min walking trials on an 
instrumented treadmill at 5.5 km/h, carrying 23 kg of an external load. 
Simultaneously, 512 stride time intervals were identified from 
treadmill-embedded force plates and each sensor where linear (standard deviation 
and coefficient of variation) and non-linear (detrended fluctuation analysis and 
sample entropy) measures were obtained. Sensor and force plate agreement was 
evaluated using Pearson's r and intraclass correlation coefficients. All sensors 
had at least moderate agreement (ICC > 0.5) and a strong positive correlation (r 
> 0.5). These results suggest wearable devices could be employed to quantify 
linear and non-linear measures of stride time variability during military load 
carriage.

Numerous studies have explored the biomechanics and energetics of human walking, 
offering valuable insights into how we walk. However, prior studies focused on 
changing external factors (e.g., walking speed) and examined group averages and 
trends rather than individual adaptations in the presence of internal 
constraints (e.g., injury-related muscle weakness). To address this gap, this 
paper presents an open dataset of human walking biomechanics and energetics 
collected from 21 neurotypical young adults. To investigate the effects of 
internal constraints (reduced joint range of motion), the participants are both 
the control group (free walking) and the intervention group (constrained walking 
- left knee fully extended using a passive orthosis). Each subject walked on a 
dual-belt treadmill at three speeds (0.4, 0.8, and 1.1 m/s) and five step 
frequencies ( - 10% to 20% of their preferred frequency) for a total of 30 test 
conditions. The dataset includes raw and segmented data featuring ground 
reaction forces, joint motion, muscle activity, and metabolic data. 
Additionally, a sample code is provided for basic data manipulation and 
visualisation.

BACKGROUND: Recent scientific evidence has challenged the traditional 
""rest-is-best"" approach for concussion management. It is now thought that 
""exercise-is-medicine"" for concussion, owing to dozens of studies which 
demonstrate that sub-maximal, graded aerobic exercise can reduce symptom burden 
and time to symptom resolution. However, the primary neuropathology of 
concussion is altered functional brain activity. To date, no studies have 
examined the effects of sub-maximal aerobic exercise on resting state functional 
brain activity in pediatric concussion. In addition, although exercise is now 
more widely prescribed following concussion, its cardiopulmonary response is not 
yet well understood in this population. Our study has two main goals. The first 
is to understand whether there are exercise-induced resting state functional 
brain activity differences in children with concussion vs. healthy controls. The 
second is to profile the physiological response to exercise and understand 
whether it differs between groups.
METHODS: We will perform a single-center, controlled, prospective cohort study 
of pediatric concussion at a large, urban children's hospital and academic 
center. Children with sport-related concussion (aged 12-17 years) will be 
recruited within 4-weeks of injury by our clinical study team members. Key 
inclusion criteria include: medical clearance to exercise, no prior concussion 
or neurological history, and no implants that would preclude MRI. Age- and 
sex-matched healthy controls will be required to meet the same inclusion 
criteria and will be recruited through the community. The study will be 
performed over two visits separated by 24-48 h. Visit 1 involves exercise 
testing (following the current clinical standard for concussion) and 
breath-by-breath gas collection using a metabolic cart. Visit 2 involves two 
functional MRI (fMRI) scans interspersed by 10-minutes of treadmill walking at 
an intensity calibrated to Visit 1 findings. To address sub-objectives, all 
participants will be asked to self-report symptoms daily and wear a waist-worn 
tri-axial accelerometer for 28-days after Visit 2.
DISCUSSION: Our study will advance the growing exercise-concussion field by 
helping us understand whether exercise impacts outcomes beyond symptoms in 
pediatric concussion. We will also be able to profile the cardiopulmonary 
response to exercise, which may allow for further understanding (and eventual 
optimization) of exercise in concussion management.

BACKGROUND: Tolerating physical tasks depends not only on task-specific 
characteristics but also on an individual's psychophysiological capacity to 
respond to the imposed load. People suffering from chronic low back pain (CLBP) 
may experience reduced psychophysiological capacity and are at risk for poor 
pain prognosis, which could lead to an increased walking workload.
AIM: To investigate how the risk of unfavorable pain prognosis in CLBP can 
impact walking physiomechanical parameters and psychophysiological workload.
METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study. The study classified 74 
volunteers into four groups based on their prognosis for pain: pain-free control 
(CG/n = 20), low (LrG/n = 21), medium (MrG/n = 22), and high (HrG/n = 11) risk 
of poor prognosis for CLBP. The ground assessments identified the self-selected 
(SSW) and optimal (OWS) walking speeds, as well as the locomotor rehabilitation 
index (LRI). Treadmill assessments were conducted at two different speeds (0.83 
and 1.11 m s-1, SSW and OWS) to record physiomechanical parameters. 
Psychophysiological workloads during walking were measured via workload impulse 
for the session (TRIMP), determined by variations in heart rate.
RESULTS: CLBP groups exhibited slower SSW and lower LRI compared to the CG. The 
TRIMP was lower in the LrG. However, both MrG and HrG exhibited a comparable 
overload to the CG, even while walking at a lower intensity with a 
psychophysical demand. SSW and OWS displayed an increased TRIMP compared to 
fixed speeds.
CONCLUSION: Psychosocial factors may affect SSW in people with CLBP but not 
among the risk strata. An unfavorable prognosis for pain could jeopardize the 
psychophysiological capacity to withstand walking demands.

Understanding how muscle activity changes with different surface grades during 
canter is essential for developing training protocols in Thoroughbreds because 
canter is their primary gait in training and races. We measured the 
spatiotemporal parameters and the activation of 12 surface muscles in the 
leading limb side of 7 Thoroughbreds. Horses were equipped with hoof strain 
gauges and cantered at 10 m/s on a treadmill set to grades of -4%, 0%, 4%, and 
8%, randomly, for 30 seconds each without a lead change. Integrated 
electromyography (iEMG) values during stance and swing phases were calculated 
and normalized to mean iEMG values during stride duration at 0% grade in each 
muscle. The iEMG values at each grade were compared using a generalized mixed 
model. Stride duration significantly decreased due to shorter swing duration on 
an 8% grade (P < 0.001) compared to all other grades, where no significant 
changes were observed. Compared to a 0% grade, the normalized iEMG values during 
the stance phase on an 8% grade in five muscles significantly increased 
(Musculus infraspinatus; +9%, M. longissimus dorsi (LD); +4%, M. gluteus medius 
(GM); +29%, M. biceps femoris; +47%, M. flexor digitorum lateralis; +16%). 
During the swing phase, the normalized iEMG values in six muscles significantly 
increased on an 8% grade compared to a 0% grade (M. splenius; +21%, M. triceps 
brachii; +54%, LD; +37%, GM; +24%, M. semitendinosus; +51%, M. extensor 
digitorum longus; +10%). No significant changes were observed in iEMG values on 
-4% and 4% grades compared to the 0% grade. Although +/- 4% grades had little 
effect on neuromuscular responses, 8% uphill canter reduced stride duration due 
to decreased swing duration and required increase of muscle activation during 
either stance and swing phase. Canter on an 8% grade might strengthen equine 
muscles to increase propulsive force and stride frequency.

Lower extremity injuries are prevalent in military trainees, especially in 
female and older trainees. Modifiable factors that lead to higher injury risk in 
these subgroups are not clear. The purpose of this study was to identify whether 
external loading variables during military-relevant tasks differ by age and sex 
in U.S. Army trainees. Data was collected on 915 trainees in the first week of 
Basic Combat Training. Participants performed running and ruck marching (walking 
with 18.1 kg pack) on a treadmill, as well as double-/single-leg drop landings. 
Variables included: vertical force loading rates, vertical stiffness, first peak 
vertical forces, peak vertical and resultant tibial accelerations. Comparisons 
were made between sexes and age groups (young, ≤19 years; middle, 20-24 years; 
older, ≥25 years). Significant main effects of sex were found, with females 
showing higher vertical loading rates during ruck marching, and peak tibial 
accelerations during running and ruck marching (p ≤ 0.03). Males showed higher 
vertical stiffness during running and peak vertical tibial accelerations during 
drop landings (p < 0.01). A main effect of age was found for vertical loading 
rates during running (p = 0.03), however no significant pairwise differences 
were found between age groups. These findings suggest that higher external 
loading may contribute to higher overall injury rates in female trainees. 
Further, higher stiffness during running may contribute to specific injuries, 
such as Achilles Tendinopathy, that are more prevalent in males. The lack of 
differences between age groups suggests that other factors contribute more to 
higher injury rates in older trainees.

Individuals exhibit significant variability in their ability to adapt locomotor 
skills, with some adapting quickly and others more slowly. Differences in brain 
activity likely contribute to this variability, but direct neural evidence is 
lacking. We investigated individual differences in electrocortical activity that 
led to faster locomotor adaptation rates. We recorded high-density 
electroencephalography while young, neurotypical adults adapted their walking on 
a split-belt treadmill and grouped them based on how quickly they restored their 
gait symmetry. Results revealed unique spectral signatures within the posterior 
parietal, bilateral sensorimotor, and right visual cortices that differ between 
fast and slow adapters. Specifically, fast adapters exhibited lower alpha power 
in the posterior parietal and right visual cortices during early adaptation, 
associated with quicker attainment of steady-state step length symmetry. 
Decreased posterior parietal alpha may reflect enhanced spatial attention, 
sensory integration, and movement planning to facilitate faster locomotor 
adaptation. Conversely, slow adapters displayed greater alpha and beta power in 
the right visual cortex during late adaptation, suggesting potential differences 
in visuospatial processing. Additionally, fast adapters demonstrated reduced 
spectral power in the bilateral sensorimotor cortices compared with slow 
adapters, particularly in the theta band, which may suggest variations in 
perception of the split-belt perturbation. These findings suggest that alpha and 
beta oscillations in the posterior parietal and visual cortices and theta 
oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex are related to the rate of gait 
adaptation.

We tested the hypothesis that compliance with the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) heat stress recommendations will prevent 
reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) across a range of wet-bulb globe 
temperatures (WBGTs) and work-rest ratios at a fixed work intensity. We also 
tested the hypothesis that noncompliance would result in a reduction in GFR 
compared with a work-rest matched compliant trial. Twelve healthy adults 
completed five trials (four NIOSH compliant and one noncompliant) that consisted 
of 4 h of exposure to a range of WBGTs. Subjects walked on a treadmill (heat 
production: approximately 430 W) and work-rest ratios (work/h: 60, 45, 30, and 
15 min) were prescribed as a function of WBGT (24°C, 26.5°C, 28.5°C, 30°C, and 
36°C), and subjects drank a sport drink ad libitum. Peak core temperature (TC) 
and percentage change in body weight (%ΔBW) were measured. Creatinine clearance 
measured pre- and postexposure provided a primary marker of GFR. Peak TC did not 
differ among NIOSH-compliant trials (P = 0.065) but differed between compliant 
versus noncompliant trials (P < 0.001). %ΔBW did not differ among 
NIOSH-compliant trials (P = 0.131) or between compliant versus noncompliant 
trials (P = 0.185). Creatinine clearance did not change or differ among 
compliant trials (P ≥ 0.079). Creatinine clearance did not change or differ 
between compliant versus noncompliant trials (P ≥ 0.661). Compliance with the 
NIOSH recommendations maintained GFR. Surprisingly, despite a greater heat 
strain in a noncompliant trial, GFR was maintained highlighting the potential 
relative importance of hydration.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We highlight that glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) is maintained during simulated occupational heat stress 
across a range of total work, work-rest ratios, and wet-bulb globe temperatures 
with ad libitum consumption of an electrolyte and sugar-containing sports drink. 
Compared with a work-rest matched compliant trial, noncompliance resulted in 
augmented heat strain but did not induce a reduction in GFR likely due to an 
increased relative fluid intake and robust fluid conservatory responses.

Revisiting classical experiments on the impact of air resistance on metabolic 
rate, we aimed to overcome limitations of previous research, notably: low 
participant numbers (n = 1-3), highly turbulent wind, and confounding effects of 
rising body temperature. In a custom-built wind tunnel with reduced turbulence, 
14 participants (8 males, 6 females) walked (5 km·h-1) and ran on a treadmill 
(70%V̇o2max) at 0, 2, 4, and 6 m·s-1 headwind or tailwind in a counterbalanced 
design, with rest breaks between each exposure to avoid rises in body core 
temperature. Oxygen consumption (V̇o2) exhibited strong linear relationships 
versus wind direction, dynamic pressure, and air speed squared (Vwr2), lower in 
magnitude for headwind than tailwind. A moderate linear relationship was 
observed between heart rate, wind direction, dynamic pressure, and Vwr2. Below 4 
m·s-1, the effect of wind was well within inter- and intraindividual variation 
and equipment uncertainty, and only at wind speeds ≥4 m·s-1 did the differences 
in physiological responses reach statistical significance. Our data indicate 
that at running speeds below 4 m·s-1 (14.4 km/h), indoor treadmills and outdoor 
running are comparable in terms of the metabolic impact of air movement relative 
to the person. However, this does not extend to the thermoregulatory effect of 
wind, with outdoor running providing a higher cooling rate due to the 
self-generated wind created during running. By removing the confounding impact 
of core temperature rises, the observed effects of headwind were lower and those 
of tailwind larger than observed previously. In the context of middle-distance 
running, the headwind created by running at 21.5 km·h-1 would result in a 2.2% 
increase of V̇o2. A relative tailwind of the same speed would lead to a 3.1% 
reduction.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Revisiting classical work by Pugh and Davies on the 
metabolic effects of air speed and direction, shortcomings in the original 
studies were addressed. Using more participants, less turbulent wind, and 
avoiding confounding effects of work-induced core temperature increases, new 
equations describing the impact of air speed/direction were developed. This 
study observed a lower impact of headwind and a larger impact of tailwind in the 
absence of an exercise-induced core temperature increase.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by motor impairments, especially in the area of gait disturbances. 
Physiotherapy, with a focus on task-specific training, has demonstrated a level 
of efficacy as regards alleviating symptoms and enhancing functional 
capabilities in individuals with PD. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic 
Stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a potential therapeutic intervention for 
improving motor functions in individuals with PD.
AIMS: This review article aims to investigate the effects of combining rTMS with 
task-specific training on gait performance in individuals with PD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), and 
Scopus were all searched for relevant studies. The focus of the search was on 
studies that investigated the efficacy of combining rTMS with task-specific 
training to improve gait performance in individuals with PD.
RESULTS: Four studies were identified as fulfilling the eligibility criteria and 
were included in the study. The combination of rTMS with specific treadmill 
training and weight-bearing exercises can significantly enhance walking 
efficiency, including improvements in walking speed, self-mobility, and step 
rate. In addition, the combination of rTMS and task-specific training, such as 
treadmill-based training, shows promise in enhancing gait performance in 
individuals with PD.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: High-frequency rTMS targeting the primary motor 
cortex (or M1) can result in improved walking speed, self-mobility, and step 
rate. However, limited research exists regarding low-frequency stimulation of 
the supplementary motor area (SMA) in individuals with gait issues. Further 
research is required to determine the optimal parameters of rTMS, such as 
strength, frequency, and duration of stimulation and it is worth considering the 
incorporation of additional training modalities, including cognitive exercises.

INTRODUCTION: Declines in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) have 
been proposed as a prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease (PD). The Cleveland 
Clinic Virtual Reality Shopping (CC-VRS) platform combines an omnidirectional 
treadmill with a virtual reality headset to create a virtual grocery store that 
a user physically walks through and completes a shopping task. The primary aim 
of this project was to determine the known-group validity of the CC-VRS platform 
in discriminating IADL performance and to characterize specific motor and 
cognitive declines responsible for PD-related IADL impairments.
METHODS: Sixteen individuals with PD and 15 healthy adults completed traditional 
motor, cognitive, and IADL assessments and the CC-VRS task. Group differences 
were evaluated using Welch's t-test.
RESULTS: There were no between-group differences in traditional performance 
measures of motor, cognitive, or IADL function. Regarding CC-VRS performance, 
participants in the PD group completed the task significantly slower than 
controls (690 vs. 523 sec, respectively). Participants with PD spent 25 % more 
time walking and turning and were stopped 46 % longer than controls. Average 
gait speed when viewing the shopping list, a measure of dual-task performance, 
was significantly slower in the PD group compared to controls (0.26 vs. 
0.17 m/s, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Unlike traditional performance measures of motor, cognitive, and 
IADL function, the CC-VRS discriminated participants with PD from healthy older 
adults. For the PD group, motor and dual-task declines contributed to diminished 
CC-VRS performance. Identifying underlying contributors to IADL declines 
supports using ecological assessments, such as the CC-VRS, for the routine 
clinical evaluation of IADLs.

L.H.S., C.J.V., E.I., C.E.H.).

BACKGROUND: Studies in individuals with chronic stroke indicate high-intensity 
training (HIT) focused on walking improves locomotor function, which may be due 
to repeated activation of locomotor circuits and serotonin-dependent modulation 
of motor output. Separate studies in animals and individuals with spinal cord 
injury suggest acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) can augment the effects of 
locomotor interventions through similar serotonin-dependent mechanisms, although 
no studies have coupled AIH with HIT in individuals poststroke. The goal of this 
study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AIH+HIT versus HIT alone in 
individuals with chronic stroke.
METHODS: This phase II double-blind randomized, crossover trial recruited 
individuals between 18 and 85 years old, >6 months poststroke, and self-selected 
speeds <1.0 m/s. Participants received up to 15 sessions of AIH for 30 minutes 
using 15 cycles of hypoxia (60-90 seconds; 8%-9% O2) and normoxia (30-60 
seconds; 21% O2), followed by 1 hour of HIT targeting >75% heart rate reserve. 
The control condition received normoxia for 30 minutes before HIT. Following the 
first training phase, participants performed the second phase >1 month later. 
The primary outcomes were self-selected speed and fastest speed, a 6-minute walk 
test, and peak treadmill speed. A 3-way mixed-model ANOVA assessed the effects 
of time, training, and order of interventions.
RESULTS: Of 55 individuals screened, 35 were randomized to AIH+HIT or 
normoxia+HIT first, and 28 individuals completed both interventions, revealing 
greater gains in self-selected speeds (0.14 [0.08-0.18] versus 0.05 [0.01-0.10] 
m/s), fastest speed (0.16 [0.10-0.21] versus 0.06 [0.02-0.10] m/s), and peak 
treadmill speed (0.21 [0.14-0.29] versus 0.11 [0.06-0.16] m/s) following AIH+HIT 
versus normoxia+HIT (P<0.01) with no order effects. Greater gains in 
spatiotemporal symmetry were observed with AIH+HIT, with worse outcomes for 
those prescribed serotonin-mediated antidepressant medications.
CONCLUSIONS: AIH+HIT resulted in greater gains in locomotor function than 
normoxia+HIT. Subsequent phase III trials should further evaluate the efficacy 
of this intervention.

AIMS: Impaired vision is an additional risk factor in elderly for falls. We 
investigated the hypothesis that treadmill (TM) walking affects visual function 
in both healthy elderly and those with early-moderate visual dysfunction due to 
glaucoma.
METHODS: Thirty healthy controls (HC) aged 64-83 years and 18 glaucoma patients 
(GLA) aged 62-82 years participated in this cross-sectional study. The impact of 
TM-walking on visual function was assessed binocularly for (i) best-corrected 
visual acuity (BCVA) with and without crowding effect, (ii) contrast sensitivity 
(CS), and (iii) and visual field (mean deviation, VF-MD). Visual function was 
tested while participants were standing or during TM-walking for 2 speed 
conditions: (i) fast walking at their preferred speed and (ii) walking at a 
fixed speed of 3.5 km/h.
RESULTS: GLA, most with early-moderate VF loss, performed equally well as HC. 
Independent of GROUP, an impact of SPEED on visual functions was statistically 
evident with large statistical effect size for (i) both types of BCVA with a 
mean loss of 0.02-0.05 logMAR (η2 = 0.41) and (ii) VF-MD with mean loss of 1 dB 
(η2 = 0.70), but not for CS.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we introduce a paradigm for the assessment of visual function 
during walking. We provide proof-of-concept that our approach allows for the 
identification of walking induced visual function loss, i.e., a deterioration of 
BCVA and VF-sensitivity during TM-walking in both groups. It is therefore of 
promise for the investigation of the relation of vision impairment and mobility, 
ultimately the increased frequency of falls in advanced glaucoma.

Rolling walkers are common walking aids for individuals with poor physical 
fitness or balance impairments. There is no doubt that rolling walkers are 
useful in assisting locomotion. On the other hand, it is arguable that walking 
with rolling walkers (WW) is effective for maintaining or restoring the nervous 
systems that are recruited during conventional walking (CW). This is because the 
differences and similarities of the neural control of these locomotion forms 
remain unknown. The purpose of the present study was to compare the neural 
control of WW and CW from the perspective of a split-belt adaptation paradigm 
and reveal how the adaptations that take place in WW and CW would affect each 
other. The anterior component of the ground reaction (braking) forces was 
measured during and after walking on a split-belt treadmill by 10 healthy 
subjects, and differences in the peak braking forces between the left and right 
sides were calculated as the index of the split-belt adaptation (the degree of 
asymmetry). The results demonstrated that (1) WW enabled subjects to respond to 
the split-belt condition immediately after its start as compared to CW; (2) the 
asymmetry movement pattern acquired by the split-belt adaptation in one gait 
mode (i.e., CW or WW) was less transferable to the other gait mode; (3) the 
asymmetry movement pattern acquired by the split-belt adaptation in CW was not 
completely washed out by subsequent execution in WW and vice versa. The results 
suggest unique control of WW and the specificity of neural control between WW 
and CW; use of the walkers is not necessarily appropriate as training for CW 
from the perspective of neural control.

Electrocortical theta activity may reflect sensory prediction errors during 
adaptation to a gradual gait perturbation.

Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States of America.

Locomotor adaptation to abrupt and gradual perturbations are likely driven by 
fundamentally different neural processes. The aim of this study was to quantify 
brain dynamics associated with gait adaptation to a gradually introduced gait 
perturbation, which typically results in smaller behavioral errors relative to 
an abrupt perturbation. Loss of balance during standing and walking elicits 
transient increases in midfrontal theta oscillations that have been shown to 
scale with perturbation intensity. We hypothesized there would be no significant 
change in anterior cingulate theta power (4-7 Hz) with respect to pre-adaptation 
when a gait perturbation is introduced gradually because the gradual 
perturbation acceleration and stepping kinematic errors are small relative to an 
abrupt perturbation. Using mobile electroencephalography (EEG), we measured 
gait-related spectral changes near the anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, 
sensorimotor, and posterior parietal cortices as young, neurotypical adults 
(n = 30) adapted their gait to an incremental split-belt treadmill perturbation. 
Most cortical clusters we examined (>70%) did not exhibit changes in 
electrocortical activity between 2-50 Hz. However, we did observe gait-related 
theta synchronization near the left anterior cingulate cortex during strides 
with the largest errors, as measured by step length asymmetry. These results 
suggest gradual adaptation with small gait asymmetry and perturbation magnitude 
may not require significant cortical resources beyond normal treadmill walking. 
Nevertheless, the anterior cingulate may remain actively engaged in error 
monitoring, transmitting sensory prediction error information via theta 
oscillations.

Older adults and neurological populations tend to walk with slower speeds, more 
gait variability, and a higher metabolic cost. This higher metabolic cost could 
be related to their increased gait variability, but this relationship is still 
unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine how increased step length 
variability affects the metabolic cost of waking. Eighteen healthy young adults 
completed a set of 5-minute trials of treadmill walking at 1.20 m/s while we 
manipulated their step length variability. Illuminated rectangles were projected 
onto the surface of a treadmill to cue step length variabilities of 0, 5 and 10% 
(coefficient of variation). Actual step lengths and their variability were 
tracked with reflective markers on the feet, while metabolic cost was measured 
using indirect calorimetry. Changes in metabolic cost across habitual walking 
(no projections) and the three variability conditions were analyzed using a 
linear mixed effects model. Metabolic power was largest in the 10% condition 
(4.30 ± 0.23 W/kg) compared to 0% (4.16 ± 0.18 W/kg) and habitual (3.98 ± 0.25 
W/kg). The participant's actual step length variability did not match projected 
conditions for 0% (3.10%) and 10% (7.03%). For every 1% increase in step length 
variability, there is an 0.7% increase in metabolic cost. Our results 
demonstrate an association between the metabolic cost of walking and gait step 
length variability. This suggests that increased gait variability contributes to 
a portion of the increased cost of walking seen in older adults and neurological 
populations.

BACKGROUND: Effectiveness of therapeutic footwear in reducing peak pressure in 
persons with diabetes and loss of protective sensation to prevent diabetic foot 
ulcers varies due to manual production and possible changing foot structure. A 
previous two-way approach to address this issue, featuring individualized 
3D-printed rocker midsoles and self-adjusting insoles, proved effective in the 
forefoot but less in the heel. To address this, new insoles incorporating a heel 
cup are developed.
METHODS: In-shoe pressure was measured, while persons with diabetes and loss of 
protective sensation with high peak pressure (≥ 200 kPa) in the heel walked on a 
treadmill with control and individualized rocker shoe paired with control and 
new insole.
FINDINGS: Generalized estimating equations revealed significant decrease in peak 
pressure in the proximal heel with the new insole alone and combined with rocker 
shoe compared to rocker shoe alone. For the distal heel, significant decrease in 
peak pressure is shown with the combination of new insole and rocker shoe 
compared to control shoe. For the forefoot and toes (excluding hallux) 
significant decrease in peak pressure is shown using the rocker shoe alone or 
combined with the heel cup compared to control shoe.
INTERPRETATION: The new insole paired with rocker shoe is effective in reducing 
peak pressure in the distal heel. To have similar (or more) success in proximal 
heel, one could replace the rocker midsole with more compliant materials. The 
rocker shoe used separately or combined with a heel cup effectively reduces the 
peak pressure in the forefoot and other toes.

A growing body of research suggests exercise improves inhibitory control 
functions. We tested if exercise-related inhibitory control benefits extend to 
food-related inhibitory control and differ by calorie content, time of day, and 
weight status. One hundred thirty-eight individuals were pseudo-randomly 
assigned to a morning or evening group. Each subject participated in two lab 
sessions where they completed questionnaires (rest session) or walked on a 
treadmill at 3.8mph (exercise session) for 45 min. After each session, 
participants completed both a high-calorie and low-calorie go/no-go task while 
N2 and P3 event-related potentials (ERP), both neural indicators of inhibitory 
control, were measured. Participants also rated food images for valence and 
arousal. While N2 and P3 difference amplitudes were larger to high-calorie than 
low-calorie foods, neither exercise nor time of day affected results. 
Individuals had faster response times after exercise without decreases in 
accuracy. Arousal and valence for high-calorie foods were lower after exercise 
and lower for all foods after morning compared to evening exercise. In a subset 
of individuals with obesity and normal-weight individuals, individuals with 
obesity had larger N2 difference amplitudes after morning exercise, while 
normal-weight individuals had larger P3 difference amplitudes to high-calorie 
foods after exercise. Results suggest moderate exercise did not affect 
food-related inhibitory control generally, although morning exercise may be 
beneficial in improving early recruitment of food-related inhibitory control in 
individuals with obesity. Moderate exercise, particularly in the morning, may 
also help manage increased attention allocated to food.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact on risk factors for recurrent stroke after gait 
training among persons restricted in walking in the chronic phase after stroke.
METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, two groups performed gait 
training, 1 session/day, 3 days/week for 6 weeks, including electromechanically 
assisted gait training on a treadmill (EAGT) (n=12) or variable conventional 
gait training only (n=15); a control group (n=11) continued as usual. Endurance 
assessed with the 6-minute walk test, blood pressure, weight and blood samples 
were collected at baseline and after 6 weeks. Total Cholesterol, High Density 
Lipoprotein Cholesterol, and Triglycerides in plasma, and HbA1c in blood 
(reflecting glucose levels) were analysed.
RESULTS: The EAGT group walked more than twice the distance compared to the 
Conventional training group while the effective training time was similar. 
Endurance in walking increased most in the Conventional group while the Control 
group declined. Systolic blood pressure decreased most in the Conventional 
group, with a moderate effect size (ŋp2) of 0.0921 (95% confidence interval 
(CI)0.0012-0.2598). Body weight decreased most in the EAGT group with a large 
effect size (ŋp2) of 0.1406 (95% CI0.0047-0.3452). Lipid levels exhibited 
non-conclusive changes and HbA1c did not change significantly in any group.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that six weeks of gait training may change risk 
factors for recurrent stroke even in persons restricted in mobility and that 
different training methods may have differential effects. These findings are in 
agreement with previous studies in less severely disabled persons and should 
encourage further studies in the current subgroup.

A single depth camera provides a fast and easy approach to performing 
biomechanical assessments in a clinical setting; however, there are currently no 
established methods to reliably determine joint angles from these devices. The 
primary aim of this study was to compare joint angles as well as the between-day 
reliability of direct kinematics to model-constrained inverse kinematics 
recorded using a single markerless depth camera during a range of clinical and 
athletic movement assessments.A secondary aim was to determine the minimum 
number of trials required to maximize reliability. Eighteen healthy participants 
attended two testing sessions one week apart. Tasks included treadmill walking, 
treadmill running, single-leg squats, single-leg countermovement jumps, 
bilateral countermovement jumps, and drop vertical jumps. Keypoint data were 
processed using direct kinematics as well as in OpenSim using a full-body 
musculoskeletal model and inverse kinematics. Kinematic methods were compared 
using statistical parametric mapping and between-day reliability was calculated 
using intraclass correlation coefficients, mean absolute error, and minimal 
detectable change. Keypoint-derived inverse kinematics resulted in significantly 
smaller hip flexion (range = -9 to -2°), hip abduction (range = -3 to -2°), knee 
flexion (range = -5° to -2°), and greater dorsiflexion angles (range = 6-15°) 
than direct kinematics. Both markerless kinematic methods had high between-day 
reliability (inverse kinematics ICC 95 %CI = 0.83-0.90; direct kinematics ICC 
95 %CI = 0.80-0.93). For certain tasks and joints, keypoint-derived inverse 
kinematics resulted in greater reliability (up to 0.47 ICC) and smaller minimal 
detectable changes (up to 13°) than direct kinematics. Performing 2-4 trials was 
sufficient to maximize reliability for most tasks. A single markerless depth 
camera can reliably measure lower limb joint angles, and skeletal 
model-constrained inverse kinematics improves lower limb joint angle reliability 
for certain tasks and joints.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease that damages the 
myelin sheath within the central nervous system. Axonal demyelination, 
particularly in the corpus callosum, impacts communication between the brain's 
hemispheres in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Changes in 
interhemispheric communication may impair gait coordination which is modulated 
by communication across the corpus callosum to excite and inhibit specific 
muscle groups. To further evaluate the functional role of interhemispheric 
communication in gait and mobility, this study assessed the ipsilateral silent 
period (iSP), an indirect marker of interhemispheric inhibition and how it 
relates to gait adaptation in PwMS.
METHODS: Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we assessed 
interhemispheric inhibition differences between the more affected and less 
affected hemisphere in the primary motor cortices in 29 PwMS. In addition, these 
same PwMS underwent a split-belt treadmill walking paradigm, with the faster 
paced belt moving under their more affected limb. Step length asymmetry (SLA) 
was the primary outcome measure used to assess gait adaptability during 
split-belt treadmill walking. We hypothesized that PwMS would exhibit 
differences in iSP inhibitory metrics between the more affected and less 
affected hemispheres and that increased interhemispheric inhibition would be 
associated with greater gait adaptability in PwMS.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in interhemispheric inhibition 
or conduction time were found between the more affected and less affected 
hemisphere. Furthermore, SLA aftereffect was negatively correlated with both 
average percent depth of silent period (dSP%AVE) (r = -0.40, p = 0.07) and max 
percent depth of silent period (dSP%MAX) r = -0.40, p = 0.07), indicating that 
reduced interhemispheric inhibition was associated with greater gait 
adaptability in PwMS.
CONCLUSION: The lack of differences between the more affected and less affected 
hemisphere indicates that PwMS have similar interhemispheric inhibitory capacity 
irrespective of the more affected hemisphere. Additionally, we identified a 
moderate correlation between reduced interhemispheric inhibition and greater 
gait adaptability. These findings may indicate that interhemispheric inhibition 
may in part influence responsiveness to motor adaptation paradigms and the need 
for further research evaluating the neural mechanisms underlying the 
relationship between interhemispheric inhibition and motor adaptability.

Used on clinical and sportive context, three-dimensional motion analysis is 
considered as the gold standard in the biomechanics field. The proposed dataset 
has been established on 30 asymptomatic young participants. Volunteers were 
asked to walk at slow, comfortable and fast speeds, and to run at comfortable 
and fast speeds on overground and treadmill using shoes. Three dimensional 
trajectories of 63 reflective markers, 3D ground reaction forces and moments 
were simultaneously recorded. A total of 4840 and 18159 gait cycles were 
measured for overground and treadmill walking, respectively. Additionally, 2931 
and 18945 cycles were measured for overground and treadmill running, 
respectively. The dataset is presented in C3D and CSV files either in raw or 
pre-processed format. The aim of this dataset is to provide a complete set of 
data that will help for the gait characterization during clinical gait analysis 
and in a sportive context. This data could be used for the creation of a 
baseline database for clinical purposes to research activities exploring the 
gait and the run.

General Treatments Promoting Independent Living in Parkinson's Patients and 
Physical Therapy Approaches for Improving Gait-A Comprehensive Review.

This study delves into the multifaceted approaches to treating Parkinson's 
disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting motor function 
but also manifesting in a variety of symptoms that vary greatly among 
individuals. The complexity of PD symptoms necessitates a comprehensive 
treatment strategy that integrates surgical interventions, pharmacotherapy, and 
physical therapy to tailor to the unique needs of each patient. Surgical 
options, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), have been pivotal for patients 
not responding adequately to medication, offering significant symptom relief. 
Pharmacotherapy remains a cornerstone of PD management, utilizing drugs like 
levodopa, dopamine agonists, and others to manage symptoms and, in some cases, 
slow down disease progression. However, these treatments often lead to 
complications over time, such as motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, 
highlighting the need for precise dosage adjustments and sometimes combination 
therapies to optimize patient outcomes. Physical therapy plays a critical role 
in addressing the motor symptoms of PD, including bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, 
tremors, postural instability, and akinesia. PT techniques are tailored to 
improve mobility, balance, strength, and overall quality of life. Strategies 
such as gait and balance training, strengthening exercises, stretching, and 
functional training are employed to mitigate symptoms and enhance functional 
independence. Specialized approaches like proprioceptive neuromuscular 
facilitation (PNF), the Bobath concept, and the use of assistive devices are 
also integral to the rehabilitation process, aimed at improving patients' 
ability to perform daily activities and reducing the risk of falls. Innovations 
in technology have introduced robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) and other 
assistive devices, offering new possibilities for patient care. These tools 
provide targeted support and feedback, allowing for more intensive and 
personalized rehabilitation sessions. Despite these advancements, high costs and 
accessibility issues remain challenges that need addressing. The inclusion of 
exercise and activity beyond structured PT sessions is encouraged, with evidence 
suggesting that regular physical activity can have neuroprotective effects, 
potentially slowing disease progression. Activities such as treadmill walking, 
cycling, and aquatic exercises not only improve physical symptoms but also 
contribute to emotional well-being and social interactions. In conclusion, 
treating PD requires a holistic approach that combines medical, surgical, and 
therapeutic strategies. While there is no cure, the goal is to maximize 
patients' functional abilities and quality of life through personalized 
treatment plans. This integrated approach, along with ongoing research and 
development of new therapies, offers hope for improving the management of PD and 
the lives of those affected by this challenging disease.

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is often used in poststroke gait 
rehabilitation to decrease foot drop and increase forward propulsion. However, 
not all stroke survivors experience clinically meaningful improvements in gait 
function following training with FES. The purpose of this work was to develop 
and validate a novel adaptive FES (AFES) system to improve dorsiflexor (DF) and 
plantarflexor (PF) stimulation timing and iteratively adjust the stimulation 
amplitude at each stride based on measured gait biomechanics. Stimulation timing 
was determined by a series of bilateral footswitches. Stimulation amplitude was 
calculated based on measured dorsiflexion angle and peak propulsive force, where 
increased foot drop and decreased paretic propulsion resulted in increased 
stimulation amplitudes. Ten individuals with chronic poststroke hemiparesis 
walked on an adaptive treadmill with adaptive FES for three 2-min trials. 
Stimulation was delivered at the correct time to the dorsiflexor muscles during 
95% of strides while stimulation was delivered to the plantarflexor muscles at 
the correct time during 84% of strides. Stimulation amplitudes were correctly 
calculated and delivered for all except two strides out of nearly 3000. The 
adaptive FES system responds to real-time gait biomechanics as intended, and 
further individualization to subject-specific impairments and rehabilitation 
goals may lead to improved rehabilitation outcomes.

Detection canines serve critical roles to support the military, homeland 
security and border protection. Some explosive detection tasks are physically 
demanding for dogs, and prior research suggests this can lead to a reduction in 
olfactory detection sensitivity. To further evaluate the effect of exercise 
intensity on olfactory sensitivity, we developed a novel olfactory paradigm that 
allowed us to measure olfactory detection thresholds while dogs exercised on a 
treadmill at two different exercise intensities. Dogs (n = 3) showed a decrement 
in olfactory detection for 1-bromooctane at 10-3 (v/v) dilutions and lower under 
greater exercise intensity. Dogs' hit rate for the lowest concentration dropped 
from 0.87 ± 0.04 when walking at low intensity to below 0.45 ± 0.06 when 
trotting at moderate intensity. This decline had an interaction with the 
duration of the session in moderate intensity exercise, whereby dogs performed 
near 100% detection in the first 10 min of the 8 km/h session, but showed 0% 
detection after 20 min. Hit rates for high odor concentrations (10-2) were 
relatively stable at both low (1 ± 0.00) and moderate (0.91 ± 0.04) exercise 
intensities. The paradigm and apparatus developed here may be useful to help 
further understand causes of operationally relevant olfactory detection 
threshold decline in dogs.

This study examined the effects of walking environments on state body 
satisfaction and state body appreciation and the potential moderating role of 
body sanctification. Participants included 189 undergraduates from a private 
Christian University in the Southwestern US, randomly assigned to walk for 
20-minutes in a natural, outdoors built, or indoors built environment. 
Participants completed measures of state body satisfaction and state body 
appreciation prior to and immediately following the walk. Those who walked in 
nature experienced increased state body satisfaction but not state body 
appreciation compared to those who walked in an indoor built environment. 
Theistic sanctification of the body was associated with greater state body 
appreciation and moderated the relationship between walking location and body 
appreciation. Participants who sanctified their bodies to a greater extent 
experienced increases in body appreciation when walking in a natural environment 
compared to an indoor built environment relative to those who were lower in body 
sanctification. Nontheistic sanctification of the body was associated with 
higher state body satisfaction and state body appreciation but did not moderate 
links between walking location and these outcomes. Overall, walking in nature is 
beneficial to body satisfaction and theistic sanctification of the body may 
bolster these effects.

BACKGROUND: In the process of transtibial prosthetic fitting, alignment is the 
process of positioning the prosthetic foot relative to the residual limb. 
Changes in frontal plane alignment can impact knee moments during walking, which 
can either cause or, when aligned properly, prevent injuries. However, clinical 
evaluation of dynamic knee moments is challenging, limiting prosthetists' 
insights into dynamic joint loading. Typically, knee joint loading is assessed 
in static stance using the knee moment arm as a proxy for subsequent dynamic 
alignment. It remains uncertain if static alignment accurately represents actual 
dynamics during walking.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Is the frontal knee moment arm in stance predictive for the 
knee moment arm and external knee adduction moment during gait in transtibial 
bone-anchored prosthesis users?
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, twenty-seven unilateral transtibial 
bone-anchored prosthesis users underwent data acquisition on the M-Gait 
instrumented treadmill. Static and dynamic measurements were conducted, and knee 
moment arm and external knee adduction moment were calculated. Pearson's 
correlation and linear regression analyses were performed to examine 
relationships between static and dynamic knee moment arms and external knee 
adduction moments.
RESULTS: The static knee moment arm showed significant associations with dynamic 
knee moment arm at the ground reaction force peaks (First: r=0.60, r2=35%, 
p<0.001; Second: r=0.62, r2=38%, p=0.001) and knee adduction moment (First: 
r=0.42, r2=17%, p=0.030; Second: r=0.59, r2=35%, p=0.001). A 1 mm 
between-subject difference in static knee moment arm corresponded, on average, 
with a 0.9% difference in knee adduction moment at the first peak and a 1.5% 
difference at the second peak of the ground reaction force.
SIGNIFICANCE: While static alignment is important to optimize adduction moments 
during stance it may only partly mitigate excessive moments during gait. The 
fair correlation and limited percentage of explained variance underscores the 
importance of dynamic alignment in optimizing the body's dynamic load during 
walking.

BACKGROUND: Millions of people are affected yearly by ""runner's knee"" and 
osteoarthritis, which is thought to be related to impact force. Millions are 
also affected by chronic falling, who are usually both difficult to identify and 
train. While at first glance, these topics seem to be entirely disconnected, 
there appears to be a need for a device that would address both issues. This 
paper proposes and investigates the use of the Variable Stiffness Treadmill 
(VST) as a targeted training device for the different populations described 
above.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The VST is the authors' unique robotic split-belt 
treadmill that can reduce the vertical ground stiffness of the left belt, while 
the right belt remains rigid. In this work, heart rate and energy expenditure 
are measured for healthy subjects in the challenging asymmetric environment 
created by the VST and compared to a traditional treadmill setting.
RESULTS: This study shows that this asymmetric environment results in an 
increase in heart rate and energy expenditure, an increase in activity in the 
muscles about the hip and knee, and a decrease in impact force at heel strike.
CONCLUSIONS: Compliant environments, like those created on the VST, may be a 
beneficial tool as they can: reduce high-impact forces during running and 
walking, significantly engage the muscles surrounding the hip and knee allowing 
for targeted training and rehabilitation, and assist in identifying and training 
high fall-risk individuals.

INTRODUCTION: Walking in complex environments increases the cognitive demand of 
locomotor control; however, our understanding of the neural mechanisms 
contributing to walking on uneven terrain is limited. We used a novel method for 
altering terrain unevenness on a treadmill to investigate the association 
between terrain unevenness and cortical activity in the prefrontal cortex, a 
region known to be involved in various cognitive functions.
METHODS: Prefrontal cortical activity was measured with functional near infrared 
spectroscopy while participants walked on a novel custom-made terrain treadmill 
surface across four different terrains: flat, low, medium, and high levels of 
unevenness. The assessments were conducted in younger adults, older adults with 
better mobility function and older adults with worse mobility function. Mobility 
function was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery. The primary 
hypothesis was that increasing the unevenness of the terrain would result in 
greater prefrontal cortical activation in all groups. Secondary hypotheses were 
that heightened prefrontal cortical activation would be observed in the older 
groups relative to the younger group, and that prefrontal cortical activation 
would plateau at higher levels of terrain unevenness for the older adults with 
worse mobility function, as predicted by the Compensation Related Utilization of 
Neural Circuits Hypothesis.
RESULTS: The results revealed a significant main effect of terrain, indicating a 
significant increase in prefrontal cortical activation with increasing terrain 
unevenness during walking in all groups. A significant main effect of group 
revealed that prefrontal cortical activation was higher in older adults with 
better mobility function compared to younger adults and older adults with worse 
mobility function in all pooled terrains, but there was no significant 
difference in prefrontal cortical activation between older adults with worse 
mobility function and younger adults. Contrary to our hypothesis, the older 
group with better mobility function displayed a sustained increase in activation 
but the other groups did not, suggestive of neural compensation. Additional 
findings were that task-related increases in prefrontal cortical activation 
during walking were lateralized to the right hemisphere in older adults with 
better mobility function but were bilateral in older adults with worse mobility 
function and younger adults.
DISCUSSION: These findings support that compared to walking on a flat surface, 
walking on uneven terrain surfaces increases demand on cognitive control 
resources as measured by prefrontal cortical activation.

BACKGROUND: Aerobic exercise (AEx) has many potential benefits; however, it is 
unknown whether individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) can attain the optimal 
intensity and duration to harness its effects. Forced-rate exercise (FE) is a 
novel paradigm in which the voluntary pedaling rate during cycling is 
supplemented to achieve a higher exercise intensity. The aim of this pilot trial 
was to investigate the feasibility and initial efficacy of a 12-week FE or 
voluntary exercise (VE) cycling intervention for individuals with MS.
METHODS: Twenty-two participants with MS (Expanded Disability Severity Scale 
[EDSS] 2.0-6.5) were randomly assigned to FE (n = 12) or VE (n = 10), each with 
twice weekly 45-minute sessions at a prescribed intensity of 60% to 80% of 
maximum heart rate (HR).
RESULTS: Eighteen individuals (FE = 11; VE = 7) completed the intervention, 
however, adaptations were required in both groups to overcome barriers to 
cycling. Overall, participants exercised for an average of 42.2 ± 2.3 minutes at 
an aerobic intensity of 65% ± 7% of maximum HR and a pedaling cadence of 67.3 ± 
13.3 RPM. Cycling led to improved treadmill walking speed (0.61 to 0.68 m/sec, P 
= .010), with somewhat greater improvement with FE compared to VE (increase of 
0.09 vs 0.03 m/s, respectively, P = .17) post intervention. Notably, the 
participant with the highest disability level (EDSS 6.5) tolerated FE but not 
VE.
CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise is feasible for individuals with MS, although 
those with increased disability may require novel paradigms such as FE to 
achieve targeted intensity. Further trials are warranted to investigate the 
effects of FE across the MS disability spectrum.

To determine whether body fat and body mass index (BMI) affect the energy cost 
of walking (Cw; J/kg/m), ventilation, and gas exchange data from 205 adults (115 
females; percent body fat range = 3.0%-52.8%; BMI range = 17.5-43.2 kg/m2) were 
obtained at rest and during treadmill walking at 1.34 m/s to calculate gross and 
net Cw. Linear regression was used to assess relationships between body 
composition indices, Cw, and standing metabolic rate (SMR). Unpaired t-tests 
were used to assess differences between sex, and one-way ANOVA was used to 
assess differences by BMI categories: normal weight, <25.0 kg/m2; overweight, 
25.0-29.9 km/m2; and obese, ≥30 kg/m2. Net Cw was not related to body fat 
percent, fat mass, or BMI (all R2 ≤ 0.011). Furthermore, mean net Cw was similar 
by sex (male: 2.19 ± 0.30 J/kg/m; female: 2.24 ± 0.37 J/kg/m, p = 0.35) and 
across BMI categories (normal weight: 2.23 ± 0.36 J/kg/m; overweight: 
2.18 ± 0.33 J/kg/m; obese: 2.26 ± 0.31, p = 0.54). Gross Cw and SMR were 
inversely associated with percent body fat, fat mass, and BMI (all R2 between 
0.033 and 0.270; all p ≤ 0.008). In conclusion, Net Cw is not influenced by body 
fat percentage, total body fat, and BMI and does not differ by sex.

BACKGROUND: The global number of people with diabetes is estimated to reach 643 
million by 2030 of whom 19-34% will present with diabetic foot ulceration. 
Insoles which offload high-risk ulcerative regions on the foot, by removing 
insole material, are the main contemporary conservative treatment to maintain 
mobility and reduce the likelihood of ulceration. However, their effect on the 
rest of the foot and relationship with key gait propulsive and balance 
kinematics and kinetics has not been well researched.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of offloading 
insoles on gait kinematics, kinetics, and plantar pressure throughout the gait 
cycle.
METHODS: 10 healthy subjects were recruited for this experiment to walk in 6 
different insole conditions. Subjects walked at three speeds on a treadmill for 
10 minutes while both plantar pressure and gait kinematics, kinetics were 
measured using an in-shoe pressure measurement insole and motion capture 
system/force plates. Average peak plantar pressure, pressure time integrals, 
gait kinematics and centre of force were analysed.
RESULTS: The average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integrals changed 
by -30% (-68% to 3%) and -36% (-75% to -1%) at the region of interest when 
applying offloading insoles, whereas the heel strike and toe-off velocity 
changed by 15% (-6% to 32%) and 12% (-2% to 19%) whilst walking at three speeds.
CONCLUSION: The study found that offloading insoles reduced plantar pressure in 
the region of interest with loading transferred to surrounding regions 
increasing the risk of higher pressure time integrals in these locations. Heel 
strike and toe-off velocities were increased under certain configurations of 
offloading insoles which may explain the higher plantar pressures and supporting 
the potential of integrating kinematic gait variables within a more optimal 
therapeutic approach. However, there was inter-individual variability in 
responses for all variables measured supporting individualised prescription.

Walking on sloped surfaces is challenging for many lower limb prosthesis users, 
in part due to the limited ankle range of motion provided by typical prosthetic 
ankle-foot devices. Adding a toe joint could potentially benefit users by 
providing an additional degree of flexibility to adapt to sloped surfaces, but 
this remains untested. The objective of this study was to characterize the 
effect of a prosthesis with an articulating toe joint on the preferences and 
gait biomechanics of individuals with unilateral below-knee limb loss walking on 
slopes. Nine active prosthesis users walked on an instrumented treadmill at a 
+5° incline and -5° decline while wearing an experimental foot prosthesis in two 
configurations: a Flexible toe joint and a Locked-out toe joint. Three 
participants preferred the Flexible toe joint over the Locked-out toe joint for 
incline and decline walking. Eight of nine participants went on to participate 
in a biomechanical data collection. The Flexible toe joint decreased prosthesis 
Push-off work by 2 Joules during both incline (p = 0.008; g = -0.63) and decline 
(p = 0.008; g = -0.65) walking. During incline walking, prosthetic limb knee 
flexion at toe-off was 3° greater in the Flexible configuration compared to the 
Locked (p = 0.008; g = 0.42). Overall, these results indicate that adding a toe 
joint to a passive foot prosthesis has relatively small effects on joint 
kinematics and kinetics during sloped walking. This study is part of a larger 
body of work that also assessed the impact of a prosthetic toe joint for level 
and uneven terrain walking and stair ascent/descent. Collectively, toe joints do 
not appear to substantially or consistently alter lower limb mechanics for 
active unilateral below-knee prosthesis users. Our findings also demonstrate 
that user preference for passive prosthetic technology may be both 
subject-specific and task-specific. Future work could investigate the 
inter-individual preferences and potential benefits of a prosthetic toe joint 
for lower-mobility individuals.

Visual information is essential to navigate the environment and maintain 
postural stability during gait. Visual field rotations alter the perceived 
heading direction, resulting in gait trajectory deviations, known as visual 
coupling. It is unclear how center of mass (CoM) control relative to a 
continuously changing base of support (BoS) is adapted to facilitate visual 
coupling. This study aimed to characterize mediolateral (ML) balance control 
during visual coupling in steady-state gait. Sixteen healthy participants walked 
on an instrumented treadmill, naive to sinusoidal low-frequency (0.1 Hz) 
rotations of the virtual environment around the vertical axis. Rotations were 
continuous with 1) high or 2) low amplitude or were 3) periodic with 10-s 
intervals. Visual coupling was characterized with cross-correlations between CoM 
trajectory and visual rotations. Balance control was characterized with the ML 
margin of stability (MoSML) and by quantifying foot placement control as the 
relation between CoM dynamics and lateral foot placement. Visual coupling was 
strong on a group level (continuous low: 0.88, continuous high: 0.91, periodic: 
0.95) and moderate to strong on an individual level. Higher rotation amplitudes 
induced stronger gait trajectory deviations. The MoSML decreased toward the 
deviation direction and increased at the opposite side. Foot placement control 
was similar compared with regular gait. Furthermore, pelvis and foot 
reorientation toward the rotation direction was observed. We concluded that 
visual coupling was facilitated by reorientating the body and shifting the 
extrapolated CoMML closer to the lateral BoS boundary toward the adjusted 
heading direction while preserving CoM excursion and foot placement control.NEW 
& NOTEWORTHY Healthy, naive participants were unaware of subtle, low-frequency 
rotations of the visual field but still coupled their gait trajectory to a 
rotating virtual environment. In response, participants decreased their margin 
of stability toward the new heading direction, without changing the center of 
mass excursion magnitude and foot placement strategy.

AdjuSST: An Adjustable Surface Stiffness Treadmill.

Price M, Locurto D, Abdikadirova B, Huber ME, Hoogkamer W.

Humans have the remarkable ability to manage foot-ground interaction seamlessly 
across terrain changes despite the high dynamic complexity of the task. 
Understanding how adaptation in the neuromotor system enables this level of 
robustness in the face of changing interaction dynamics is critical for 
developing more effective gait retraining interventions. We developed an 
adjustable surface stiffness treadmill (AdjuSST) to trigger these adaptation 
mechanisms and enable studies to better understand human adaptation to changing 
foot-ground dynamics. The AdjuSST system makes use of fundamental beam-bending 
principles; it controls surface stiffness by controlling the effective length of 
a cantilever beam. The beam acts as a spring suspension for the transverse 
endpoint load applied through the treadmill. The system is capable of enforcing 
a stiffness range of 15-300kN/m within 340 ms, deflecting linearly downwards up 
to 10 cm, and comfortably accommodating two full steps of travel along the belt. 
AdjuSST offers significant enhancements in effective walking surface length 
compared to similar systems, while also maintaining a useful stiffness range and 
responsive spring suspension. These improvements enhance our ability to study 
locomotor control and adaptation to changes in surface stiffness, as well as 
provide new avenues for gait rehabilitation.

Knee osteoarthritis is a major cause of global disability and is a major cost 
for the healthcare system. Lower extremity loading is a determinant of knee 
osteoarthritis onset and progression; however, technology that assists 
rehabilitative clinicians in optimizing key metrics of lower extremity loading 
is significantly limited. The peak vertical component of the ground reaction 
force (vGRF) in the first 50% of stance is highly associated with biological and 
patient-reported outcomes linked to knee osteoarthritis symptoms. Monitoring and 
maintaining typical vGRF profiles may support healthy gait biomechanics and 
joint tissue loading to prevent the onset and progression of knee 
osteoarthritis. Yet, the optimal number of sensors and sensor placements for 
predicting accurate vGRF from accelerometry remains unknown. Our goals were to: 
1) determine how many sensors and what sensor locations yielded the most 
accurate vGRF loading peak estimates during walking; and 2) characterize how 
prescribing different loading conditions affected vGRF loading peak estimates. 
We asked 20 young adult participants to wear 5 accelerometers on their waist, 
shanks, and feet and walk on a force-instrumented treadmill during control and 
targeted biofeedback conditions prompting 5% underloading and overloading vGRFs. 
We trained and tested machine learning models to estimate vGRF from the various 
sensor accelerometer inputs and identified which combinations were most 
accurate. We found that a neural network using one accelerometer at the waist 
yielded the most accurate loading peak vGRF estimates during walking, with 
average errors of 4.4% body weight. The waist-only configuration was able to 
distinguish between control and overloading conditions prescribed using 
biofeedback, matching measured vGRF outcomes. Including foot or shank 
acceleration signals in the model reduced accuracy, particularly for the 
overloading condition. Our results suggest that a system designed to monitor 
changes in walking vGRF or to deploy targeted biofeedback may only need a single 
accelerometer located at the waist for healthy participants.

The aim was to examine the effect of focus of attention cues on foot angle for 
retraining movement purposes. Twenty (females: 8) rearfoot-striking recreational 
runners (mass: 72.5 ± 11.8 kg; height: 1.73 ± 0.09 m; age: 32.9 ± 11.3 years) 
were randomly assigned to an internal focus (IF) (n = 10) or external focus (EF) 
(n = 10) verbal cue group. Participants performed 5 × 6 minute blocks of 
treadmill running (control run, 3 × cued running, retention run) at a 
self-selected running velocity (9.4 ± 1.1 km∙h-1) during a single laboratory 
visit. Touchdown foot angle, mechanical efficiency, internal and external work 
were calculated and, centre of mass (COM) and foot movement smoothness was 
quantified. Linear-mixed effect models showed an interaction for foot angle 
(p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.35) and mechanical efficiency (p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.40) when 
comparing the control to the cued running. Only the IF group reduced foot angle 
and mechanical efficiency during cued running, but not during the retention run. 
The IF group produced less external work during the 1st cued run than the 
control run. COM and foot smoothness were unaffected by cueing. Only an IF 
produced desired technique changes but at the cost of reduced mechanical 
efficiency. Movement smoothness was unaffected by cue provision. Changes to foot 
angle can be achieved within 6 minutes of gait retraining.

Biomechanical assessments of running typically take place inside motion capture 
laboratories. However, it is unclear whether data from these in-lab gait 
assessments are representative of gait during real-world running. This study 
sought to test how well real-world gait patterns are represented by in-lab gait 
data in two cohorts of runners equipped with consumer-grade wearable sensors 
measuring speed, step length, vertical oscillation, stance time, and leg 
stiffness. Cohort 1 (N = 49) completed an in-lab treadmill run plus five 
real-world runs of self-selected distances on self-selected courses. Cohort 2 (N 
= 19) completed a 2.4 km outdoor run on a known course plus five real-world runs 
of self-selected distances on self-selected courses. The degree to which in-lab 
gait reflected real-world gait was quantified using univariate overlap and 
multivariate depth overlap statistics, both for all real-world running and for 
real-world running on flat, straight segments only. When comparing in-lab and 
real-world data from the same subject, univariate overlap ranged from 65.7% (leg 
stiffness) to 95.2% (speed). When considering all gait metrics together, only 
32.5% of real-world data were well-represented by in-lab data from the same 
subject. Pooling in-lab gait data across multiple subjects led to greater 
distributional overlap between in-lab and real-world data (depth overlap 
89.3-90.3%) due to the broader variability in gait seen across (as opposed to 
within) subjects. Stratifying real-world running to only include flat, straight 
segments did not meaningfully increase the overlap between in-lab and real-world 
running (changes of <1%). Individual gait patterns during real-world running, as 
characterized by consumer-grade wearable sensors, are not well-represented by 
the same runner's in-lab data. Researchers and clinicians should consider 
""borrowing"" information from a pool of many runners to predict individual gait 
behavior when using biomechanical data to make clinical or sports performance 
decisions.

Virtual reality (VR) is used in many fields, including entertainment, education, 
training, and healthcare, because it allows users to experience challenging and 
dangerous situations that may be impossible in real life. Advances in 
head-mounted display technology have enhanced visual immersion, offering content 
that closely resembles reality. However, several factors can reduce VR 
immersion, particularly issues with the interactions in the virtual world, such 
as locomotion. Additionally, the development of locomotion technology is 
occurring at a moderate pace. Continuous research is being conducted using 
hardware such as treadmills, and motion tracking using depth cameras, but they 
are costly and space-intensive. This paper presents a walk-in-place (WIP) 
algorithm that uses Mocopi, a low-cost motion-capture device, to track user 
movements in real time. Additionally, its feasibility for VR applications was 
evaluated by comparing its performance with that of a treadmill using the 
absolute trajectory error metric and survey data collected from human 
participants. The proposed WIP algorithm with low-cost Mocopi exhibited 
performance similar to that of the high-cost treadmill, with significantly 
positive results for spatial awareness. This study is expected to contribute to 
solving the issue of spatial constraints when experiencing infinite virtual 
spaces.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize evidence regarding exercise treatments for lower 
extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD).
RECENT FINDINGS: Supervised walking exercise is recommended by practice 
guidelines for PAD. Supervised treadmill exercise improves treadmill walking 
distance by approximately 180 m and 6-min walk distance by 30-35 m, compared to 
control. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services covers 12 weeks of 
supervised exercise, but most people with PAD do not participate. Home-based 
walking exercise may be more convenient and accessible than supervised exercise. 
In randomized clinical trials, home-based walking exercise interventions 
incorporating behavioral methods, such as accountability to a coach, 
goal-setting, and self-monitoring, improved 6-min walk distance by 40-54 m, 
compared to control. Arm and leg ergometry also improved walking endurance for 
people with PAD, but efficacy compared to walking exercise remains unclear. 
Walking exercise is first-line therapy for PAD-related walking impairment and 
can be effective in either a supervised or a structured home-based setting.

BACKGROUND: Monitoring of gait patterns by insoles is popular to study behavior 
and activity in the daily life of people and throughout the rehabilitation 
process of patients. Live data analyses may improve personalized prevention and 
treatment regimens, as well as rehabilitation. The M-shaped plantar pressure 
curve during the stance phase is mainly defined by the loading and unloading 
slope, 2 maxima, 1 minimum, as well as the force during defined periods. When 
monitoring gait continuously, walking uphill or downhill could affect this curve 
in characteristic ways.
OBJECTIVE: For walking on a slope, typical changes in the stance phase curve 
measured by insoles were hypothesized.
METHODS: In total, 40 healthy participants of both sexes were fitted with 
individually calibrated insoles with 16 pressure sensors each and a recording 
frequency of 100 Hz. Participants walked on a treadmill at 4 km/h for 1 minute 
in each of the following slopes: -20%, -15%, -10%, -5%, 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 
20%. Raw data were exported for analyses. A custom-developed data platform was 
used for data processing and parameter calculation, including step detection, 
data transformation, and normalization for time by natural cubic spline 
interpolation and force (proportion of body weight). To identify the time-axis 
positions of the desired maxima and minimum among the available extremum 
candidates in each step, a Gaussian filter was applied (σ=3, kernel size 7). 
Inconclusive extremum candidates were further processed by screening for time 
plausibility, maximum or minimum pool filtering, and monotony. Several 
parameters that describe the curve trajectory were computed for each step. The 
normal distribution of data was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and 
Shapiro-Wilk tests.
RESULTS: Data were normally distributed. An analysis of variance with the gait 
parameters as dependent and slope as independent variables revealed significant 
changes related to the slope for the following parameters of the stance phase 
curve: the mean force during loading and unloading, the 2 maxima and the 
minimum, as well as the loading and unloading slope (all P<.001). A simultaneous 
increase in the loading slope, the first maximum and the mean loading force 
combined with a decrease in the mean unloading force, the second maximum, and 
the unloading slope is characteristic for downhill walking. The opposite 
represents uphill walking. The minimum had its peak at horizontal walking and 
values dropped when walking uphill and downhill alike. It is therefore not a 
suitable parameter to distinguish between uphill and downhill walking.
CONCLUSIONS: While patient-related factors, such as anthropometrics, injury, or 
disease shape the stance phase curve on a longer-term scale, walking on slopes 
leads to temporary and characteristic short-term changes in the curve 
trajectory.

BACKGROUND: The ability to walk safely after head and neck reconstruction with 
fibular free flaps in tumor surgery is a high priority for patients. In 
addition, surgeons and patients require objective knowledge of the functional 
donor-site morbidity. However, the effects of fibular free flap surgery on gait 
asymmetries have only been studied for step length and stance duration. This 
study analyses whether patients who have undergone fibular free flap 
reconstruction have enduring gait asymmetries compared to age-matched controls.
METHODS: Patients who underwent head and neck reconstruction with fibular free 
flaps between 2019 and 2023 were recruited, as well as age-matched controls. 
Participants walked on an instrumented treadmill at 3 km/h. The primary outcome 
measures were 22 gait asymmetry metrics. Secondary outcome measures were the 
associations of gait asymmetry with the length of the harvested fibula, and with 
the time after surgery.
FINDINGS: Nine out of 13 recruited patients completed the full assessment 
without holding on to the handrail on the treadmill. In addition, nine 
age-matched controls were enrolled. Twenty out of the 22 gait asymmetry 
parameters of patients were similar to healthy controls, while push-off peak 
force (p = 0.008) and medial impulse differed (p = 0.003). Gait asymmetry did 
not correlate with the length of the fibula harvested. Seven gait asymmetry 
parameters had a strong correlation with the time after surgery.
INTERPRETATION: On the long-term, fibular free flap reconstruction has only a 
limited effect on the asymmetry of force-related and temporal gait parameters 
while walking on a treadmill.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit motor deficits 
that increase their risk of falls. There is a lack of understanding regarding 
gait biomechanics demonstrated by older children with ASD. The purpose of the 
study was to determine differences in gait patterns between older children with 
ASD and typically developing children. Eleven children with ASD and 11 age- and 
gender-matched typically developing children were recruited for the study. 
Participants walked on a force-instrumented treadmill at a constant speed 
(1.1 ​m/s ​- ​1.2 ​m/s) for five minutes (min). Participants performed maximal 
voluntary contractions to assess their knee muscular strength. Differences 
between individuals with ASD and matched control participants were examined 
through paired t-tests with a significance level of p ​≤ ​0.05. Individuals with 
ASD demonstrated a smaller knee extensor torque compared to controls 
(p ​= ​0.002). Participants with ASD exhibited a shorter stride length 
(p ​= ​0.04), a greater cadence (p ​= ​0.03), and a higher variation in stride 
width (p ​= ​0.04) compared to control participants. The individuals with ASD 
experienced a greater braking ground reaction force (p ​= ​0.03) during loading 
response. The results indicate older children with ASD develop a unique gait 
pattern signified by a reduced stride length, increased cadence, and an increase 
of variation in stride width. This unique gait pattern may represent a movement 
strategy used by the individuals with ASD to compensate for the weakness 
associated with their knee extensor muscles. Individuals with ASD who 
demonstrate these unique gait deviations may face reduced postural stability and 
an increased risk of fall-related injuries.

BACKGROUND: Load carriage imposes high physical stresses on the human body, 
increasing the risk of injuries. This study assessed the effectiveness of a 
passive military exoskeleton in off-loading the weight placed on the body during 
heavy load carriage under static standing and dynamic walking conditions.
METHODS: Eight full-time regular personnel of the Singapore Armed Forces 
enrolled in the study. Static loading tests included nine trials of 10-s quiet 
standing while carrying different loads (0-55 kg) with and without the 
exoskeleton. For dynamic loading, participants walked on a treadmill on flat, 
inclined, and declined surfaces while carrying two different loads (25 kg, 35 
kg) with and without the exoskeleton. In-shoe normal ground reaction forces 
(GRF) were recorded during quiet standing and treadmill walking. Differences in 
total force with and without the exoskeleton during static loading were compared 
using Wilcoxon one-sample signed ranked tests against zero (no weight off-load) 
as a reference. Statistical parametric mapping test was used to compare the 
walking in-shoe GRF-time series with and without exoskeleton use for each load 
and surface condition.
RESULTS: Exoskeleton use was effective in off-loading loads of 2.3-13.5 kg 
during static quiet standing but the response varied substantially across loads 
and among the participants. Statistical analysis revealed no meaningful 
differences in the walking in-shoe GRF with and without exoskeleton use. The 
results were largely consistent across flat, inclined, and declined surfaces, 
and both 25-kg and 35-kg loads.
CONCLUSIONS: The passive military exoskeleton was effective in off-loading some 
load from the human body during static quiet standing but not dynamic walking on 
flat and sloped surfaces. The varied response across loads and participants 
calls for better design and fitting of the military exoskeleton to individual 
users.

The extent to which healthy older adults rely on anticipatory control following 
simulated slip exposure.

As the recovery from gait perturbations is coordinatively complex and 
error-prone, people often adopt anticipatory strategies when the perturbation is 
expected. These anticipatory strategies act as a first line of defence against 
potential balance loss. Since age-related changes in the sensory and neuromotor 
systems could make the recovery from external perturbations more difficult, it 
is important to understand how older adults implement anticipatory strategies. 
Therefore, we exposed healthy young (N = 10, 22 ± 1.05 yrs.) and older adults 
(N = 10, 64.2 ± 6.07 yrs.) to simulated slips on a treadmill with consistent 
properties and assessed if the reliance on anticipatory control differed between 
groups. Results showed that for the unperturbed steps in between perturbations, 
step length decreased and the backward (BW) margin of stability (MOS) increased 
(i.e., enhanced dynamic stability against backward loss of balance) in the leg 
that triggered the slip, while step lengths increased and BW MOS decreased in 
the contralateral leg. This induced step length and BW MOS asymmetry was 
significantly larger for older adults. When exposed to a series of predictable 
slips, healthy older adults thus rely more heavily on anticipatory control to 
proactively accommodate the expected backward loss of balance.

BACKGROUND: The vertical toe position at minimum toe clearance (MTC) in the 
swing phase is critical for walking safety. Consequently, the joints involved 
should be strictly controlled and coordinated to stabilize the foot at MTC. The 
uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis framework has been used to determine the 
existence of synergies that stabilize relevant performance variables during 
walking. However, no study investigated the presence of a multi-joint synergy 
stabilizing the foot position at MTC and the effects of age and walking speed on 
this synergy.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Is there a multi-joint synergy stabilizing MTC during 
treadmill walking? Does it depend on the persons' age and walking speed?
METHODS: Kinematic data from 23 young and 15 older adults were analyzed using 
the UCM approach. The participants walked on a treadmill at three speeds: slow, 
self-selected, and fast. The sagittal and frontal joint angles from the swing 
and stance legs and pelvis obliquity were used as motor elements and the 
vertical toe position at MTC was the performance variable. The variances in the 
joint space that affected (VORT, 'bad' variance) and did not affect (VUCM, 
'good' variance) the toe position at MTC and the synergy index (ΔV) were 
computed.
RESULTS: The ΔV>0 was revealed for all subjects. Walking speed did not affect ΔV 
in older adults, whereas ΔV reduced with speed in young adults. ΔV was higher 
for older than for young adults at self-selected and fast speeds, owing to a 
lower VORT in the older group.
SIGNIFICANCE: The vertical toe position at MTC was stabilized by a strong 
multi-joint synergy. In older adults, this synergy was stronger, as they were 
better at limiting VORT than young adults. Reduced VORT in older adults could be 
caused by more constrained walking, which may be associated with anxiety due to 
walking on a treadmill.

Self-assessed driving ability may differ from actual driving performance, 
leading to poor calibration (i.e., differences between self-assessed driving 
ability and actual performance), increased risk of accidents and unsafe driving 
behaviour. Factors such as sleep restriction and sedentary behaviour can impact 
driver workload, which influences driver calibration. This study aims to 
investigate how sleep restriction and prolonged sitting impact driver workload 
and driver calibration to identify strategies that can lead to safer and better 
calibrated drivers. Participants (n = 84, mean age = 23.5 ± 4.8, 49 % female) 
undertook a 7-day laboratory study and were randomly allocated to a condition: 
sitting 9-h sleep opportunity (Sit9), breaking up sitting 9-h sleep opportunity 
(Break9), sitting 5-h sleep opportunity (Sit5) and breaking up sitting 5-h sleep 
opportunity (Break5). Break9 and Break5 conditions completed 3-min of 
light-intensity walking on a treadmill every 30 min between 09:00-17:00 h, while 
participants in Sit9 and Sit5 conditions remained seated. Each participant 
completed a 20-min simulated commute in the morning and afternoon each day and 
completed subjective assessments of driving ability and perceived workload 
before and after each commute. Objective driving performance was assessed using 
a driving simulator measuring speed and lane performance metrics. Driver 
calibration was analysed using a single component and 3-component Brier Score. 
Correlational matrices were conducted as an exploratory analysis to understand 
the strength and direction of the relationship between subjective and objective 
driving outcomes. Analyses revealed participants in Sit9 and Break9 were 
significantly better calibrated for lane variability, lane position and safe 
zone-lane parameters at both time points (p < 0.0001) compared to Sit5 and 
Break5. Break5 participants were better calibrated for safe zone-speed and 
combined safe zone parameters (p < 0.0001) and speed variability at both time 
points (p = 0.005) compared to all other conditions. Analyses revealed lower 
perceived workload scores at both time points for Sit9 and Break9 participants 
compared to Sit5 and Break5 (p = <0.001). Breaking up sitting during the day may 
reduce calibration errors compared to sitting during the day for speed keeping 
parameters. Future studies should investigate if different physical activity 
frequency and intensity can reduce calibration errors, and better align a 
driver's self-assessment with their actual performance.

dual-task walking study.

BACKGROUND: The use of mobile exoskeletons as assistive walking devices has the 
potential to affect the biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system due to their 
weight and restricted range of motion. This may result in physical and cognitive 
load for the user. Understanding how lower extremity loading affects 
cognitive-motor interference is crucial for the design of wearable devices, 
including powered exoskeletons, and the development of effective training 
interventions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the effects of modified leg mechanics on 
cognitive-motor interference in dual-task walking. Gait variability, as an 
indicator of motor control, was analyzed to investigate its relation to 
cognitive task difficulty and to determine whether lower extremity loading 
modifies this relationship. Additionally, the impact on the gait pattern, as 
represented by the mean values of spatio-temporal gait parameters were 
investigated.
METHOD: Fifteen healthy young adults walked on a treadmill with and without 
weight cuffs bilaterally attached to their thighs and shanks while performing a 
visual-verbal Stroop test (simple task) and a serial subtraction task (difficult 
task). Dependent variables include mean values and variability (coefficients of 
variation) of step length, step width, stride time and double support time. 
Additionally, secondary task performance as correct response rates and perceived 
workload were assessed.
RESULTS: Double support time variability decreased during dual-task walking, but 
not during walking with modified leg mechanics while performing the difficult 
secondary task. Walking with modified leg mechanics resulted in increased gait 
variability compared to normal walking, regardless of cognitive load. During 
walking with modified leg mechanics, step length, step width, and stride time 
increased, while double support time decreased. The secondary tasks did not 
affect the gait pattern.
CONCLUSION: The interplay between an external focus of attention and competition 
for attentional resources may influence the variability of double support time. 
The findings suggest that walking with modified leg mechanics could increase 
cognitive-motor interference for healthy young adults in demanding dual-task 
situations. Therefore, it is important to analyze the underlying mechanisms of 
cognitive-motor interference in the context of human-exoskeleton interaction.

Control of foot placement is an essential strategy for maintaining balance 
during walking. During unperturbed, steady-state walking, foot placement can be 
accurately described as a linear function of the body's centre of mass (CoM) 
state at midstance. However, it is uncertain if this mapping from CoM state to 
foot placement generalizes to larger perturbations that could potentially cause 
falls. Recovery from these perturbations may require reactive control strategies 
not observed during unperturbed walking. Here, we used unpredictable changes in 
treadmill belt speed to assess the generalizability of foot placement mappings 
identified during unperturbed walking. We found that foot placement mappings 
generalized poorly from unperturbed to perturbed walking and differed for 
forward perturbation versus backward perturbation. We also used the singular 
value decomposition of the mapping matrix to reveal that people were more 
sensitive to backward versus forward perturbations. Together, these results 
indicate that a single linear mapping cannot describe the foot placement control 
during both forward and backward losses of balance induced by treadmill belt 
speed perturbations. Better characterization of human balance control strategies 
could improve our understanding of why different neuromotor disorders result in 
heightened fall risk and inform the design of controllers for balance-assisting 
devices.

BACKGROUND: Humans have a remarkable capability to maintain balance while 
walking. There is, however, a lack of publicly available research data on 
reactive responses to destabilizing perturbations during gait.
METHODS: Here, we share a comprehensive dataset collected from 10 participants 
who experienced random perturbations while walking on an instrumented treadmill. 
Each participant performed six 5-min walking trials at a rate of 1.2 m/s, during 
which rapid belt speed perturbations could occur during the participant's stance 
phase. Each gait cycle had a 17% probability of being perturbed. The 
perturbations consisted of an increase of belt speed by 0.75 m/s, delivered with 
equal probability at 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% of the stance 
phase. Data were recorded using motion capture with 25 markers, eight inertial 
measurement units (IMUs), and electromyography (EMG) from the tibialis anterior 
(TA), soleus (SOL), lateral gastrocnemius (LG), rectus femoris (RF), vastus 
lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris (BF), and gluteus maximus 
(GM). The full protocol is described in detail.
RESULTS: We provide marker trajectories, force plate data, EMG data, and belt 
speed information for all trials and participants. IMU data is provided for most 
participants. This data can be useful for identifying neural feedback control in 
human gait, biologically inspired control systems for robots, and the 
development of clinical applications.

AIM: The treadmill walking test with post-exercise pressure measurement can be 
used as a diagnostic test and could classify peripheral arterial disease of the 
lower limbs. It can also exclude the diagnosis allowing to raise the possibility 
of differential diagnoses. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of 
performing treadmill test by advanced practice nurse to assess suspected lower 
extremity peripheral artery disease patients.
DESIGN AND METHOD: This is a longitudinal monocentric study to assess the 
feasibility of a treadmill walking test performed by an advanced practice nurse. 
The primary endpoint was the number of tests performed during this period. The 
secondary objectives were to evaluate the reasons for requesting the test, the 
main results obtained in terms of the test's contribution and diagnoses, and 
patients' clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: From February to May 2023, amongst 31 patients who underwent the 
treadmill walking test, 4 tests were able to rule out peripheral arterial 
disease and to detect differential diagnoses. For the remaining 27 patients, 4 
had stage IIa of the Leriche classification, 23 had stage IIb, 2 of which were 
associated with a narrow lumbar spine. In contrast to the usual report, the 
APN's report on the walking test included an identification of cardiovascular 
risk factors, as well as a possible medical reorientation linked to the 
correction of a detected cardiovascular risk factor.
CONCLUSION: The treadmill walking test can be performed by an advanced practice 
nurse. He/She added a comprehensive/global patient management, with the 
detection of cardiovascular risk factors. This new profession led to an increase 
in the number of tests performed of more than 50% over the period and reduced 
the time to access the test.

BACKGROUND: Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) are commonly used to overcome mobility 
limitations related to lower limb musculoskeletal injury. Despite a multitude of 
AFOs to choose from, there is scant evidence to guide AFO prescription and 
limited opportunities for AFO users to provide experiential input during the 
process. To address these limitations in the current prescription process, this 
study evaluates a novel, user-centered and personalized 'test-drive' strategy 
using a robotic exoskeleton ('AFO emulator') to emulate commercial AFO 
mechanical properties (i.e., stiffness). The study will determine if brief, 
in-lab trials (with emulated or actual AFOs) can predict longer term preference, 
satisfaction, and mobility outcomes after community trials (with the actual 
AFOs). Secondarily, it will compare the in-lab experience of walking between 
actual vs. emulated AFOs.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this participant-blinded, randomized crossover study we 
will recruit up to fifty-eight individuals with lower limb musculoskeletal 
injuries who currently use an AFO. Participants will walk on a treadmill with 
three actual AFOs and corresponding emulated AFOs for the ""in-lab"" assessments. 
For the community trial assessment, participants will wear each of the actual 
AFOs for a two-week period during activities of daily living. Performance-based 
and user-reported measures of preference and mobility will be compared between 
short- and long-term trials (i.e., in-lab vs. two-week community trials), and 
between in-lab trials (emulated vs. actual AFOs).

BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is characterised by obstruction or 
narrowing of the large arteries of the lower limbs, usually caused by 
atheromatous plaques. Most people with PAD who experience intermittent leg pain 
(intermittent claudication) are typically treated with secondary prevention 
strategies, including medical management and exercise therapy. Lower limb 
revascularisation may be suitable for people with significant disability and 
those who do not show satisfactory improvement after conservative treatment. 
Some studies have suggested that lower limb revascularisation for PAD may not 
confer significantly more benefits than supervised exercise alone for improved 
physical function and quality of life. It is proposed that supervised exercise 
therapy as adjunctive treatment after successful lower limb revascularisation 
may confer additional benefits, surpassing the effects conferred by either 
treatment alone.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of a supervised exercise programme versus 
standard care following successful lower limb revascularisation in people with 
PAD.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, 
MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trial registers, most recently on 
14 March 2023.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials which compared 
supervised exercise training following lower limb revascularisation with 
standard care following lower limb revascularisation in adults (18 years and 
older) with PAD.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary 
outcomes were maximum walking distance or time (MWD/T) on the treadmill, 
six-minute walk test (6MWT) total distance, and pain-free walking distance or 
time (PFWD/T) on the treadmill. Our secondary outcomes were changes in the 
ankle-brachial index, all-cause mortality, changes in health-related 
quality-of-life scores, reintervention rates, and changes in subjective measures 
of physical function. We analysed continuous data by determining the mean 
difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI), and dichotomous data by 
determining the odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% CI. We used GRADE to 
assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified seven studies involving 376 participants. All 
studies involved participants who received either additional supervised exercise 
or standard care after lower limb revascularisation. The studies' exercise 
programmes varied, and included supervised treadmill walking, combined exercise, 
and circuit training. The duration of exercise therapy ranged from six weeks to 
six months; follow-up time ranged from six weeks to five years. Standard care 
also varied between studies, including no treatment or advice to stop smoking, 
lifestyle modifications, or best medical treatment. We classified all studies as 
having some risk of bias concerns. The certainty of the evidence was very low 
due to the risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. The meta-analysis 
included only a subset of studies due to concerns regarding data reporting, 
heterogeneity, and bias in most published research. The evidence was of very low 
certainty for all the review outcomes. Meta-analysis comparing changes in 
maximum walking distance from baseline to end of follow-up showed no improvement 
(MD 159.47 m, 95% CI -36.43 to 355.38; I2 = 0 %; 2 studies, 89 participants). In 
contrast, exercise may improve the absolute maximum walking distance at the end 
of follow-up compared to standard care (MD 301.89 m, 95% CI 138.13 to 465.65; I2 
= 0 %; 2 studies, 108 participants). Moreover, we are very uncertain if there 
are differences in the changes in the six-minute walk test total distance from 
baseline to treatment end between exercise and standard care (MD 32.6 m, 95% CI 
-17.7 to 82.3; 1 study, 49 participants), and in the absolute values at the end 
of follow-up (MD 55.6 m, 95% CI -2.6 to 113.8; 1 study, 49 participants). 
Regarding pain-free walking distance, we are also very uncertain if there are 
differences in the mean changes in PFWD from baseline to treatment end between 
exercise and standard care (MD 167.41 m, 95% CI -11 to 345.83; I2 = 0%; 2 
studies, 87 participants). We are very uncertain if there are differences in the 
absolute values of ankle-brachial index at the end of follow-up between the 
intervention and standard care (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.12; I2 = 62%; 2 
studies, 110 participants), in mortality rates at the end of follow-up (OR 0.92, 
95% CI 0.42 to 2.00; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 346 participants), health-related 
quality of life at the end of follow-up for the physical (MD 0.73, 95% CI -5.87 
to 7.33; I2 = 64%; 2 studies, 105 participants) and mental component (MD 1.04, 
95% CI -6.88 to 8.95; I2 = 70%; 2 studies, 105 participants) of the 36-item 
Short Form Health Survey. Finally, there may be little to no difference in 
reintervention rates at the end of follow-up between the intervention and 
standard care (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.65; I2 = 65%; 5 studies, 252 
participants).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very uncertain evidence that additional exercise 
therapy after successful lower limb revascularisation may improve absolute 
maximal walking distance at the end of follow-up compared to standard care. 
Evidence is also very uncertain about the effects of exercise on pain-free 
walking distance, six-minute walk test distance, quality of life, ankle-brachial 
index, mortality, and reintervention rates. Although it is not possible to 
confirm the effectiveness of supervised exercise compared to standard care for 
all outcomes, studies did not report any harm to participants from this 
intervention after lower limb revascularisation. Overall, the evidence 
incorporated into this review was very uncertain, and additional evidence is 
needed from large, well-designed, randomised controlled studies to more 
conclusively demonstrate the role additional exercise therapy has after lower 
limb revascularisation in people with PAD.

Older adults have a decreased trunk movement control which is linked to their 
higher fall risk. While motor/cognitive dual-tasking deteriorates balance and 
walking in older adults, there is limited understanding on how trunk kinematics 
and kinetics are affected by dual-tasking in scenarios where falls can occur. 
Therefore, the purpose of the study was to determine the impacts of a 
challenging motor dual-task, specifically obstacle avoidance during walking, on 
trunk and lower-body kinematics and kinetics of older adults compared to young 
adults. The study captured three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data from 12 
young adults and 10 older adults as they walked on a treadmill and stepped over 
an obstacle with both legs. The study analyzed trunk, hip, knee, and ankle 
angles and torques. Trunk torque was further broken down to trunk muscle torque, 
gravitational torque, and inertia torque. A linear mixed effects model was used 
to investigate the difference in each variable between the two groups. Older 
adults exhibited significantly increased trunk flexion angle and trunk extension 
muscle torque compared to young adults, with the trunk being the only 
segment/joint showing differences in both kinematics and kinetics. Trunk torque 
breakdown analysis revealed that larger trunk flexion led to a larger 
gravitational torque, which contributed to an increased compensatory trunk 
muscle torque. Moreover, older adults' less controlled trunk flexion during 
weight shifting from trail leg to the lead leg, necessitated a compensatory 
trunk deceleration during trail leg obstacle avoidance which was achieved by 
generating additional increase in trunk muscle torque. The study demonstrated 
that motor dual-tasking has the most negative effects on trunk control in older 
adults compared to young adults. This exposes older adults to a higher fall 
risk. Therefore, future work should focus on supporting trunk control during 
daily multi-tasking conditions where falls can occur.

BACKGROUND: The ability to walk is a key issue for independent old age. 
Optimizing older peoples' opportunities for an autonomous and active life and 
reducing health disparities requires a better understanding of how to support 
independent mobility in older people. With increasing age, changes in gait 
parameters such as step length and cadence are common and have been shown to 
increase the risk of mobility decline. However, gait assessments are typically 
based on laboratory measures, even though walking in a laboratory environment 
may be significantly different from walking in outdoor environments.
OBJECTIVE: This project will study alterations in biomechanical features of gait 
by comparing walking on a treadmill in a laboratory, level outdoor, and hilly 
outdoor environments. In addition, we will study the possible contribution of 
changes in gait between these environments to outdoor mobility among older 
people.
METHODS: Participants of the study were recruited through senior organizations 
of Central Finland and the University of the Third Age, Jyväskylä. Inclusion 
criteria were community-dwelling, aged 70 years and older, able to walk at least 
1 km without assistive devices, able to communicate, and living in central 
Finland. Exclusion criteria were the use of mobility devices, severe sensory 
deficit (vision and hearing), memory impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination 
≤23), and neurological conditions (eg, stroke, Parkinson disease, and multiple 
sclerosis). The study protocol included 2 research visits. First, indoor 
measurements were conducted, including interviews (participation, health, and 
demographics), physical performance tests (short physical performance battery 
and Timed Up and Go), and motion analysis on a treadmill in the laboratory (3D 
Vicon and next-generation inertial measurement units [NGIMUs]). Second, outdoor 
walking tests were conducted, including walking on level (sports track) and 
hilly (uphill and downhill) terrain, while movement was monitored via NGIMUs, 
pressure insoles, heart rate, and video data.
RESULTS: A total of 40 people (n=26, 65% women; mean age 76.3, SD 5.45 years) 
met the inclusion criteria and took part in the study. Data collection took 
place between May and September 2022. The first result is expected to be 
published in the spring of 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: This multidisciplinary study will provide new scientific knowledge 
about how gait biomechanics are altered in varied environments, and how this 
influences opportunities to participate in outdoor activities for older people.

Neurometabolic disorders encompass a diverse group of conditions characterized 
by inborn errors of metabolism, affecting various aspects of neurological 
function. This case report focuses on an 11-year-old male child with a 
neurometabolic disorder who presents with walking difficulties, speech 
impairment, and neurological symptoms. The background emphasizes the 
heterogeneity of neurometabolic disorders, their genetic and clinical 
complexity, and the need for tailored interventions to address specific 
manifestations. The primary aim of this study is to implement a comprehensive 
physiotherapy intervention plan for an 11-year-old male child with a 
neurometabolic disorder, targeting the improvement of gait abnormalities, 
regaining developmental milestones, and addressing associated challenges such as 
fatigue. The physiotherapy intervention plan employs a multifaceted approach, 
incorporating principles of neuroplasticity, motor learning, and adaptive 
strategies. A comprehensive gait training protocol involves proper orthotic 
fitting, forearm support walker training, treadmill exercises, and parallel bar 
training. Developmental milestones are addressed through motor and fine motor 
skill exercises. Coping strategies and energy conservation techniques are 
integrated to manage fatigue. The study utilizes outcome measures, including the 
Gross Motor Function Measure, Manual Ability Classification System, and 
Functional Independence Measure, to assess the impact of the intervention on the 
patient's functional abilities. Preliminary findings suggest promising 
improvements in gait, motor skills, and overall functional independence 
following the implemented physiotherapy intervention. The study underscores the 
potential effectiveness of a tailored approach rooted in neuroplasticity and 
motor learning principles for individuals with neurometabolic disorders. The 
patient-centered care model, encompassing coping strategies and energy 
conservation techniques, contributes to holistic well-being. While specific 
literature on these interventions in neurometabolic disorders is limited, the 
study provides valuable insights and calls for further research to refine and 
expand tailored therapeutic approaches in this challenging clinical context.

Networks.

This work presents a real-time gait phase estimator using thigh- and 
shank-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). A multi-rate convolutional 
neural network (CNN) was trained to estimate gait phase for a dataset of 16 
participants walking on an instrumented treadmill with speeds varying between 
0.1 to 1.9 m/s, and conditions such as asymmetric walking, stop-start, and 
sudden speed changes. One-subject-out cross-validation was used to assess the 
robustness of the estimator to the gait patterns of new individuals. The 
proposed model had a spatial root mean square error of 5.00±1.65%, and a 
temporal mean absolute error of 2.78±0.97% evaluated at the heel strike. A 
second cross-validation was performed to show that leaving out any of the 
walking conditions from the training dataset did not result in significant 
performance degradation. A 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that there 
was no significant increase in spatial or temporal error when testing on the 
abnormal walking conditions left out of the training set. The results of the two 
cross-validations demonstrate that the proposed model generalizes well across 
new participants, various walking speeds, and gait patterns, showcasing its 
potential for use in investigating patient populations with pathological gaits 
and facilitating robot-assisted walking.

Adults who have had an amputation face barriers to having an active lifestyle 
which attenuates cardiorespiratory fitness. Prior studies in amputees typically 
involve treadmill walking or arm ergometry, yet physiological responses to 
bilateral leg cycling are less understood. This study assessed the hemodynamic 
and metabolic responses to moderate and vigorous cycle ergometry in men who have 
had a transtibial amputation (TTA). Five men who had had a unilateral TTA (age = 
39 ± 15 yr) and six controls (CONs) without an amputation (age = 31 ± 11 yr) 
performed two 20 min bouts of cycling differing in intensity. Cardiac output 
(CO), stroke volume (SV), and oxygen consumption (VO2) were measured during 
moderate intensity continuous exercise (MICE) and high intensity interval 
exercise (HIIE) using thoracic impedance and indirect calorimetry. In response 
to MICE and HIIE, the HR and VO2 levels were similar (p > 0.05) between groups. 
Stroke volume and CO were higher (p < 0.05) in the CONs, which was attributed to 
their higher body mass. In men with TTAs, HIIE elicited a peak HR = 88%HRmax and 
substantial blood lactate accumulation, representing vigorous exercise 
intensity. No adverse events were exhibited in the men with TTAs. The men with 
TTAs show similar responses to MICE and HIIE versus the CONs.

The impairment of walking balance function seriously affects human health and 
will lead to a significantly increased risk of falling. It is important to 
assess and improve the walking balance of humans. However, existing evaluation 
methods for human walking balance are relatively subjective, and the selected 
metrics lack effectiveness and comprehensiveness. We present a method to 
construct a comprehensive evaluation index of human walking balance. We used it 
to generate personal and general indexes. We first pre-selected some preliminary 
metrics of walking balance based on theoretical analysis. Seven healthy subjects 
walked with exoskeleton interference on a treadmill at 1.25 m/s while their 
ground reaction force information and kinematic data were recorded. One subject 
with Charcot-Marie-Tooth walked at multiple speeds without the exoskeleton while 
the same data were collected. Then, we picked a number of effective evaluation 
metrics based on statistical analysis. We finally constructed the Walking 
Balance Index (WBI) by combining multiple metrics using principal component 
analysis. The WBI can distinguish walking balance among different subjects and 
gait conditions, which verifies the effectiveness of our method in evaluating 
human walking balance. This method can be used to evaluate and further improve 
the walking balance of humans in subsequent simulations and experiments.

BACKGROUND: Rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament is an orthopedic injury 
that results in neuromuscular impairments affecting sensory input to the central 
nervous system. Traditional physical therapy after anterior cruciate ligament 
reconstruction aims to rehabilitate orthopedic impairments but fails to address 
asymmetric gait mechanics that are present post-operatively and are linked to 
the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. A first step towards 
developing gait interventions is understanding if individuals after anterior 
cruciate ligament reconstruction have the capacity to learn new walking 
mechanics.
METHODS: The split-belt treadmill offers a task-specific approach to examine 
neuromuscular adaptations in patients after injury. The potential for changing 
spatiotemporal gait mechanics via split-belt treadmill adaptation has not been 
tested early after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; nor has the 
ability to retain and transfer newly learned gait mechanics. Therefore, we used 
a split-belt treadmill paradigm to compare gait adaptation, retention, and 
transfer to overground walking between 15 individuals 3-9 months after anterior 
cruciate ligament reconstruction and 15 matched control individuals.
FINDINGS: Results suggested individuals after anterior cruciate ligament 
reconstruction were able to adapt and retain step length symmetry changes as 
well as controls. There was also evidence of partial transfer to overground 
walking, similar to controls.
INTERPRETATION: Despite disruption in afferent feedback from the joint, 
individuals early after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction can learn a 
new gait pattern using sensorimotor adaptation, retain, and partially transfer 
the learned gait pattern. This may be a critical time to intervene with 
gait-specific interventions targeting post-operative gait asymmetries.

BACKGROUND: Relative motion between the residual limb and socket in individuals 
with transtibial limb loss can lead to substantial consequences that limit 
mobility. Although assessments of the relative motion between the residual limb 
and socket have been performed, there remains a substantial gap in understanding 
the complex mechanics of the residual limb-socket interface during dynamic 
activities that limits the ability to improve socket design. However, dynamic 
stereo x-ray (DSX) is an advanced imaging technology that can quantify 3D bone 
movement and skin deformation inside a socket during dynamic activities.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop analytical tools using DSX to quantify the 
dynamic, in vivo kinematics between the residual limb and socket and the 
mechanism of residual tissue deformation.
METHODS: A lower limb cadaver study will first be performed to optimize the 
placement of an array of radiopaque beads and markers on the socket, liner, and 
skin to simultaneously assess dynamic tibial movement and residual tissue and 
liner deformation. Five cadaver limbs will be used in an iterative process to 
develop an optimal marker setup. Stance phase gait will be simulated during each 
session to induce bone movement and skin and liner deformation. The number, 
shape, size, and placement of each marker will be evaluated after each session 
to refine the marker set. Once an optimal marker setup is identified, 21 
participants with transtibial limb loss will be fitted with a socket capable of 
being suspended via both elevated vacuum and traditional suction. Participants 
will undergo a 4-week acclimation period and then be tested in the DSX system to 
track tibial, skin, and liner motion under both suspension techniques during 3 
activities: treadmill walking at a self-selected speed, at a walking speed 10% 
faster, and during a step-down movement. The performance of the 2 suspension 
techniques will be evaluated by quantifying the 3D bone movement of the residual 
tibia with respect to the socket and quantifying liner and skin deformation at 
the socket-residuum interface.
RESULTS: This study was funded in October 2021. Cadaver testing began in January 
2023. Enrollment began in February 2024. Data collection is expected to conclude 
in December 2025. The initial dissemination of results is expected in November 
2026.
CONCLUSIONS: The successful completion of this study will help develop 
analytical methods for the accurate assessment of residual limb-socket motion. 
The results will significantly advance the understanding of the complex 
biomechanical interactions between the residual limb and the socket, which can 
aid in evidence-based clinical practice and socket prescription guidelines. This 
critical foundational information can aid in the development of future socket 
technology that has the potential to reduce secondary comorbidities that result 
from complications of poor prosthesis load transmission.

A goal of mobile monitoring is to approximate metabolic energy expenditure (EE) 
during activities of daily living and exercise. Many physical activity monitors 
are inaccurate with respect to estimated EE and differentiating between 
activities that occur over short intervals. The objective of our study was to 
assess the validity of the SenseWear Armband (SWA) compared to indirect 
calorimetry (IC) during short intervals of walking and running. Twenty young, 
fit participants walked (preferred speed) and ran (75%, 85%, and 95% of 
predicted VO2max run speeds) on a treadmill. EE estimates from IC, SWA, and 
prediction equations that used the SWA, speed, and heart rate were examined 
during each 4 min interval and across the whole protocol (Total). The level of 
significance was p < 0.05. The SWA overestimated EE relative to IC by 1.62 
kcal·min-1 while walking and 1.05 kcal·min-1 while running at 75%. However, it 
underestimated EE at the 85% (0.05 kcal·min-1) and 95% (0.92 kcal·min-1) speeds, 
but not significantly, and overestimated total EE by 28.29 kcal. Except for 
walking, our results suggest that the SWA displayed a good level of agreement 
(ICC = 0.76 to 0.84) with IC measures. Activity-specific algorithms using SWA, 
speed, and heart rate improved EE estimates, based on the standard error of the 
estimates, but perhaps not enough to justify extra sensors. The SWA may enable 
EE estimation of locomotion outside the laboratory, including those with short 
bouts of high intensity activity, but continued development of the SWA, or 
devices like it, is needed to enable accurate monitoring.

BACKGROUND: Physical decline due to aging has been associated with the risk of 
falls. Minimum toe clearance (MTC) is a gait parameter that might play a role in 
the mechanism of tripping and falling. However, it is unclear if there are any 
sex-related effects regarding MTC as people age. The present study investigated 
if there are sex-related differences in MTC in older active adults.
METHODS: Twenty-three females and 23 males (F: 65.5 ± 4.8 years; M: 61.9 ± 5.2 
years) walked on a treadmill at a preferred walking speed, while kinematic data 
were obtained at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz and up-sampled to 120 and 240 
Hz. MTC was calculated from the kinematics data and evaluated concerning its 
magnitude (ie, MTC and MTC/leg length), the time between left/right MTC (ie, 
T-MTC), amount of variability (ie, coefficient of variation [CV] and coefficient 
of variation modified [CVm]), and temporal structure of variability, that is, 
the complexity of the time series (ie, MTC α, T-MTC α).
RESULTS: No sex effects were found for MTC/leg length, for the amount of 
variability (ie, CV and CVm), and for the complexity of the time series (MTC α, 
T-MTC α). However, females exhibited significantly lower MTC and T-MTC after 
adjusting for walking speed, mass, and age as covariates.
CONCLUSIONS: The reduced MTC in females suggests a potential sex-related 
disparity in the risk of tripping and falling among active older adults.

Tactical populations face increased risk on the job, and it is known that 
firefighters have high levels of cardiac-related death. Aerobic fitness is a 
modifiable cardiac risk factor, but many fire stations lack the proper equipment 
to easily assess aerobic fitness levels of their firefighters. Additionally, 
many fire stations lack wellness programs to hold firefighters accountable for 
maintaining their fitness levels.
PURPOSE: We assessed the validity of the submaximal 6-minute walk test (6MWT) as 
a measure of aerobic capacity compared to a maximal treadmill test and the 
submaximal Gerkin protocol.
METHODS: Twenty-four firefighters (19 male, 5 female, 34.8 ± 9.7 years; 38.1 ± 
3.6 kg·m-2) completed the 6MWT, the submaximal Gerkin protocol, and a maximal 
treadmill test. Data were analyzed with Bland-Altman plots and correlation 
analysis.
RESULTS: We found equivalence between the 6MWT and directly measured VO2max and 
between the 6MWT and Gerkin protocol using Bland-Altman plots. In our cohort, 
the 6MWT underestimated VO2max (31.57 ml·kg-1·min-1) compared to directly 
measured VO2max (38.1 ml·kg-1·min-1) by 17% and to the Gerkin (40.48 
ml·kg-1·min-1) by 22%.
CONCLUSION: Considering its equivalence, using the 6MWT could be a more 
accessible way to quantify aerobic capacity in firefighters. Despite 
underestimation, having an easy to administer protocol may encourage more fire 
stations to assess pre- and post- fitness levels regularly.

For measurements of exercise intensity, an individual's oxygen uptake (V̇O2) is 
measured with an exhaled gas analyzer that involves a mask, but exercise 
coaching would benefit if an individual's V̇O2 could be estimated with more 
easily obtained predictors. We investigated the predictability of V̇O2 by 
electromyography (EMG) of the neck inspiratory muscles. We analyzed the EMG 
results of the sternocleidomastoid (EMGst) and scalene (EMGsc) muscles of 14 
healthy adults who performed a treadmill exercise load test. Their V̇O2, 
inspiratory flow rate, and heart rate were simultaneously recorded during the 
exercise. The exercise load test was performed twice at a ≥2-day interval. The 
first visit was an incremental exercise test, and the second was a repeated 
two-load exercise test at levels below and above the participant's ventilatory 
threshold (VT) as determined in the first test. We observed that the integrated 
EMG values for each exercise load showed partially significant positive 
correlations with the EMGst and EMGsc. However, the cervical inspiratory muscle 
EMGs did not show as high a correlation as the minute ventilation. These results 
indicate that (i) EMG of the cervical inspiratory muscles could be used to 
estimate V̇O2, but (ii) these EMG parameters alone should be considered 
insufficient for estimating V̇O2.

Gait impairments negatively affect the quality of life of people with 
Parkinson's disease (PwPD). Aerobic exercise (AE) is an alternative to alleviate 
these impairments and its combination with transcranial direct current 
stimulation (tDCS) has demonstrated synergistic effects. However, the effect of 
multitarget tDCS application (i.e., motor, and prefrontal cortices 
simultaneously) combined with physical exercise on gait impairments is still 
little known. Thus, the proposed randomized clinical trial will verify the acute 
effects of AE combined with tDCS applied on motor and prefrontal cortices 
separately and simultaneously on gait (spatial-temporal and cortical activity 
parameters) in PwPD. Twenty-four PwPD in Hoehn & Yahr stages I-III will be 
recruited for this crossover study. PwPD will practice AE on treadmill 
simultaneously with the application of anodal tDCS during four intervention 
sessions on different days (∼ one week of interval). Active tDCS will be applied 
to the primary motor cortex, prefrontal cortex, and both areas simultaneously 
(multitarget), with an intensity of 2 mA for 20 min. For sham, the stimulation 
will remain at 2 mA for 10 s. The AE will last a total of 30 min, consisting of 
warm-up, main part (20 min with application of tDCS), and recovery. Exercise 
intensity will be controlled by heart rate. Spatial-temporal and cortical 
activity parameters will be acquired before and after each session during 
overground walking, walking with obstacle avoidance, and walking with a 
cognitive dual task at self-preferred velocity. An accelerometer will be 
positioned on the fifth lumbar vertebra to obtain the spatial-temporal 
parameters (i.e., step length, duration, velocity, and swing phase duration). 
Prefrontal cortex activity will be recorded from a portable functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy system and oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin 
concentrations will be analyzed. Two-way ANOVAs with repeated measures for 
stimulation and moment will be performed. The findings of the study may 
contribute to improving gait in PwPD. Trial registration: Brazilian Clinical 
Trials Registry (RBR-738zkp7).

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Our aim was to characterise the in-depth metabolic response to 
aerobic exercise and the impact of residual pancreatic beta cell function in 
type 1 diabetes. We also aimed to use the metabolome to distinguish individuals 
with type 1 diabetes with reduced maximal aerobic capacity in exercise defined 
by V˙O2peak .
METHODS: Thirty participants with type 1 diabetes (≥3 years duration) and 30 
control participants were recruited. Groups did not differ in age or sex. After 
quantification of peak stimulated C-peptide, participants were categorised into 
those with undetectable (<3 pmol/l), low (3-200 pmol/l) or high (>200 pmol/l) 
residual beta cell function. Maximal aerobic capacity was assessed by V˙O2peak 
test and did not differ between control and type 1 diabetes groups. All 
participants completed 45 min of incline treadmill walking (60% V˙O2peak ) with 
venous blood taken prior to exercise, immediately post exercise and after 60 min 
recovery. Serum was analysed using targeted metabolomics. Metabolomic data were 
analysed by multivariate statistics to define the metabolic phenotype of 
exercise in type 1 diabetes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 
used to identify circulating metabolomic markers of maximal aerobic capacity ( 
V˙O2peak ) during exercise in health and type 1 diabetes.
RESULTS: Maximal aerobic capacity ( V˙O2peak ) inversely correlated with HbA1c 
in the type 1 diabetes group (r2=0.17, p=0.024). Higher resting serum 
tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites malic acid (fold change 1.4, p=0.001) and 
lactate (fold change 1.22, p=1.23×10-5) differentiated people with type 1 
diabetes. Higher serum acylcarnitines (AC) (AC C14:1, F value=12.25, p=0.001345; 
AC C12, F value=11.055, p=0.0018) were unique to the metabolic response to 
exercise in people with type 1 diabetes. C-peptide status differentially 
affected metabolic responses in serum ACs during exercise (AC C18:1, leverage 
0.066; squared prediction error 3.07). The malic acid/pyruvate ratio in rested 
serum was diagnostic for maximal aerobic capacity ( V˙O2peak ) in people with 
type 1 diabetes (ROC curve AUC 0.867 [95% CI 0.716, 0.956]).
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The serum metabolome distinguishes high and low 
maximal aerobic capacity and has diagnostic potential for facilitating 
personalised medicine approaches to manage aerobic exercise and fitness in type 
1 diabetes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Balance and walking capacity are often impaired in 
people with motor incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI), frequently resulting in 
reduced functional ambulation and participation. This study aimed to assess the 
efficacy of walking adaptability training compared to similarly dosed 
conventional locomotor and strength training for improving walking capacity, 
functional ambulation, balance confidence, and participation in ambulatory 
people with iSCI.
METHODS: We conducted a 2-center, parallel-group, pragmatic randomized 
controlled trial. Forty-one people with iSCI were randomized to 6 weeks of (i) 
walking adaptability training (11 hours of Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive 
Lab (GRAIL) training-a treadmill in a virtual reality environment) or (ii) 
conventional locomotor and strength training (11 hours of treadmill training and 
lower-body strength exercises). The primary measure of walking capacity was 
maximal walking speed, measured with an overground 2-minute walk test. Secondary 
outcome measures included the Spinal Cord Injury Functional Ambulation Profile 
(SCI-FAP), the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale, and the 
Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation (USER-P).
RESULTS: No significant difference in maximal walking speed between the walking 
adaptability (n = 17) and conventional locomotor and strength (n = 18) training 
groups was found 6 weeks after training at follow-up (-0.05 m/s; 95% 
CI = -0.12-0.03). In addition, no significant group differences in secondary 
outcomes were found. However, independent of intervention, significant 
improvements over time were found for maximal walking speed, SCI-FAP, ABC, and 
USER-P restrictions scores. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that walking 
adaptability training may not be superior to conventional locomotor and strength 
training for improving walking capacity, functional ambulation, balance 
confidence, or participation in ambulatory people with iSCI.

BACKGROUND: Low load exercise training with blood flow restriction (BFR) has 
become increasingly used by human physical therapists to prescribe controlled 
exercise following orthopaedic injury; its effects on the equine superficial 
digital flexor tendon (SDFT), however, are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate outcomes of pressure specific BFR walking exercise on 
uninjured equine SDFT biomechanics and histomorphology.
STUDY DESIGN: Controlled in vivo experiment.
METHODS: Four forelimbs of four horses were exposed to 40 BFR-walk sessions 
(10-min interval walking) on a treadmill over a 56-day study period with their 
contralateral forelimbs serving as untreated controls. Similarly, four forelimbs 
of four control horses were exposed to 40 sham cuff walk sessions. On study Day 
56, all horses (n = 8) were humanely euthanised and forelimb SDFTs underwent 
non-destructive biomechanical testing and corresponding histomorphological 
analysis. Significance in biomechanical parameters between treatment groups was 
analysed using a mixed-effects ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc tests.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in SDFT stiffness for both first 
(p = 0.02) and last cycles (p = 0.03) were appreciated within the BFR treated 
group only, with BFR exposed forelimbs being significantly stiffer than the 
contralateral unexposed forelimbs. When normalised to cross-sectional area, no 
significant differences were appreciated among treatment groups in elastic 
modulus for the first (p = 0.5) or last cycles (p = 0.4). No histological 
differences were appreciated among treatment groups according to Bonar, Movin, 
or musculotendinous junction evaluation criteria.
MAIN LIMITATIONS: Short-term comparisons were performed in a small sample 
population without correlation to performance outcome measures. Optimal 
occlusion percentages and walk protocols remain unknown.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated no negative impact of BFR on mechanical 
strength of the equine SDFT; however, evidence suggests that BFR results in 
increased tendon stiffness based on biomechanical testing and subsequent 
calculations. No consistent detrimental histomorphological changes were seen.

Publisher: CONTEXTO: Exercício de baixa carga com restrição do fluxo sanguíneo 
(RFS) tem sido cada vez mais utilizado por fisioterapeutas humanos para tratar 
lesões ortopédicas. Porém, seus efeitos no tendão flexor digital superficial 
(TFDS) de equinos não é conhecida.
OBJETIVOS: O objetivo deste estudo foi investigar o efeito de específicas 
pressões com RFS durante o passo em cavalos sem lesão no TFDS, por meio de 
histologia e análise biomecânica.
DELINEAMENTO DO ESTUDO: Estudo controlado. MÉTODOS: Quatro membros torácicos de 
quatro cavalos foram expostos a 40 sessões de RFS durante o passo (10 minutos de 
caminhada intervalada), ao longo de 56 dias. O membro contralateral foi 
utilizado como controle. Da mesma forma, quatro membros de quatro cavalos 
controle foram expostos a 40 sessões simuladas de caminhada com torniquete. No 
dia 56, todos os cavalos (n = 8) foram eutanasiados, e os TFDS foram submetidos 
a testes biomecânicos não destrutivos e análise histológica. A significância dos 
parâmetros biomecânicos entre tratamentos foi analisada utilizando ANOVA de 
efeitos mistos, seguida pelo teste de Tukey.
RESULTADOS: A rigidez do TFDS foi estatisticamente diferente nos primeiros 
(p = 0.02) e últimos (p = 0.03) ciclos no grupo submetido à RFS, sendo os 
membros tratados significativamente mais rígidos do que os membros 
contralaterais não expostos ao tratamento. Quando normalizado para a área 
transversal, não foi observada diferença significativa entre os grupos de 
tratamento no módulo de elasticidade para os primeiros (p = 0.5) e últimos 
(p = 0.4) ciclos. Não foram identificadas diferenças histológicas nos diferentes 
tipos de tratamento, de acordo com os critérios de avaliação Bonar, Movin e de 
junção musculo‐tendínea. PRINCIPAIS LIMITAÇÕES: Comparações de curto prazo foram 
realizadas em uma amostra pequena da população, sem correlação com medidas de 
resultados de desempenho. As porcentagens ideais de oclusão e os protocolos de 
caminhada permanecem desconhecidos. CONCLUSÕES: Este estudo não demonstrou 
impacto negativo do RFS na resistência mecânica do TFDS equino; no entanto, as 
evidências sugerem que a RFS resulta em aumento da rigidez do tendão com base em 
testes biomecânicos e cálculos subsequentes. Nenhuma alteração histológica 
prejudicial consistente foi observada.

Blood flow restriction (BFR) is a commonly used training modality that has been 
demonstrated to enhance muscle characteristics such as size and function. The 
purpose of this study was to determine if a 4-week walking program with or 
without BFR in healthy, active adults has an effect on body composition, 
anaerobic, and aerobic running performance. Thirty-three participants, 
randomized among three groups, completed the walking program, which included 
five sets of 2 min walking intervals with 1 min rest, with or without BFR, or 10 
min walking with BFR. Assessments completed before and after the walking program 
included body composition, 40-yard sprints, and a VO2MAX test on a treadmill. A 
two-way ANOVA revealed no changes among the groups nor for any variables at any 
time (p > 0.05). Additionally, one main effect for time indicated the VO2 at 
V-slope threshold was greater following training for all groups combined (p = 
0.001). The results demonstrate that low volume and intensity walking with BFR 
for 4 weeks did not provide a sufficient stimulus for changing body composition 
or performance metrics in a group of very active adults. Longer or more isolated 
exposure of BFR on the limbs may contribute to more pronounced adaptations.

BACKGROUND: Field-based walk tests conducted remotely may provide an alternative 
method to a facility-based assessment of exercise capacity for people with 
advanced lung disease. This prospective study evaluated the level of agreement 
in the distance walked between a 6-min walk test (6MWT) and an incremental 
shuttle walk test performed by using standard in-person procedures and test 
variations and settings.
METHODS: Adults with advanced lung disease underwent 4 study visits: (i) one 
in-person standard 6MWT (30-m corridor) and one in-person treadmill 6MWT, (ii) a 
remote 6MWT in a home setting (10-m corridor), (iii) 2 in-person standard 
incremental shuttle walk tests (10-m corridor), and (iv) a remote incremental 
shuttle walk test in a home setting (10-m corridor). A medical-grade oximeter 
measured heart rate and oxygen saturation before, during, and for 2 min after 
the tests.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants were included (23 men [82%]; 64 (57-67) y 
old; 19 with interstitial lung disease [68%] and 9 with COPD [32%]; and 26 used 
supplemental oxygen (93%) [exertional [Formula: see text] of 0.46 ± 0.1]). There 
was no agreement between the tests. Greater walking distances were achieved with 
standard testing procedures: in-person 6MWT versus treadmill 6MWT (355 ± 68 vs 
296 ± 97; P = .001; n = 28), in-person 6MWT versus remote 6MWT (349 ± 68 vs 293 
± 84; P = .001; n = 24), and in-person incremental shuttle walk test versus 
remote incremental shuttle walk test (216 ± 62 vs 195 ± 63; P = .03; n = 22).
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the distance walked may have resulted from different 
track lengths, widths, and walking surfaces. This should be considered in test 
interpretation if tests are repeated under different conditions.

The effects of a 12-week gait retraining program on the adaptation of the medial 
gastrocnemius (MG) and muscle-tendon unit (MTU) were investigated. 26 runners 
with a rearfoot strike pattern (RFS) were randomly assigned to one of two 
groups: gait retraining (GR) or control group (CON). MG ultrasound images, 
marker positions, and ground reaction forces (GRF) were collected twice during 
9 km/h of treadmill running before and after the intervention. Ankle kinetics 
and the MG and MTU behavior and dynamics were quantified. Runners in the GR 
performed gradual 12-week gait retraining transitioning to a forefoot strike 
pattern. After 12-week, (1) ten participants in each group completed the 
training; eight participants in GR transitioned to non-RFS with reduced foot 
strike angles; (2) MG fascicle contraction length and velocity significantly 
decreased after the intervention for both groups, whereas MG forces increased 
after intervention for both groups; (3) significant increases in MTU stretching 
length for GR and peak MTU recoiling velocity for both groups were observed 
after the intervention, respectively; (4) no significant difference was found 
for all parameters of the series elastic element. Gait retraining might 
potentially influence the MG to operate at lower fascicle contraction lengths 
and velocities and produce greater peak forces. The gait retraining had no 
effect on SEE behavior and dynamics but did impact MTU, suggesting that the 
training was insufficient to induce mechanical loading changes on SEE behavior 
and dynamics.

Restoration of blood flow in skeletal muscle after a prolonged period of 
ischemia induces muscular ischemia-reperfusion injury, leading to local 
injury/dysfunction in muscles followed by systemic inflammatory responses. 
However, preventive/curative agents for skeletal muscle ischemia injury are 
unavailable in clinics to date. Increasing evidence has validated that carbon 
monoxide (CO) prevents the progression of ischemia-reperfusion injury in various 
organs owing to its versatile bioactivity. Previously, we developed a 
bioinspired CO donor, CO-bound red blood cells (CO-RBC), which mimics the 
dynamics of RBC-associated CO in the body. In the present study, we have tested 
the therapeutic potential of CO-RBC in muscular injury/dysfunction and secondary 
systemic inflammation induced by skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion. The 
results indicate that CO-RBC rather than RBC alone suppressed elevation of 
plasma creatine phosphokinase, a marker of muscular injury, in rats subjected to 
both hind limbs ischemia-reperfusion. In addition, the results of the treadmill 
walking test revealed a significantly decreased muscular motor function in 
RBC-treated rats subjected to both hind limbs ischemia-reperfusion than that in 
healthy rats, however, CO-RBC treatment facilitated sustained muscular motor 
functions after hind limbs ischemia-reperfusion. Furthermore, CO-RBC rather than 
RBC suppressed the production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin 
(IL)-6, which were upregulated by muscular ischemia-reperfusion. Interestingly, 
CO-RBC treatment induced higher levels of IL-10 compared to saline or RBC 
treatments. Based on these findings, we suggest that CO-RBC exhibits a 
suppressive effect against skeletal muscle injury/dysfunction and systemic 
inflammatory responses after skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion.

INTRODUCTION: With increasing life expectancy of older adult population, 
maintaining independence and well-being in later years is of paramount 
importance. This study aims to investigate the impact of three distinct 
interventions: cognitive training, resistance training and a combination of 
both, compared with an inactive control group, on cognitive performance, 
mobility and quality of life in adults aged ≥65 years.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This trial will investigate healthy older adults aged ≥65 
years living independently without cognitive impairments. Participants will be 
randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) cognitive training, (2) resistance 
training, (3) combined cognitive and resistance training, and (4) control group 
(n=136 participants with 34 participants per group). The interventions will be 
conducted over 12 weeks. The cognitive training group will receive group-based 
activities for 45-60 min two times a week. The resistance training group 
exercises will target six muscle groups and the combined group will integrate 
cognitive tasks into the resistance training sessions. Primary outcomes are: 
Short Physical Performance Battery, Sit-to-Stand Test, Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment, Trail Making Test and Stroop Test combined with gait on a treadmill 
(dual task). Life satisfaction will be measured by the Satisfaction With Life 
Scale. Secondary outcomes encompass hand grip strength and the Functional 
Independence Measure.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was provided by the local Ethics 
Committee at the University of Hamburg (no. 2023_009). Informed consent will be 
obtained from all study participants. The results of the study will be 
distributed for review and discussion in academic journals and conferences.

OBJECTIVE: Exercise remains a hallmark treatment for post-traumatic 
osteoarthritis (PTOA) and may maintain joint homeostasis in part by clearing 
inflammatory cytokines, cells, and particles. It remains largely unknown whether 
exercise-induced joint clearance can provide therapeutic relief of PTOA. In this 
study, we hypothesized that exercise could slow the progression of preclinical 
PTOA in part by enhancing knee joint clearance.
DESIGN: Surgical medial meniscal transection was used to induce PTOA in 
3-month-old male Lewis rats. A sham surgery was used as a control. Mild 
treadmill walking was introduced 3 weeks post-surgery and maintained to 6 weeks 
post-surgery. Gait and isometric muscle torque were measured at the study 
endpoint. Near-infrared imaging tracked how exercise altered lymphatic and 
venous knee joint clearance during discrete time points of PTOA progression.
RESULTS: Exercise mitigated joint degradation associated with PTOA by preserving 
glycosaminoglycan content and reducing osteophyte volume (effect size (95% 
Confidence Interval (CI)); 1.74 (0.71-2.26)). PTOA increased hind step widths 
(0.57 (0.18-0.95) cm), but exercise corrected this gait dysfunction (0.54 
(0.16-0.93) cm), potentially indicating pain relief. Venous, but not lymphatic, 
clearance was quicker 1-, 3-, and 6-weeks post-surgery compared to baseline. The 
mild treadmill walking protocol expedited lymphatic clearance rate in moderate 
PTOA (3.39 (0.20-6.59) hrs), suggesting exercise may play a critical role in 
restoring joint homeostasis.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that mild exercise has the potential to slow disease 
progression in part by expediting joint clearance in moderate PTOA.

BACKGROUND: The nonlinear variability present during steady-state gait may 
provide a signature of health and showcase one's walking adaptability. Although 
treadmills can capture vast amounts of walking data required for estimating 
variability within a small space, gait patterns may be misrepresented compared 
to an overground setting. Smartphones may provide a low-cost and user-friendly 
estimate of gait patterns among a variety of walking settings. However, no study 
has investigated differences in gait patterns derived from a smartphone between 
treadmill walking (TW) and overground walking (OW).
RESEARCH QUESTION: This study implemented a smartphone accelerometer to compare 
differences in temporal gait variability and gait dynamics between TW and OW.
METHODS: Sixteen healthy adults (8F; 24.7 ± 3.8 years) visited the laboratory on 
three separate days and completed three 8-minute OW and three TW trials, at 
their preferred speed, during each visit. The inter-stride interval was 
calculated as the time difference between right heel contact events located 
within the vertical accelerometery signals recorded from a smartphone while 
placed in participants front right pant pocket during walking trials. The 
inter-stride interval series was used to calculate stride time standard 
deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (COV), statistical persistence 
(fractal scaling index), and statistical regularity (sample entropy). Two-way 
analysis of variance compared walking condition and laboratory visits for each 
measure.
RESULTS: Compared to TW, OW displayed significantly (p < 0.01) greater stride 
time SD (0.014 s, 0.020 s), COV (1.26 %, 1.82 %), fractal scaling index (0.70, 
0.79) and sample entropy (1.43, 1.63). No differences were found between visits 
for all measures.
SIGNIFICANCE: Smartphone-based assessment of gait provides the ability to 
distinguish between OW and TW conditions, similar to previously established 
methodologies. Furthermore, smartphones may be a low-cost and user-friendly tool 
to estimate gait patterns outside the laboratory to improve ecological validity, 
with implications for free-living monitoring of gait among various populations.

Outdoor gait-training has been successful in improving pain and reducing contact 
time during outdoor running for runners with exercise-related lower leg pain 
(ERLLP). However, it is unclear if these adaptations translate to gold standard 
treadmill running and clinical strength assessments. The study purpose was to 
assess the influence of a 4-week outdoor gait-training intervention with home 
exercises (FBHE) on treadmill running biomechanics and lower extremity strength 
compared to home exercises alone (HE) among runners with ERLLP. Seventeen 
runners with ERLLP were randomly allocated to FBHE and HE groups (FBHE: 3 M, 6F, 
23 ± 4 years, 22.0 ± 4.6 kg/m2; HE: 3 M, 5F, 25 ± 5 years, 24.0 ± 4.0 kg/m2). 
Both groups completed eight sessions of home exercises over 4 weeks. The FBHE 
group received gait-training through wearable sensors to reduce contact time. 
Treadmill running gait and clinical strength assessments were conducted at 
baseline and 4-weeks. Multivariate repeated measures analyses of variance were 
used to assess the influence of group and timepoint for all outcomes. The FBHE 
group demonstrated significantly decreased contact time at 4-weeks compared to 
baseline and the HE group (Mean Difference [MD] range: -42 ms - -39 ms; p-range: 
<0.001-0.02). The FBHE group had significantly increased cadence (MD: +21 
steps/min; p = 0.003) and decreased loading impulse (MD: -51, p < 0.001) during 
treadmill running at 4-weeks compared to the HE group. Strength did not 
significantly differ adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.007). The outdoor 
FBHE intervention transferred to favorable changes in treadmill running 
biomechanics. Clinicians treating runners with ERLLP patients should implement 
data-driven outdoor gait-training to maximize patient benefits across running 
locations.

BACKGROUND: The ability to relearn a lost skill is critical to motor recovery 
after a stroke. Previous studies indicate that stroke typically affects the 
processes underlying motor control and execution but not the learning of those 
skills. However, these prior studies could have been confounded by the presence 
of significant motor impairments and/or have not focused on motor acuity tasks 
(i.e., tasks focusing on the quality of executed actions) that have direct 
functional relevance to rehabilitation.
METHODS: Twenty-five participants (10 stroke; 15 controls) were recruited for 
this prospective, case-control study. Participants learned a novel 
foot-trajectory tracking task on two consecutive days while walking on a 
treadmill. On day 1, participants learned a new gait pattern by performing a 
task that necessitated greater hip and knee flexion during the swing phase of 
the gait. On day 2, participants repeated the task with their training leg to 
test retention. An average tracking error was computed to determine online and 
offline learning and was compared between stroke survivors and uninjured 
controls.
RESULTS: Stroke survivors were able to improve their tracking performance on the 
first day (p=0.033); however, the amount of learning in stroke survivors was 
lower in comparison with the control group on both days (p≤0.05). Interestingly, 
the offline gains in motor learning were higher in stroke survivors when 
compared with uninjured controls (p=0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that even high-functioning stroke survivors may 
have difficulty acquiring new motor skills related to walking, which may be 
related to the underlying neural damage caused at the time of stroke. 
Furthermore, it is likely that stroke survivors may require longer training with 
adequate rest to acquire new motor skills, and rehabilitation programs should 
target motor skill learning to improve outcomes after stroke.

BACKGROUND: Spinometry is a radiation-free method to three-dimensional spine 
imaging that provides additional information about the functional gait patterns 
related to the pelvis and lower extremities. This radiation-free technology uses 
the surface topography of the trunk to analyze surface asymmetry and identify 
bony landmarks, thereby aiding the assessment of spinal deformity and supporting 
long-term treatment regimes. Especially reliable dynamic spinometric data for 
spine and pelvis are necessary to evaluate the management of non-specific back 
pain.
RESEARCH AIM: This study aims to generate reliable dynamic spinometric data for 
spine and pelvis parameters that can serve as reference data for future studies 
and clinical practice.
METHODS: This study assessed 366 subjects (185 females) under static and 360 
subjects (181 females) under dynamic (walking on a treadmill at 3 km/h and 
5 km/h) conditions. The DIERS Formetric 4Dmotion® system uses stripes of light 
to detect the surface topography of the spine and pelvis and identifies specific 
landmarks to analyze the spine during standing and walking.
RESULTS: Relevant gender effects were calculated for lordotic angle (ηp2 = 0.22) 
and pelvic inclination (ηp2 = 0.26). Under static conditions, female subjects 
showed larger values for both parameters (lordotic angle: 41.6 ± 8.60°; pelvic 
inclination: 25.5 ± 7.49°). Regarding speed effects, three relevant changes were 
observed (sagittal imbalance: ηp2 = 0.74, kyphotic angle: ηp2 = 0.13, apical 
deviation: ηp2 = 0.11). The most considerable changes were observed between 
static condition and 3 km/h, especially for sagittal imbalance and lordotic 
angle. For these parameters, relevant effect sizes (d > 0.8) were calculated 
between static and 3 km/h for males and females. Concerning clinical vertebral 
parameters, only lordotic angle and pelvic inclination were correlated with each 
other (r = 0.722).
CONCLUSION: This study generated a gender-specific reference database of 
asymptomatic individuals for static and dynamic spinometry. It demonstrated that 
the DIERS Formetric 4Dmotion® system could capture natural changes in static and 
dynamic situations and catalogue functional adaptations of spino-pelvic statics 
at different speeds. The lordotic angle is an indirect marker of pelvic 
inclination, allowing spinometry to identify individuals at risk even under 
dynamic conditions.

Aerobic exercise reduces circulating ionized Ca (iCa) and increases parathyroid 
hormone (PTH), but the cause and consequences on Ca handling are unknown. The 
objective of this study was to determine the effects of strenuous exercise on Ca 
kinetics using dual stable Ca isotopes. Twenty-one healthy women (26.4 ± 6.7 yr) 
completed a randomized, crossover study entailing two 6-d iterations consisting 
of either 60 min of treadmill walking at 65% VO2max wearing a vest weighing 30% 
body weight on study days 1, 3, and 5 (exercise [EX]), or a rest iteration (rest 
[REST]). On day 1, participants received intravenous 42Ca and oral 44Ca. Isotope 
ratios were determined by thermal ionization mass spectrometry. Kinetic modeling 
determined fractional Ca absorption (FCA), Ca deposition (Vo+), resorption (Vo-) 
from bone, and balance (Vbal). Circulating PTH and iCa were measured before, 
during, and after each exercise/rest session. Data were analyzed by paired 
t-test or linear mixed models using SPSS. iCa decreased and PTH increased 
(P < .001) during each EX session and were unchanged during REST. On day 1, 
urinary Ca was lower in the EX pool (25 ± 11 mg) compared to REST (38 ± 16 mg, 
P = .001), but did not differ over the full 24-h collection (P > .05). FCA was 
greater during EX (26.6 ± 8.1%) compared to REST (23.9 ± 8.3%, P < .05). Vbal 
was less negative during EX (-61.3 ± 111 mg) vs REST (-108 ± 23.5 mg, P < .05), 
but VO+ (574 ± 241 vs 583 ± 260 mg) and VO- (-636 ± 243 vs -692 ± 252 mg) were 
not different (P > .05). The rapid reduction in circulating iCa may be due to a 
change in the miscible Ca pool, resulting in increased PTH and changes in 
intestinal absorption and renal Ca handling that support a more positive Ca 
balance.

INTRODUCTION: Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) often present with altered 
motor control. This can be assessed selectively during sitting/lying with the 
Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity (SCALE), or dynamically with 
the dynamic motor control index during walking (walk-DMC). Both approaches 
suggest that altered selective motor control relate to larger gait deviations.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the walk-DMC provide valuable information in addition to 
the SCALE for estimating gait deviations in individuals with CP.
METHODS: Retrospective, treadmill-based gait analysis data of 157 children with 
spastic CP (mean 11.4±3.5 years) and Gross Motor Function Classification System 
levels I (n=45), II (n=88) or III (n=24) were extracted. Gait kinematic 
deviations were evaluated using the Gait Profile Score (GPS). The SCALE, 
walk-DMC and GPS were extracted for the more clinically involved leg 
(unilateral-analysis), and for both legs together (bilateral-analysis).
RESULTS: GPS moderately correlated with both SCALE and walk-DMC scores, 
unilaterally and bilaterally (r≥0.4; p<0.001). Multivariate linear regression 
analyses were conducted, taking into account potential confounding factors. In 
the unilateral analysis, 54% of the GPS variance was explained (p<0.001), with 
both walk-DMC and SCALE significantly contributing to the GPS variance (p=0.006 
and p=0.008, respectively). In the bilateral analysis, 61% of the GPS variance 
was explained (p<0.001), with both walk-DMC and SCALE significantly contributing 
to the GPS variance (p=0.006 and p<0.001, respectively). Dimensionless walking 
speed and use of assistive devices were the only confounding factors included in 
each analysis.
SIGNIFICANCE: Both SCALE and walk-DMC significantly contribute to GPS variance, 
suggesting that they likely measure different components of motor control, and 
both may be useful in understanding the underlying relationship between motor 
control and deviations in gait kinematics.

OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical measures between patients with chronic exertional 
compartment syndrome (CECS) and healthy controls and evaluate running 
biomechanics, physical measurements, and exertional intracompartmental (ICP) 
changes in adolescent athletes with lower leg CECS.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional case-control study.
SETTING: Large tertiary care hospital and affiliated injury prevention center.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine adolescents with CECS (39 F, 10 M; age: 16.9 ± 0.8 
years; body mass index (BMI): 23.1 ± 2.9 kg/m 2 ; symptom duration: 8 ± 12 
months) were compared with 49 healthy controls (39 F, 10 M; age: 6.9 ± 0.8 
years; BMI: 20.4 ± 3.7 kg/m 2 ).
INTERVENTIONS: All participants underwent gait analyses on a force plate 
treadmill and clinical lower extremity strength and range of motion testing. 
Patients with chronic exertional compartment syndrome underwent Stryker monitor 
ICP testing.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms, menstrual history, and ICP pressures of the 
patients with CECS using descriptive statistics. Mann-Whitney U and χ 2 analyses 
were used to compare CECS with healthy patients for demographics, clinical 
measures, and gait biomechanics continuous and categorical outcomes, 
respectively. For patients with CECS, multiple linear regressions analyses were 
used to assess associations between gait biomechanics, lower extremity strength 
and range of motion, and with ICP measures.
RESULTS: The CECS group demonstrated higher mass-normalized peak ground reaction 
force measures (xBW) compared with controls (0.21 ± 0.05 xBW ( P < 0.001) and 
were more likely to have impact peak at initial contact ( P = 0.04). Menstrual 
dysfunction was independently associated with higher postexertion ICP (ß = 14.6; 
P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The CECS group demonstrated increased total force magnitude and 
vertical impact transient peaks. In women with CECS, menstrual dysfunction was 
independently associated with increased postexertion ICP. These biomechanical 
and physiological attributes may play a role in the development of CECS.

Falls among older adults are a costly public health concern. Such falls can be 
precipitated by balance disturbances, after which a recovery strategy requiring 
rapid, high force outputs is necessary. Sarcopenia among older adults likely 
diminishes their ability to produce the forces necessary to arrest gait 
instability. Age-related changes to tendon stiffness may also delay muscle 
stretch and afferent feedback and decrease force transmission, worsening fall 
outcomes. However, the association between muscle strength, tendon stiffness, 
and gait instability is not well established. Given the ankle's proximity to the 
onset of many walking balance disturbances, we examined the relation between 
both plantarflexor strength and Achilles tendon stiffness with walking-related 
instability during perturbed gait in older and younger adults-the latter 
quantified herein using margins of stability and whole-body angular momentum 
including the application of treadmill-induced slip perturbations. Older and 
younger adults did not differ in plantarflexor strength, but Achilles tendon 
stiffness was lower in older adults. Among older adults, plantarflexor weakness 
associated with greater whole-body angular momentum following treadmill-induced 
slip perturbations. Weaker older adults also appeared to walk and recover from 
treadmill-induced slip perturbations with more caution. This study highlights 
the role of plantarflexor strength and Achilles tendon stiffness in regulating 
lateral gait stability in older adults, which may be targets for training 
protocols seeking to minimize fall risk and injury severity.

BACKGROUND: Spatio-temporal running parameters and their variability help to 
determine a runner's running style. However, determining whether a change is due 
to the measurement or to a specific condition such as an injury is a matter of 
debate, as no recommendation on the number of steps required to obtain reliable 
assessments exists.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the optimal number of steps required to measure 
different spatio-temporal parameters and study their variability at different 
running speeds?
METHODS: Twenty-five runners performed three experimental sessions of three 
bouts of treadmill running at 8, 10 and 12 km/h separated by 24 h. We measured 
cadence, stride, step, contact and flight time. We calculated the duty factor 
and the leg stiffness index (Kleg). Mean spatio-temporal parameters and linear 
(coefficient of variation, standard deviation) and non-linear (Higuchi fractal 
index, α1 coefficient of detrended fluctuation analysis) analyses were computed 
for different numbers of steps. Relative reliability was determined using the 
intraclass coefficient correlation. The minimal number of steps which present a 
good reliability level was considered as the optimal number of steps for 
measurement. Absolute reliability was assessed by calculating minimal detectable 
change.
RESULTS: To assess the mean values of spatio-temporal running parameters, 
between 16 and 150 steps were required. We were unable to obtain an optimal 
number of steps for cadence, stride and step-time variabilities for all speeds. 
For the linear analyses, we deduced the optimal number of steps for Kleg and the 
contact time (around 350 steps). Non-linear analyses measurements required 
between 350 and 540 steps, depending on the parameter.
SIGNIFICANCE: Researchers and clinicians should optimize experimental conditions 
(number of steps and running speed) depending on the parameter or the 
variability analysis targeted. Future studies must use absolute reliability 
metrics to report changes in response to a specific condition with no bias due 
to measurement error.

BACKGROUND: Maximal treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise testing is the gold 
standard for assessing functional capacity in patients with idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF).
PURPOSE: Primarily to investigate the concurrent validity between three field 
tests and cardiopulmonary exercise testing in these patients.
METHODS: Patients performed the cardiopulmonary exercise testing, a six-minute 
walk test, an incremental shuttle walk test, and, the Glittre-ADL test. For 
cardiopulmonary exercise testing, the ten seconds with the higher average of the 
peak oxygen uptake obtained within the last 30 seconds were considered; for 
six-minute walk test and incremental shuttle walk test, the longer distance; and 
for the Glittre-ADL test, the shorter time spent. Concurrent validity was 
assessed using different regression models based on the best adjustment of the 
data.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with IPF were assessed, aged: 68 ± 8.1 years, 13 
male. Patients presented a peak oxygen uptake of 16.5 ± 3.6 mL.kg-1.min1, 
achieving a distance of 512.6 ± 102.8 meters in the six-minute walk test and 
415.7 ± 125.1 meters in incremental shuttle walk test. The walking distance in 
the six-minute walk test and the incremental shuttle walk test explained, 
respectively, 64% and 56% peak oxygen uptake variance observed in the 
cardiopulmonary exercise testing (R2 = 0.64,p < .001; R2 = 0.56,p < .001). The 
time spent in the Glittre-ADL test was 233.4 ± 88.7 seconds and explained 47% of 
the peak oxygen uptake variance observed in cardiopulmonary exercise testing 
(R2 = 0.47,p = .001).
CONCLUSION: The six-minute walk test, incremental shuttle walk test, and 
Glittre-ADL test were considered valid tests to explain the peak oxygen uptake 
variance obtained by the cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with IPF.

Stroke is the leading long-term disability and causes a significant financial 
burden associated with rehabilitation. In poststroke rehabilitation, individuals 
with hemiparesis have a specialized demand for coordinated movement between the 
paretic and the nonparetic legs. The split-belt treadmill can effectively 
facilitate the paretic leg by slowing down the belt speed for that leg while the 
patient is walking on a split-belt treadmill. Although studies have found that 
split-belt treadmills can produce better gait recovery outcomes than traditional 
single-belt treadmills, the high cost of split-belt treadmills is a significant 
barrier to stroke rehabilitation in clinics. In this article, we design an 
AI-based system for the single-belt treadmill to make it act like a split-belt 
by adjusting the belt speed instantaneously according to the patient's microgait 
phases. This system only requires a low-cost RGB camera to capture human gait 
patterns. A novel microgait classification pipeline model is used to detect gait 
phases in real time. The pipeline is based on self-supervised learning that can 
calibrate the anchor video with the real-time video. We then use a ResNet-LSTM 
module to handle temporal information and increase accuracy. A real-time 
filtering algorithm is used to smoothen the treadmill control. We have tested 
the developed system with 34 healthy individuals and four stroke patients. The 
results show that our system is able to detect the gait microphase accurately 
and requires less human annotation in training, compared to the ResNet50 
classifier. Our system ""Splicer"" is boosted by AI modules and performs 
comparably as a split-belt system, in terms of timely varying left/right foot 
speed, creating a hemiparetic gait in healthy individuals, and promoting paretic 
side symmetry in force exertion for stroke patients. This innovative design can 
potentially provide cost-effective rehabilitation treatment for hemiparetic 
patients.

Thickness in Those with ACL Reconstruction.

Lexington, KY.

PURPOSE: High body mass index (BMI) is a strong predictor of posttraumatic 
osteoarthritis (OA) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). 
Altered gait mechanics are independently affected by BMI and ACLR, and influence 
OA risk. Yet, evidence directly assessing the impact of high BMI on gait or 
cartilage characteristics after ACLR are limited. Here, we evaluated if high BMI 
moderates associations between gait and trochlear cartilage structure in 
individuals with ACLR.
METHODS: Treadmill walking biomechanics were evaluated in 40 normal BMI and 24 
high BMI participants with ACLR at self-selected speeds. Normalized and absolute 
peak and cumulative loads (i.e., impulse) were extracted for peak knee flexion 
and adduction moments (KFM, KAM) and vertical ground reaction force (GRF). 
Medial and lateral femoral cartilage thickness and medial/lateral thickness 
ratios were assessed via ultrasound.
RESULTS: Those with ACLR and high BMI walked with reduced normalized peak 
vertical GRFs, and greater absolute peak and cumulative loads compared with 
normal BMI individuals with ACLR. Those with ACLR and high BMI also exhibited 
thinner cartilage and greater medial/lateral ratios in ACLR limbs compared with 
contralateral limbs whereas normal BMI individuals with ACLR exhibited thicker 
ACLR limb cartilage. Lastly, greater peak KAM and KAM cumulative load were 
associated with thicker lateral cartilage and lesser medial/lateral thickness 
ratios, but only in the high BMI group.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed those with high BMI after ACLR exhibited trochlear 
cartilage structural alterations not observed in normal BMI patients, whereas 
differential associations between loading outcomes and cartilage thickness in 
ACLR knees were observed between groups. Those with high BMI after ACLR may 
require different therapeutic strategies to optimize joint health in this subset 
of patients.

Accurate measurements of hip joint kinematics are essential for improving our 
understanding of the effects of injury, disease, and surgical intervention on 
long-term hip joint health. This study assessed the accuracy of conventional 
motion capture (MoCap) for measuring hip joint center (HJC) location and hip 
joint angles during gait, squat, and step-up activities while using dynamic 
biplane radiography (DBR) as the reference standard. Twenty-four young adults 
performed six trials of treadmill walking, six body-weight squats, and six 
step-ups within a biplane radiography system. Synchronized biplane radiographs 
were collected at 50 images per second and MoCap was collected simultaneously at 
100 images per second. Bone motion during each activity was determined by 
matching digitally reconstructed radiographs, created from subject-specific 
CT-based bone models, to the biplane radiographs using a validated registration 
process. Errors in estimating HJC location and hip angles using MoCap were 
quantified by the root mean squared error (RMSE) across all frames of available 
data. The MoCap error in estimating HJC location was larger during step-up (up 
to 89.3 mm) than during gait (up to 16.6 mm) or squat (up to 31.4 mm) in all 
three anatomic directions (all p < 0.001). RMSE in hip joint flexion (7.2°) and 
abduction (4.3°) during gait was less than during squat (23.8° and 8.9°) and 
step-up (20.1° and 10.6°) (all p < 0.01). Clinical analysis and computational 
models that rely on skin-mounted markers to estimate hip kinematics should be 
interpreted with caution, especially during activities that involve deeper hip 
flexion.

Persons with Parkinson's disease experience gait alterations, such as reduced 
step length. Gait dysfunction is a significant research priority as the current 
treatments targeting gait impairment are limited. This study aimed to 
investigate the effects of visual biofeedback on propulsive force during 
treadmill walking in persons with Parkinson's. Sixteen ambulatory persons with 
Parkinson's participated in the study. They received real-time biofeedback of 
anterior ground reaction force during treadmill walking at a constant speed. 
Peak propulsive force values were measured and normalized to body weight. 
Spatiotemporal parameters were also assessed, including stride length and double 
support percent. Persons with Parkinson's significantly increased peak 
propulsive force during biofeedback compared to baseline (p <.0001, Cohen's 
dz = 1.69). Variability in peak anterior ground reaction force decreased across 
repeated trials (p <.0001, dz = 1.51). While spatiotemporal parameters did not 
show significant changes individually, stride length and double support percent 
improved marginally during biofeedback trials. Persons with Parkinson's can 
increase propulsive force with visual biofeedback, suggesting the presence of a 
propulsive reserve. Though stride length did not significantly change, 
clinically meaningful improvements were observed. Targeting push-off force 
through visual biofeedback may offer a potential rehabilitation technique to 
enhance gait performance in Persons with Parkinson's. Future studies could 
explore the long-term efficacy of this intervention and investigate additional 
strategies to improve gait in Parkinson's disease.

PURPOSE: Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) measured by peak oxygen consumption 
(V̇O 2peak ) declines with aging and correlates with mortality and morbidity. 
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is the criterion method to assess CRF, 
but its feasibility, validity, and reliability in older adults are unclear. Our 
objective was to design and implement a dependable, safe, and reliable CPET 
protocol in older adults.
METHODS: V̇O 2peak was measured by CPET, performed using treadmill exercise in 
875 adults ≥70 yr in the Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA). The 
protocol included a symptom-limited peak (maximal) exercise and two submaximal 
walking speeds. An adjudication process was in place to review tests for 
validity if they met any prespecified criteria (V̇O 2peak <12.0 mL·kg -1 ·min -1 
; maximum heart rate <100 bpm; respiratory exchange ratio <1.05 and a rating of 
perceived exertion <15). A subset ( N = 30) performed a repeat test to assess 
reproducibility.
RESULTS: CPET was safe and well tolerated, with 95.8% of participants able to 
complete the V̇O 2peak phase of the protocol. Only 56 (6.4%) participants had a 
risk alert and only two adverse events occurred: a fall and atrial fibrillation. 
Mean ± SD V̇O 2peak was 20.2 ± 4.8 mL·kg -1 ·min -1 , peak heart rate 142 ± 18 
bpm, and peak respiratory exchange ratio 1.14 ± 0.09. Adjudication was indicated 
in 47 tests; 20 were evaluated as valid and 27 as invalid (18 data collection 
errors, 9 did not reach V̇O 2peak ). Reproducibility of V̇O 2peak was high 
(intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: CPET was feasible, effective, and safe for older adults, including 
many with multimorbidity or frailty. These data support a broader implementation 
of CPET to provide insight into the role of CRF and its underlying determinants 
of aging and age-related conditions.

OBJECTIVE: Aim: To study the results of the quality of life, the state of 
vestibular disorders and the nature of walking of amateur athletes with the 
consequences of a combat craniocerebral injury after rehabilitation treatment 
according to a correctional program.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on the 
basis of the Ukrainian Scientific Research Institute of Prosthetics in Kharkov. 
Under observation were 38 men aged 25-42 years with long-term consequences of a 
closed craniocerebral injury in the late long-term period. In all patients, 
complications after TBI were persistent headache, decreased muscle strength in 
the lower extremities, impaired coordination and balance, and walking patterns. 
All patients were involved in amateur sports before injury. The following 
research methods were used during the examination: visual analogue pain scale 
(VAS), Lovett manual muscle test, Bohannon test, ≪Timed Up and Go test≫.
RESULTS: Results: All patients were randomly divided into two groups. Patients 
Gr.1 (n=20) were trained according to the developed program, which included 
training according to the PNF method, kinesiotherapy, classes on the C-mill 
sensory treadmill and the Hunova computer device, segmental reflex massage. 
Patients Gr. 2 (n=18) underwent a course of physical rehabilitation according to 
the generally accepted methodology of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine. After 
working with patients according to the developed correction and rehabilitation 
program, the following dynamics were observed: the quality of life on the VAS 
scale in Gr.1 patients had a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) 
compared to the primary indicator. The dynamics of the Lovett manual muscle test 
indicated an increase in the muscle strength of the extensor and flexor muscle 
groups of the lower extremities, the dynamics of the balance indicator in the 
standing position behind Bohann in all Gr.1 patients and acquired statistical 
significance (p<0,05). According to the test ""Timed Up and Go"" patients Gr.1 
approached the standard value (p<0,05). In all patients of Gr. 2, the studied 
characteristics had a positive trend (p>0,05).
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Individual selection of physical exercises, development 
of correctional and rehabilitation programs, multidisciplinary approach has a 
positive impact on changes in the functional state of amateur athletes, quality 
of life and contributes to the return to an active social life.

Given the known deficits in spatiotemporal aspects of gait for people with 
Parkinson's disease (PD), we sought to determine the underlying gait 
abnormalities in limb and joint kinetics, and examine how deficits in push-off 
and leg swing might contribute to the shortened step lengths for people with PD. 
Ten participants with PD and 11 age-matched control participants walked 
overground and on an instrumented treadmill. Participants with PD then walked on 
the treadmill with a posteriorly directed restraining force applied to 1) the 
pelvis to challenge push-off and 2) the ankles to challenge leg swing. 
Spatiotemporal, kinematic, and force data were collected and compared between 
groups and conditions. Despite group differences in spatiotemporal measures 
during overground walking, we did not observe these differences when the groups 
walked on a treadmill at comparable speeds. Nevertheless, the hip extension 
impulse appeared smaller in the PD group during their typical walking. When 
challenging limb propulsion, participants in the PD group maintained step 
lengths by increasing the propulsive impulse. Participants with PD were also 
able to maintain their typical step length against resistance intended to impede 
swing limb advancement, and even increased step lengths with cuing. The presence 
of reduced hip extension torque might be an early indicator of gait 
deterioration in this neurodegenerative disease. Our participants with PD were 
able to increase hip extension torque in response to needed demands. 
Additionally, participants with PD were able to increase limb propulsion and leg 
swing against resistance, suggesting a reserve in limb mechanics.

PURPOSE: To determine the effect of taurine supplementation on sweating and core 
temperature responses, including the transition from compensable to 
uncompensable heat stress, during prolonged low-intensity exercise of a 
fixed-heat production (~ 200W/m2) in hot conditions (37.5 °C), at both fixed and 
incremental vapour-pressure.
METHODS: Fifteen females (n = 3) and males (n = 12; 27 ± 5 years, 78 ± 9 kg, V˙ 
O2max 50.3 ± 7.8 mL/kg/min), completed a treadmill walking protocol (~ 200W/m2 
heat production [Ḣprod]) in the heat (37.5 ± 0.1 °C) at fixed-(16-mmHg) and 
ramped-humidity (∆1.5-mmHg/5-min) following 1 week of oral taurine 
supplementation (50 mg/kg/bm) or placebo, in a double-blind, randomised, 
cross-over design. Participants were assessed for whole-body sweat loss (WBSL), 
local sweat rate (LSR), sweat gland activation (SGA), core temperature (Tcore), 
breakpoint of compensability (Pcrit) and calorimetric heat transfer components. 
Plasma volume and plasma taurine concentrations were established through pre- 
and post-trial blood samples.
RESULTS: Taurine supplementation increased WBSL by 26.6% and 5.1% (p = 0.035), 
LSR by 15.5% and 7.8% (p = 0.013), SGA (1 × 1 cm) by 32.2% and 29.9% (p < 0.001) 
and SGA (3 × 3 cm) by 22.1% and 17.1% (p = 0.015) during the fixed- and 
ramped-humidity exercise periods, respectively. Evaporative heat loss was 
enhanced by 27% (p = 0.010), heat-storage reduced by 72% (p = 0.024) and Pcrit 
was greater in taurine vs placebo (25.0-mmHg vs 21.7-mmHg; p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Taurine supplementation increased sweating responses during fixed 
Ḣprod in hot conditions, prior to substantial heat strain and before the 
breakpoint of compensability, demonstrating improved thermoregulatory capacity. 
The enhanced evaporative cooling and reduced heat-storage delayed the subsequent 
upward inflection in Tcore-represented by a greater Pcrit-and offers a potential 
dietary supplementation strategy to support thermoregulation.

Biomechanical time series may contain low-frequency trends due to factors like 
electromechanical drift, attentional drift and fatigue. Existing detrending 
procedures are predominantly conducted at the trial level, removing trends that 
exist over finite, adjacent time windows, but this fails to consider what we 
term 'cycle-level trends': trends that occur in cyclical movements like gait and 
that vary across the movement cycle, for example: positive and negative drifts 
in early and late gait phases, respectively. The purposes of this study were to 
describe cycle-level detrending and to investigate the frequencies with which 
cycle-level trends (i) exist, and (ii) statistically affect results. 
Anterioposterior ground reaction forces (GRF) from the 41-subject, 8-speed, open 
treadmill walking dataset of Fukuchi (2018) were analyzed. Of a total of 552 
analyzed trials, significant cycle-level trends were found approximately three 
times more frequently (21.1%) than significant trial-level trends (7.4%). In 
statistical comparisons of adjacent walking speeds (i.e., speed 1 vs. 2, 2 vs. 
3, etc.) just 3.3% of trials exhibited cycle-level trends that changed the null 
hypothesis rejection decision. However 17.6% of trials exhibited cycle-level 
trends that qualitatively changed the stance phase regions identified as 
significant. Although these results are preliminary and derived from just one 
dataset, results suggest that cycle-level trends can contribute to analysis 
bias, and therefore that cycle-level trends should be considered and/or removed 
where possible. Software implementing the proposed cycle-level detrending is 
available at https://github.com/0todd0000/detrend1d.

BACKGROUND: Supervised exercise training is recommended for people with 
peripheral artery disease (PAD), yet it remains underutilized. Home-based 
exercise programs (HBEPs) are a potential alternative. The aim of this study was 
to assess the feasibility of conducting a full scale trial of a 12-week HBEP for 
people living with symptomatic PAD.
METHODS: In a randomized feasibility trial, patients with intermittent 
claudication were allocated to either an HBEP or a nonexercise control. The HBEP 
group was given a Fitbit to use during a 12-week exercise program comprising of 
personalized step goals and a resistance-based circuit to be undertaken at home 
twice weekly. The primary outcome was feasibility, assessed via eligibility, 
recruitment, attrition, tolerability, and adherence. Acceptability was assessed 
via semistructured interviews. Secondary analysis was undertaken to determine 
the feasibility of collecting clinical outcome data.
RESULTS: 188 people were screened, 133 were eligible (70.7%), 30 were recruited 
(22.6%) and one withdrew (3.33%). Mean adherence to the daily step goal was 
53.5% (range = 29.8-90.5%), and 58.6% of prescribed circuits were completed of 
which 56.4% were at the desired intensity. Six adverse events were recorded, 3 
of which were related to study involvement. No significant differences were 
observed in exploratory outcomes. Small clinically important differences were 
seen in walking speed and pain-free treadmill walking distance which should be 
confirmed or refuted in a larger trial.
CONCLUSIONS: The HBEP was feasible and well tolerated, with successful 
recruitment and minimal attrition. The intervention was acceptable, with walking 
seen as more enjoyable than circuit exercise. The WALKSTRONG program may be 
suitable for those who will not, or cannot, take part in supervised exercise 
outside of the home.

PURPOSE: Walking net V˙ O2 tends to increase with advancing age; however, 
factors contributing to this relationship have not been widely described. The 
implications of such findings could inform targeted strategies to promote 
independent mobility in older adults. Herein, we evaluated the relationship 
between net V˙ O2 and age at two submaximal workloads while exploring potential 
moderators of this relationship.
METHODS: Secondary analyses were performed on 35 older (65 ± 3 years) women who 
completed a battery of physical assessments including fixed-speed, non-graded 
and graded (+ 2.5%) treadmill walking with indirect calorimetry to determine net 
V˙ O2. Maximal oxygen uptake ( V˙ O2max), knee extensor maximal isometric 
voluntary contraction (MVC), peak rate of torque development (RTD), and plantar 
flexor range-of-motion (PFROM) were also measured.
RESULTS: Bivariate correlations showed non-graded (r = 0.403, p = 0.017) and 
graded (r = 0.413, p = 0.014) net V˙ O2 were positively related to age. Notably, 
these relationships strengthened after adjusting for V˙ O2max. Regression 
modeling showed age, RTD:MVC ratio (composite of muscle performance), and PFROM 
together explained 49% and 34% of the variance in non-graded and graded net V˙ 
O2, respectively. Further analyses suggested knee extensor MVC moderates the 
relationship between non-graded net V˙ O2 and age, accounting for 9% of the 
variance [ΔR2 = 0.090, F (1,31) = 4.13, p = 0.05].
CONCLUSION: These data support the premise that, in older women, walking net V˙ 
O2 rises with advancing age, and additionally, the RTD:MVC ratio and PFROM are 
independent correlates of non-graded net V˙ O2. Exercise interventions with a 
high degree of training specificity including explosive, velocity-based elements 
may promote independent mobility in older women.

Assigning a value for metabolic rate is central to heat stress assessment. ISO 
8996 describes a predictive method for walking based on the American College of 
Sports Medicine (ACSM) method and another generalized method based on average 
heart rate. In addition, the US Army uses the load carriage decision aid (LCDA) 
predictive equation to estimate metabolic rate. The purpose of this study was to 
assess the accuracy/bias and precision of the ISO heart rate method and the ACSM 
and LCDA equations. The laboratory database included metabolic rate, heart rate, 
treadmill speed, and grade during a progressive heat stress protocol. Treadmill 
speed and grade were set to represent one of three metabolic rates. Accuracy and 
precision were assessed with Bland-Altman plots. All three methods had good 
accuracy (low bias). For precision, the ISO heart rate method had a root mean 
square error (RMSE) of 34 W and 11% when adjusted for repeated measures. The 
RMSE for two equations was 20 W and 7%. Although the heart method had less 
accuracy, its application is more generalizable. The heart rate method should be 
used below the occupational exposure limit for heat stress to avoid a bias 
toward higher predicted values due to heat strain.

Objective: Falling is considered one of the major problems that may affect the 
elderly, leading to multiple health issues. Walking adaptability to 
environmental demands is essential for safe walking in the elderly. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality (VR)/augmented 
reality (AR) treadmill training on balance performance and the risk of falls in 
the elderly. Materials and Methods: Sixty Saudi elderly individuals of both 
genders, aged between 60 and 70 years, participated in the study. The 
participants were categorized into two groups: the experimental and the control 
groups. Both groups received 1 hour of training: 30 minutes of conventional 
exercises and 30 minutes of gait training on the C-Mill VR/AR treadmill. The 
experimental group used the C-Mill treadmill with VR and AR games therapy. The 
control group had gait training on the C-Mill treadmill without VR and AR. The 
training for both groups was conducted for 6 successive weeks/three times a 
week. The changes in the scores of the following variables were recorded at 
baseline, after 6 weeks of training, and 4 weeks after the completion of 
training. These variables involved the time needed for completing the Timed Up 
and Go (TUG) test, overall stability indices of the Fall Risk (FR) test and 
Limit of Stability (LOS) test evaluated using the Biodex Balance System (BBS), 
and the time required for completing the LOS test. Results: Both groups 
demonstrated significant improvement in all measured variables immediately 
post-training, and this improvement persisted for 4 weeks after completing the 
training. The experimental group exhibited greater improvement in the recorded 
values of all measured variables compared with the control group following the 
training. Conclusions: This study concluded that C-Mill VR/AR treadmill training 
is effective in improving balance control and reducing the fall risk in the 
elderly.

Turning on cue or stopping at a red light requires attending to such cues to 
select action sequences, or suppress action, in accordance with learned 
cue-associated action rules. Cortico-striatal projections are an essential part 
of the brain's attention-motor interface. Glutamate-sensing microelectrode 
arrays were used to measure glutamate transients in the dorsomedial striatum 
(DMS) of male and female rats walking a treadmill and executing cued turns and 
stops. Prelimbic-DMS projections were chemogenetically inhibited to determine 
their behavioral necessity and the cortico-striatal origin of cue-evoked 
glutamate transients. Furthermore, we investigated rats exhibiting preferably 
goal-directed (goal trackers, GTs) versus cue-driven attention (sign trackers, 
STs), to determine the impact of such cognitive-motivational biases on 
cortico-striatal control. GTs executed more cued turns and initiated such turns 
more slowly than STs. During turns, but not missed turns or cued stops, 
cue-evoked glutamate concentrations were higher in GTs than in STs. In STs, turn 
cue-locked glutamate concentrations frequently peaked twice or three times, 
contrasting with predominately single peaks in GTs. In GTs, but not STs, 
inhibition of prelimbic-DMS projections attenuated turn rates and turn 
cue-evoked glutamate concentrations and increased the number of turn cue-locked 
glutamate peaks. These findings indicate that turn cue-evoked glutamate release 
in GTs is tightly controlled by cortico-striatal neuronal activity. In contrast, 
in STs, glutamate release from DMS glutamatergic terminals may be regulated by 
other striatal circuitry, preferably mediating cued suppression of action and 
reward tracking. As cortico-striatal dysfunction has been hypothesized to 
contribute to a wide range of disorders, including complex movement control 
deficits in Parkinson's disease and compulsive drug taking, the demonstration of 
phenotypic contrasts in cortico-striatal control implies the presence of 
individual vulnerabilities for such disorders.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Adaptive behavior involves the selection of behaviorally 
significant cues and the capacity of selected cues to control behavioral action. 
Neuronal projections from cortex to striatum are essential for such an 
integration of attentional with motor functions. Here we demonstrated that 
glutamate release from cortico-striatal projections primarily influences cued 
turns but not cued suppression of actions (cued stops). Cortico-striatal control 
of cued turning was especially powerful in rats which, as a psychological trait, 
preferably deploy goal-directed attention. Together, our findings demonstrate 
the role of cortico-striatal input in cued action selection, and they emphasize 
the experimental and biopsychological significance of investigating the brain's 
attentional-motor interface in the context of broader individual differences in 
cognitive-motivational styles.

Spatiotemporal walking performance in different settings: effects of walking 
speed and sex.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors that influence walking is important as 
quantitative walking assessments have potential to inform health risk 
assessments. Wearable technology innovation has enabled quantitative walking 
assessments to be conducted in different settings. Understanding how different 
settings influence quantitative walking performance is required to better 
utilize the health-related potential of quantitative walking assessments.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How does spatiotemporal walking performance differ during 
walking in different settings at different speeds for young adults?
METHODS: Forty-two young adults [21 male (23 ± 4 years), 21 female (24 ± 5 
years)] walked in two laboratory settings (overground, treadmill) and three 
non-laboratory settings (hallway, indoor open, outdoor pathway) at three 
self-selected speeds (slow, preferred, fast) following verbal instructions. Six 
walking trials of each condition (10 m in laboratory overground, 20 m in other 
settings) were completed. Participants wore 17 inertial sensors (Xsens Awinda, 
Movella, Henderson, NV) and spatiotemporal parameters were computed from 
sensor-derived kinematics. Setting × speed × sex repeated measures analysis of 
variance were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Regardless of the speed condition, participants walked faster 
overground when compared to while on the treadmill and walked faster in the 
indoor open and outdoor pathway settings when compared to the laboratory 
overground setting. At slow speeds, participants also walked faster in the 
hallway when compared to the laboratory overground setting. Females had greater 
cadence when compared to males, independent of settings and speed conditions.
SIGNIFICANCE: Particularly at slow speeds, spatiotemporal walking performance 
was different between the settings, suggesting that setting characteristics such 
as walkway boundary definition may significantly influence spatiotemporal 
walking performance.

INTRODUCTION: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is increasingly prevalent, and 
supervised physical exercise programmes are recommended as the first-line 
treatment. However, these programmes are underused. Alternative delivery models 
may be able to expand treatment coverage. The objective of this study was to 
compare a home-based exercise programme (HBEP) and a centre-based exercise (CBE) 
in terms of their effects on functional capacity, peripheral muscle oxygenation 
and quality of life in individuals with PAD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This single-blind, parallel randomised clinical trial will 
consist of two groups: HBEP and CBE. A qualitative analysis will be carried out 
to investigate acceptability and satisfaction. The primary outcome will be 
functional capacity, assessed by the incremental shuttle walk test. Secondary 
outcomes will include functional capacity, assessed by a treadmill walking test; 
peripheral muscle oxygenation and quality of life; and self-reported functional 
impairment, risk factors, morbidity, level of physical activity, adherence, 
acceptability and satisfaction. The intervention protocols will consist of 12 
weeks of intermittent walking until claudication symptoms, three times a week. 
Participants randomly assigned to the CBE group will participate in supervised 
face-to-face sessions. The HBEP group will perform exercises at home with remote 
supervision, monitored by a pedometer and heart rate monitor, and subjective 
perception of effort during each session will be recorded by participants in a 
training diary; follow-up will be conducted by telephone calls. Statistical 
analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Participants allocated to 
the HBEP group will be interviewed about their experience of remote treatment 
using a qualitative approach.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee 
of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. The results will be disseminated in 
a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international congresses. This research 
has the potential to improve the care of people with PAD because if home-based 
rehabilitation demonstrates effectiveness, it could be considered an alternative 
or support resource to the usual centre-based treatment models, expanding 
access, coverage and participation in vascular physiotherapy TRIAL REGISTRATION:

OBJECTIVE: Chronic inflammation and altered walking biomechanics are common 
after ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and contribute to the development of 
osteoarthritis. Clinically accessible techniques are needed to monitor 
inflammation (ultrasound-assessed effusion-synovitis) and walking biomechanics 
(force-measuring insoles), and they must improve the translation of these 
assessments and determine whether inflammation and walking biomechanics are 
related in patients after ACLR. This study aimed to determine the association 
between ultrasound-detected knee effusion-synovitis and limb loading asymmetries 
during walking in patients 1-5 years post-ACLR.
DESIGN: 15 participants (9 women; age: 26 ± 6yrs; mass: 71 ± 15 kg; height: 173 
± 9 cm; months post-ACLR: 29 ± 13) were included in this cross-sectional study. 
Knee effusion-synovitis was assessed using a standardized protocol and graded 
using a validated scoring atlas (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) 
in the ACLR limb. Force-measuring insoles were used to capture the vertical 
ground reaction force (vGRF) during a one-minute treadmill walking trial. Limb 
symmetry indices (LSIs) were used to quantify limb loading asymmetry for the 
peak vGRF and the instantaneous loading rate (vGRF-LR). Spearman correlations 
determined whether effusion-synovitis grade was associated with peak vGRF and 
vGRF-LR LSI.
RESULTS: Effusion-synovitis was present in the ACLR limb of 13/15 (87 %) 
participants (Grade 0: n = 2; Grade 1: n = 8; Grade 2: n = 4, Grade 3: n = 1). 
Effusion-synovitis grade was not significantly associated with peak vGRF LSI 
(mean±sd: 98.0 ± 5.6; ρ = 0.38, p = 0.162), but was significantly associated 
with vGRF-LR LSI (98.2 ± 11.4; ρ = 0.55, p = 0.035).
CONCLUSION: Most participants 1-5 years post-ACLR have ultrasound-detected 
effusion-synovitis. Participants with more severe effusion-synovitis load their 
ACLR limb more rapidly. This study highlights the utility of clinically 
accessible techniques in assessing inflammation and walking biomechanics in ACLR 
patients.

The metabolic cost of walking (MCOW), or oxygen uptake normalized to distance, 
provides information on the energy expended during movement. There are 
conflicting reports as to whether sex differences in MCOW exist, with scarce 
evidence investigating factors that explain potential sex differences. This 
study 1) tested the hypothesis that females exhibit a higher MCOW than males, 2) 
determined whether normalizing to stepping cadence ameliorates the hypothesized 
sex difference, and 3) explored whether more habitual step counts and time in 
intensity-related physical activity, and less sedentary time were associated 
with a decreased MCOW. Seventy-six participants (42 females, 24 ± 5 yr) 
completed a five-stage, graded treadmill protocol with speeds increasing from 
0.89 to 1.79 m/s (6-min walking stage followed by 4-min passive rest). 
Steady-state oxygen uptake (via indirect calorimetry) and stepping cadence (via 
manual counts) were determined. Gross and net MCOW, normalized to distance 
traveled (km) and step-cadence (1,000 steps) were calculated for each stage. 
Thirty-nine participants (23 females) wore an activPAL on their thigh for 
6.9 ± 0.4 days. Normalized to distance, females had greater gross MCOW (J/kg/km) 
at all speeds (P < 0.014). Normalized to stepping frequency, females exhibited 
greater gross and net MCOW at 1.12 and 1.79 m/s (J/kg/1,000 steps; P < 0.01) but 
not at any other speeds (P < 0.075). Stature was negatively associated with 
free-living cadence (r = -0.347, P = 0.030). Females expend more 
energy/kilometer traveled than males, but normalizing to stepping cadence 
attenuated these differences. Such observations provide an explanation for prior 
work documenting higher MCOW among females and highlight the importance of 
stepping cadence when assessing the MCOW.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Whether there are sex 
differences in the metabolic cost of walking (MCOW) and the factors that may 
contribute to these are unclear. We demonstrate that females exhibit a larger 
net MCOW than males. These differences were largely attenuated when normalized 
to stepping cadence. Free-living activity was not associated with MCOW. We 
demonstrate that stepping cadence, but not free-living activity, partially 
explains the higher MCOW in females than males.

This study aimed to compare the ground reaction forces (GRFs) and 
spatio-temporal parameters as well as their asymmetry ratios in gait between 
individuals wearing a transfemoral prosthetic simulator (TFSim) and individuals 
with unilateral transfemoral amputation (TFAmp) across a range of walking speeds 
(2.0-5.5 km h-1). The study recruited 10 non-disabled individuals using TFSim 
and 10 individuals with unilateral TFAmp using a transfemoral prosthesis. Data 
were collected using an instrumented treadmill with built-in force plates, and 
subsequently, the GRFs and spatio-temporal parameters, as well as their 
asymmetry ratios, were analysed. When comparing the TFSim and TFAmp groups, no 
significant differences were found among the gait parameters and asymmetry 
ratios of all tested metrics except the vertical GRFs. The TFSim may not 
realistically reproduce the vertical GRFs during the weight acceptance and 
push-off phases. The structural and functional variations in prosthetic limbs 
and components between the TFSim and TFAmp groups may be primary contributors to 
the difference in the vertical GRFs. These results suggest that TFSim might be 
able to emulate the gait of individuals with TFAmp regarding the majority of 
spatio-temporal and GRF parameters. However, the vertical GRFs of TFSim should 
be interpreted with caution.

The aim of the present study was to examine the associations of adiposity and 
fitness on the preadolescent brain's response to acute exercise. In a sample of 
58 children (ages 8-10; 19 females), demographic measures of age, sex, IQ, 
puberty, and socioeconomic status were considered. Children participated in a 
randomized crossover study, whereby they completed two different interventions; 
seated rest or treadmill walking, counterbalanced across participants. 
Associations between adiposity measures (standardized body mass index [BMI-Z], 
whole body percent fat [%Fat], visceral adipose tissue [VAT]), cardiorespiratory 
fitness measures (VO2max and Fat-Free VO2) were assessed on self-reported 
measures of mental wellbeing, and cognitive performance (response accuracy, 
reaction time) and neuroelectric (P3 amplitude and latency) indices of a Go/NoGo 
task following both exercise and rest interventions. Higher adiposity 
(whole-body percent fat, BMI-Z) was associated with higher trait anxiety 
(P's≤0.05) and disordered eating (P's≤0.05) scores. Higher fitness (VO2max) was 
associated with lower childhood depression scores (P=0.02). Regression analyses 
yielded specific post-exercise neurocognitive associations with 
adiposity-related (VAT, BMI-Z), and fitness-related (FF-VO2) outcomes, after 
controlling for post-rest neurocognitive outcomes. VAT was positively associated 
with post-exercise P3 ERP Latency for the Go task (P≤0.001); BMI-Z was 
negatively associated with P3 ERP amplitudes for the Go task (P's≤0.005); FF-VO2 
was negatively associated with P3 ERP latency for the Go/NoGo task (P's≤0.05), 
and positively associated with NoGo task accuracy (P≤0.001). Overall, adiposity 
and fat-free fitness measures yield sensitive and differential associations with 
neurocognitive performance after exercise and after rest interventions.

BACKGROUND: Gait retraining using haptic biofeedback medially shifts the center 
of pressure (COP) while walking in orthopedic populations. However, the ideal 
sensor location needed to effectively shift COP medially has not been identified 
in people with chronic ankle instability (CAI).
RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Can a heel sensor location feasibly be employed in people 
with CAI without negatively altering kinematics? Does a heel sensor placement 
relative to the 5th metatarsal head (5MH) impact COP location while walking in 
people with CAI?
METHODS: In this exploratory crossover study, 10 participants with CAI walked on 
a treadmill with vibration feedback for 10 minutes with a plantar pressure 
sensor under the heel and 5MH. Separate 2×2 repeated measures analyses of 
covariances (rmANCOVAs) were used to compare the averaged COP location and 3-D 
lower extremity kinematics from the first 10% of stance before and after 
training and between sensor locations. Baseline measures served as covariates to 
adjust for baseline differences.
RESULTS: Feedback triggered by a heel sensor resulted in 40% of participants 
avoiding a heel strike. There were no significant main effects or interactions 
between time and sensor location on COP location when controlling for baseline 
COP (p>0.05). However, with the 5MH placement, participants displayed less ankle 
internal rotation(IR) (5MH/Heel: -4.12±0.00º/ -6.43±0.62º), less forefoot 
abduction (-4.29±0.00º/ -5.14±1.01º), more knee flexion (3.40±0.32º/ 
0.14±0.57º), less knee external rotation (-10.95±0.00º/-11.24±1.48º), less hip 
extension (-0.20±0.00º/-1.42±1.05º), and less hip external rotation 
(3.12±0.00º/3.75±1.98º).
SIGNIFICANCE: A 5MH location may be more feasible based on difficulties 
maintaining heel strike when the sensor was under the heel. While no sensor 
location was statistically better at changing the COP, the 5MH location 
decreased proximal transverse plane motions making participants' gait more like 
controls. Individual response variations support comprehensive lower extremity 
assessments and the need to identify responder profiles using sensory feedback 
in people with CAI.

Background: Efficient gait assistance by augmentative exoskeletons depends on 
reliable control strategies. While numerous control methods and their effects on 
the metabolic cost of walking have been explored in the literature, the use of 
different exoskeletons and dissimilar protocols limit direct comparisons. In 
this article, we present and compare two controllers for hip exoskeletons with 
different synchronization paradigms. Methods: The implicit-synchronization-based 
approach, termed the Simple Reflex Controller (SRC), determines the assistance 
as a function of the relative loading of the feet, resulting in an emerging 
torque profile continuously assisting extension during stance and flexion during 
swing. On the other hand, the Hip-Phase-based Torque profile controller (HPT) 
uses explicit synchronization and estimates the gait cycle percentage based on 
the hip angle, applying a predefined torque profile consisting of two shorter 
bursts of assistance during stance and swing. We tested the controllers with 23 
naïve healthy participants walking on a treadmill at 4 km ⋅ h-1, without any 
substantial familiarization. Results: Both controllers significantly reduced the 
metabolic rate compared to walking with the exoskeleton in passive mode, by 
18.0% (SRC, p < 0.001) and 11.6% (HPT, p < 0.001). However, only the SRC led to 
a significant reduction compared to walking without the exoskeleton (8.8%, p = 
0.004). The SRC also provided more mechanical power and led to bigger changes in 
the hip joint kinematics and walking cadence. Our analysis of mechanical powers 
based on a whole-body analysis suggested a reduce in ankle push-off under this 
controller. There was a strong correlation (Pearson's r = 0.778, p < 0.001) 
between the metabolic savings achieved by each participant with the two 
controllers. Conclusion: The extended assistance duration provided by the 
implicitly synchronized SRC enabled greater metabolic reductions compared to the 
more targeted assistance of the explicitly synchronized HPT. Despite the 
different assistance profiles and metabolic outcomes, the correlation between 
the metabolic reductions with the two controllers suggests a difference in 
individual responsiveness to assistance, prompting more investigations to 
explore the person-specific factors affecting assistance receptivity.

BACKGROUND: Changes in knee loading have been reported after meniscectomy. Knee 
loading has previously been assessed during jogging and treadmill running rather 
than overground running, which could give altered results.
PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate knee function 
during overground running and walking after meniscectomy. It was hypothesized 
that the affected limb would demonstrate higher external knee adduction moment, 
lower knee flexion moment (KFM), and lower knee rotation moment (KRM) compared 
with the contralateral limb and with healthy individuals.
STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.
METHODS: Kinematic and kinetic data were collected during running and walking in 
individuals after a meniscectomy and healthy individuals. Total knee joint 
moments (TKJM) were calculated from the sagittal, frontal, and transverse knee 
moments. Isometric quadriceps strength, perceived knee function, and 
kinesiophobia were also assessed. A mixed linear model compared differences 
between the affected leg, the contralateral leg, and the healthy leg.
RESULTS: Data were collected on 20 healthy individuals and 30 individuals after 
a meniscectomy (mean ± SD, 5.7 ± 2.9 months postsurgery), with 12, 16, and 2 
individuals who had medial, lateral, and both medial and lateral meniscectomy, 
respectively. The affected limb demonstrated lower TKJM (P < .001), KFM (P = 
.004), and KRM (P < .001) during late stance of walking compared with the 
healthy group. Lower TKJM and KFM were observed during running in the affected 
limb compared with the contralateral limb and healthy group. No significant 
differences were observed between contralateral and healthy limbs except for KRM 
during late stance of walking. Lower quadriceps strength was observed in the 
affected (P < .001) and contralateral limbs (P = .001) compared with the healthy 
group. Individuals after a meniscectomy also reported greater kinesiophobia (P = 
.006) and lower perceived knee function (31.1%; P < .001) compared with the 
healthy group.
CONCLUSION: After meniscectomy, individuals who sustained a traumatic meniscal 
injury showed lower TKJM in the affected limb compared with the contralateral 
limb and healthy individuals. This decrease in TKJM can be attributed to altered 
knee-loading strategies in the sagittal and transverse planes.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Improving movement strategies, quadriceps strength, and 
kinesiophobia through rehabilitation approaches will allow individuals to load 
their knee appropriately when returning to sport.

Inspired by the ideas from the fields of gait rehabilitation, neuroscience, and 
locomotion biomechanics and energetics, a body of work is reviewed that has led 
to propose a conceptual framework for novel ""self-assistive"" walking devices 
that could further promote walking recovery from incomplete spinal cord 
injuries. The underlying rationale is based on a neural coupling mechanism that 
governs the coordinated movements of the arms and legs during walking, and that 
the excitability of these neural pathways can be exploited by actively engaging 
the arms during locomotor training. Self-assistive treadmill walking 
rehabilitation devices are envisioned as an approach that would allow an 
individual to actively use their arms to help the legs during walking. It is 
hoped that the conceptual framework inspires the design and use of 
self-assistive walking devices that are tailored to assist individuals with an 
incomplete spinal cord injury to regain their functional walking ability.

Dynamics of Center of Pressure Trajectory in Gait: Unilateral Transfemoral 
Amputees Versus Non-Disabled Individuals.

He Y, Hu M, Jor A, Hobara H, Gao F, Kobayashi T.

The primary goal of rehabilitation for individuals with lower limb amputation, 
particularly those with unilateral transfemoral amputation (uTFA), is to restore 
their ability to walk independently. Effective control of the center of pressure 
(COP) during gait is vital for maintaining balance and stability, yet it poses a 
significant challenge for individuals with uTFA. This study aims to study the 
COP during gait in individuals with uTFA and elucidate their unique compensatory 
strategies. This study involved 12 uTFA participants and age-matched 
non-disabled controls, with gait and COP trajectory data collected using an 
instrumented treadmill. Gait and COP parameters between the control limb (CL), 
prosthetic limb (PL), and intact limb (IL) were compared. Notably, the 
mediolateral displacement of COP in PL exhibited significant lateral 
displacement compared to the CL from 30% to 60% of the stance. In 20% to 45% of 
the stance, the COP forward speed of PL was significantly higher than that of 
the IL. Furthermore, during the initial 20% of the stance, the vertical ground 
reaction force of PL was significantly lower than that of IL. Additionally, 
individuals with uTFA exhibited a distinct gait pattern with altered duration of 
loading response, single limb support, pre-swing and swing phases, and step 
time. These findings indicate the adaptability of individuals with uTFA in 
weight transfer, balance control, and pressure distribution on gait stability. 
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the unique gait 
dynamics and balance strategies of uTFA patients, highlighting the importance of 
optimizing prosthetic design, alignment procedures, and rehabilitation programs 
to enhance gait patterns and reduce the risk of injuries due to compensatory 
movements.

Background: Given the inherent variability in walking speeds encountered in 
day-to-day activities, understanding the corresponding alterations in ankle 
biomechanics would provide valuable clinical insights. Therefore, the objective 
of this study was to examine the influence of different walking speeds on 
biomechanical parameters, utilizing gait analysis and musculoskeletal modelling. 
Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers without any lower limb medical history were 
included in this study. Treadmill-assisted gait-analysis with walking speeds of 
0.8 m/s and 1.1 m/s was performed using the Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive 
Lab (GRAIL®). Collected kinematic data and ground reaction forces were processed 
via the AnyBody® modeling system to determine ankle kinetics and muscle forces 
of the lower leg. Data were statistically analyzed using statistical parametric 
mapping to reveal both spatiotemporal and magnitude significant differences. 
Results: Significant differences were found for both magnitude and 
spatiotemporal curves between 0.8 m/s and 1.1 m/s for the ankle flexion (p < 
0.001), subtalar force (p < 0.001), ankle joint reaction force and muscles 
forces of the M. gastrocnemius, M. soleus and M. peroneus longus (α = 0.05). No 
significant spatiotemporal differences were found between 0.8 m/s and 1.1 m/s 
for the M. tibialis anterior and posterior. Discussion: A significant impact on 
ankle joint kinematics and kinetics was observed when comparing walking speeds 
of 0.8 m/s and 1.1 m/s. The findings of this study underscore the influence of 
walking speed on the biomechanics of the ankle. Such insights may provide a 
biomechanical rationale for several therapeutic and preventative strategies for 
ankle conditions.

Interval walking training (IWT) is a free-living training intervention involving 
alternating fast and slow walking cycles. IWT is efficacious in improving 
physical fitness and muscle strength, and reducing factors associated with 
lifestyle-related diseases. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, IWT improves 
glycemic control directly through enhanced glucose effectiveness, challenging 
conventional views on mechanisms behind training-induced improvements in 
glycemic control. Whereas adherence to IWT in short-term studies is high, 
ensuring long-term adherence remains a challenge, particularly in populations 
with chronic diseases and/or overweight/obesity. Long-term studies in real-world 
settings are imperative to ascertain the widespread effectiveness of IWT and 
elucidate its impact on hard endpoints.

Reducing energy consumption during walking is a critical goal for transtibial 
amputees. The study presents the evaluation of a semi-active prosthesis with 
five transtibial amputees. The prosthesis has a low-power actuator integrated in 
parallel into an energy-storing-and-releasing foot. The actuator is controlled 
to compress the foot during the stance phase, supplementing the natural 
compression due to the user's dynamic interaction with the ground, particularly 
during the ankle dorsiflexion phase, and to release the energy stored in the 
foot during the push-off phase, to enhance propulsion. The control strategy is 
adaptive to the user's gait patterns and speed. The clinical protocol to 
evaluate the system included treadmill and overground walking tasks. The results 
showed that walking with the semi-active prosthesis reduced the Physiological 
Cost Index of transtibial amputees by up to 16% compared to walking using the 
subjects' proprietary prosthesis. No significant alterations were observed in 
the spatiotemporal gait parameters of the participants, indicating the module's 
compatibility with users' natural walking patterns. These findings highlight the 
potential of the mechatronic actuator in effectively reducing energy expenditure 
during walking for transtibial amputees. The proposed prosthesis may bring a 
positive impact on the quality of life, mobility, and functional performance of 
individuals with transtibial amputation.

BACKGROUND: Excessive body weight is associated with gait alterations. In none 
of previous studies, body fat distribution has been considered as a factor that 
could change gait parameters and induce different neuromuscular adaptations.
OBJECTIVE: This multicenter, analytical, and cross-sectional study aimed to 
investigate the influence of the body mass distribution on gait parameters and 
ankle muscle coactivation in obese individuals.
METHODS: Three distinct groups were included in the study: a non-obese control 
group (CG, n = 15, average age = 32.8 ± 6.5 years, BMI = 21.4 ± 2.2 kg/m2), an 
obese-android group characterized by a Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR) greater than 1 
(OAG, n = 15, age = 32.4 ± 3.9 years, BMI = 41.4 ± 3.9 kg/m2, WHR = 1.2 ± 0.2), 
and an obese-gynoid group with a WHR less than 1 (OGG, n = 15, age = 35.4 ± 4.1 
years, BMI = 40.0 ± 5.7 kg/m2, WHR = 0.82 ± 0.3). All participants walked on an 
instrumented gait analysis treadmill at their self-selected walking speed for 
one minute. Spatiotemporal parameters, walking cycle phases, vertical ground 
reaction force (GRFv) and center of pressure (CoP) velocity were sampled from 
the treadmill software. Electromyography (EMG) activity of the gastrocnemius 
medialis (GM), the soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) were collected during 
walking and used to calculate coactivation indexes (CI) between ankle plantar 
and dorsal flexors (GM/TA and SOL/TA) for the different walking cycle phases.
RESULTS: Compared to OAG, OGG walked with shorter and larger strides, lower CoP 
velocity and GRFv. During the single support phase, SOL/TA coactivation was 
higher in OAG compared to OGG (p < .05). During the propulsion phase, SOL/TA 
coactivation was higher in OGG compared to OAG (p < .05).
CONCLUSION: Gait parameters and ankle muscle coactivation in obese individuals 
seem to be strongly dependent on body mass distribution. From the biomechanical 
point of view, body mass distribution changes gait strategies in obese 
individuals inducing different neuromuscular adaptations during the single 
support and propulsion phases.

BACKGROUND: Joint damage in patients with haemophilia (PwH) is commonly assessed 
by imaging, but few reports have described how structural changes in joints, for 
example, haemophilic arthropathy (HA)-affect gait ability.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated gait function among PwH with HA, PwH without HA, and 
people without haemophilia (non-PwH) using a Zebris FDM-T treadmill (FDM-T), an 
easy-to-use gait assessment instrument with a force sensor matrix.
METHODS: The following gait parameters were collected: centre of pressure 
trajectory intersection (COPi) anterior/posterior variability, COPi lateral 
variability, COPi anterior/posterior symmetry, COPi lateral symmetry, 
single-limb support line (SLSL) length, and SLSL variability. Participants 
walked at their typical gait speed. The physical function of the PwH was 
assessed by the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS). Parameters were compared 
among the three groups.
RESULTS: Twelve PwH with HA, 28 PwH without HA, and 12 non-PwH were enrolled. 
Gait speed significantly differed between groups (non-PwH, 3.1 ± 0.7; PwH 
without HA, 2.0 ± 0.7; PwH with HA; 1.5 ± 0.4). The COPi anterior/posterior 
variability, COPi lateral variability, SLSL length, and SLSL variability were 
greater in the PwH groups than in the non-PwH group. The COPi lateral symmetry 
differed between PwH with HA and the other groups. The HJHS was not correlated 
with gait parameters among PwH with HA.
CONCLUSIONS: Gait parameters and speed were abnormal in both PwH with HA and PwH 
without HA. The FDM-T can be used to identify early stages of physical 
dysfunction that cannot be detected by conventional functional assessments such 
as the HJHS.

Muscle synergies as functional low-dimensional building blocks of the neuromotor 
system regulate the activation patterns of muscle groups in a modular structure 
during locomotion. The purpose of the current study was to explore how older 
adults organize locomotor muscle synergies to counteract unpredictable and 
predictable gait perturbations during the perturbed steps and the recovery 
steps. Sixty-three healthy older adults (71.2±5.2 years) participated in the 
study. Mediolateral and anteroposterior unpredictable and predictable 
perturbations during walking were introduced using a treadmill. Muscle synergies 
were extracted from the electromyographic activity of 13 lower limb muscles 
using Gaussian non-negative matrix factorization. The four basic synergies 
responsible for unperturbed walking (weight acceptance, propulsion, early swing 
and late swing) were preserved in all applied gait perturbations, yet their 
temporal recruitment and muscle contribution in each synergy were modified 
(P<0.05). These modifications were observed for up to four recovery steps and 
were more pronounced (P<0.05) following unpredictable perturbations. The 
recruitment of the four basic walking synergies in the perturbed and recovery 
gait cycles indicates a robust neuromotor control of locomotion by using 
activation patterns of a few and well-known muscle synergies with specific 
adjustments within the synergies. The selection of pre-existing muscle synergies 
while adjusting the time of their recruitment during challenging locomotor 
conditions may improve the effectiveness to deal with perturbations and promote 
the transfer of adaptation between different kinds of perturbations.

Measuring or estimating the forces acting on the human body during movement is 
critical for determining the biomechanical aspects relating to injury, disease 
and healthy ageing. In this study we examined whether quantifying whole-body 
motion (segmental accelerations) using a commercial markerless motion capture 
system could accurately predict three-dimensional ground reaction force during a 
diverse range of human movements: walking, running, jumping and cutting. We 
synchronously recorded 3D ground reaction forces (force instrumented treadmill 
or in-ground plates) with high-resolution video from eight cameras that were 
spatially calibrated relative to a common coordinate system. We used a 
commercially available software to reconstruct whole body motion, along with a 
geometric skeletal model to calculate the acceleration of each segment and hence 
the whole-body centre of mass and ground reaction force across each movement 
task. The average root mean square difference (RMSD) across all three dimensions 
and all tasks was 0.75 N/kg, with the maximum average RMSD being 1.85 N/kg for 
running vertical force (7.89 % of maximum). There was very strong agreement 
between peak forces across tasks, with R2 values indicating that the markerless 
prediction algorithm was able to predict approximately 95-99 % of the variance 
in peak force across all axes and movements. The results were comparable to 
previous reports using whole-body marker-based approaches and hence this 
provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that markerless motion capture can 
be used to predict ground reaction forces and therefore potentially assess 
movement kinetics with limited requirements for participant preparation.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 2-year course of walking adaptability in persons with 
late effects of polio.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
PATIENTS: A total of 48 persons with late effects of polio (69% female, mean age 
63.1 years) with a fall history and/or fear of falling.
METHODS: Walking adaptability (i.e. variable target-stepping and reactive 
obstacle-avoidance) was assessed on an interactive treadmill at baseline, 1 year 
and 2 years. Further, leg-muscle strength and balance were assessed at baseline. 
The course of walking adaptability was analysed with linear mixed models. Based 
on median values, subgroups were defined for low vs high baseline 
walking-adaptability and for clinical characteristics. Tme by subgroup 
interactions were analysed.
RESULTS: Variable target-stepping and reactive obstacle-avoidance did not change 
(p > 0.285). Reactive obstacle-avoidance improved for persons with a high 
balance score at baseline (p = 0.037), but not for those with lower scores 
(p = 0.531). No other time by subgroup interactions were found (p > 0.126).
CONCLUSION: Walking adaptability did not change in persons with late effects of 
polio over 2 years, and walking adaptability course did not differ between 
subgroups stratified for walking adaptability determinants, except for balance. 
Since falls are a major problem among persons with late effects of polio, future 
studies should investigate whether walking adaptability declines over a longer 
time and which persons are most at risk.

BACKGROUND: Increased spatiotemporal gait variability is considered a clinical 
biomarker of ageing and pathology, and a predictor of future falls. 
Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the increased spatiotemporal variability 
observed in persons with stroke is directly related to the pathology or simply 
reflects their choice of walking velocity.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Does increased spatiotemporal gait variability directly 
relate to motor coordination deficits after stroke?
METHODS: Forty persons with stroke participated in this cross-sectional study. 
Participants performed the lower-extremity motor coordination test (LEMOCOT) on 
an electronic mat equipped with force sensors. Then, participants walked for 
120 s on a computerized treadmill at their comfortable walking velocity. For the 
LEMOCOT we used the traditional score of in-target touch count and computed the 
absolute and variable error around the targets. For gait variability, we 
extracted the standard deviation of step time, step length, step velocity, and 
step width. Using linear modeling, we tested the correlations of gait 
variability with the outcome measures from the LEMOCOT, after controlling for 
walking velocity.
RESULTS: The variability in step time, step length and step width correlated 
with walking velocity, while the variability in step velocity did not. After 
controlling for walking velocity, we observed that the LEMOCOT score correlated 
with the variance in step time, and the variable error in the LEMOCOT correlated 
with the variance in step length, in step width, and in step velocity. No 
significant correlation with any of the velocity-controlled step parameters was 
found for the absolute error in the LEMOCOT.
SIGNIFICANCE: Decreased performance in the LEMOCOT was associated with increased 
spatiotemporal variability in persons with stroke, regardless of their walking 
velocity. Our results demonstrate the connection between lower-extremity 
coordination impairments and deficits in gait function.

RATIONALE: Monitoring physiological strain is recommended to safeguard workers 
during heat exposure, but is logistically challenging. The perceptual strain 
index (PeSI) is a subjective estimate thought to reflect the physiological 
strain index (PSI) that requires no physiological monitoring. However, sex is 
known to influence perceptions of heat stress, potentially limiting the utility 
of the PeSI.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess whether sex modifies the 
relationship between PeSI and PSI.
METHODS: Thirty-four adults (15 females) walked on a treadmill (moderate 
intensity; ~200 W/m2) for 180 min or until termination (volitional fatigue, 
rectal temperature ≥39.5°C) in 16°C, 24°C, 28°C, and 32°C wet-bulb globe 
temperatures. Rectal temperature and heart rate were recorded to calculate PSI 
(0-10 scale). Rating of perceived exertion and thermal sensation were recorded 
to calculate PeSI (0-10 scale). Relationships between PSI and PeSI were 
evaluated via linear mixed models. Mean bias (95% limits of agreement [LoA]) 
between PSI and PeSI was assessed via Bland-Altman analysis. Mean absolute error 
between measures was calculated by summing absolute errors between the PeSI and 
the PSI and dividing by the sample size.
FINDINGS: PSI increased with PeSI (p < 0.01) but the slope of this relation was 
not different between males and females (p = 0.83). Mean bias between PSI and 
PeSI was small (-0.4 points), but the 95% LoA (-3.5 to 2.7 points) and mean 
absolute error were wide (1.3 points).
IMPACT: Our findings indicate that sex does not appreciably impact the agreement 
between the PeSI and PSI during simulated occupational heat stress. The PeSI is 
not a suitable surrogate for the PSI in either male or female workers.

Personalised footwear could be used to enhance the function of the foot-ankle 
complex to a person's maximum. Human-in-the-loop optimization could be used as 
an effective and efficient way to find a personalised optimal rocker profile 
(i.e., apex position and angle). The outcome of this process likely depends on 
the selected optimization objective and its responsiveness to the rocker 
parameters being tuned. This study aims to explore whether and how 
human-in-the-loop optimization via different cost functions (i.e., metabolic 
cost, collision work as measure for external mechanical work, and step distance 
variability as measure for gait stability) affects the optimal apex position and 
angle of a rocker profile differently for individuals during walking. Ten 
healthy individuals walked on a treadmill with experimental rocker shoes in 
which apex position and angle were optimized using human-in-the-loop 
optimization using different cost functions. We compared the obtained optimal 
apex parameters for the different cost functions and how these affected the 
selected gait related objectives. Optimal apex parameters differed substantially 
between participants and optimal apex positions differed between cost functions. 
The responsiveness to changes in apex parameters differed between cost 
functions. Collision work was the only cost function that resulted in a 
significant improvement of its performance criteria. Improvements in metabolic 
cost or step distance variability were not found after optimization. This study 
showed that cost function selection is important when human-in-the-loop 
optimization is used to design personalised footwear to allow conversion to an 
optimum that suits the individual.

BACKGROUND: Quadriceps dysfunction is common following anterior cruciate 
ligament reconstruction and contributes to aberrant gait biomechanics. Changes 
in quadriceps composition also occur in these patients including greater 
concentrations of non-contractile tissue. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate associations between quadriceps composition, function, and gait 
biomechanics in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
METHODS: Forty-eight volunteers with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction 
completed gait biomechanics and quadriceps function and composition assessments. 
Gait biomechanics were sampled during downhill walking (-10° slope) on an 
instrumented treadmill. Quadriceps function (peak torque and rate of torque 
development) was assessed via maximal isometric contractions, while composition 
was evaluated via ultrasound echo intensity.
FINDINGS: Greater quadriceps peak torque was associated with a greater peak knee 
extension moment (r = 0.365, p = 0.015). Greater vastus lateralis echo intensity 
(i.e. poorer muscle quality) was associated with less knee flexion displacement 
(r = -0.316, p = 0.032). Greater echo intensity of the vastus lateralis 
(r = -0.298, p = 0.044) and rectus femoris (r = -0.322, p = 0.029) was 
associated with a more abducted knee angle at heel strike. Quadriceps peak 
torque explained 11-16% of the variance in echo intensity.
INTERPRETATION: Both quadriceps function and composition influence aberrant gait 
biomechanics following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Quadriceps 
composition appears to provide insight into quadriceps dysfunction independent 
of muscle strength, as they associated with different gait biomechanics outcomes 
and shared minimal variance. Future research is necessary to determine the 
influence of changes in quadriceps composition on joint health outcomes.

Evaluating variability and stability using measures for nonlinear dynamics may 
provide additional insight into the structure of the locomotor system, 
reflecting the neuromuscular system's organization of gait. This is in 
particular of interest when this system is affected by a respiratory disease and 
it's extrapulmonary manifestations. This study assessed stride-to-stride 
fluctuations and gait stability in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) during a self-paced, treadmill 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and its 
association with clinical outcomes. In this cross-sectional study, eighty 
patients with COPD (age 62±7y; forced expiratory volume in first second 
56±19%predicted) and 39 healthy older adults (62±7y) were analyzed. Gait 
parameters including stride-to-stride fluctuations (coefficient of variation 
(CoV), predictability (sample entropy) and stability (Local Divergence Exponent 
(LDE)) were calculated over spatiotemporal parameters and center of mass 
velocity. Independent t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and ANCOVA analyses were 
conducted. Correlations were calculated between gait parameters, functional 
mobility using Timed Up and Go Test, and quadriceps muscle strength using 
dynamometry. Patients walked slower than healthy older adults. After correction 
for Speed, patients demonstrated increased CoV in stride length (F(1,116) = 
5.658, p = 0.019), and increased stride length predictability (F(1,116) = 3.959, 
p = 0.049). Moderate correlations were found between mediolateral center of mass 
velocity LDE and normalized maximum peak torque (ρ = -0.549). This study showed 
that patients with COPD demonstrate alterations in stride length fluctuations 
even when adjusted for walking speed, highlighting the potential of nonlinear 
measures to detect alterations in gait function in patients with COPD. 
Association with clinical outcomes were moderate to weak, indicating that these 
clinical test are less discriminative for gait alterations.

This study investigates the effects of varying loading conditions on 
excitability in neural pathways and gait dynamics. We focussed on evaluating the 
magnitude of the Hoffman reflex (H-reflex), a neurophysiological measure 
representing the capability to activate motor neurons and the timing and 
placement of the foot during walking. We hypothesized that weight manipulation 
would alter H-reflex magnitude, footfall and lower body kinematics. Twenty 
healthy participants were recruited and subjected to various weight-loading 
conditions. The H-reflex, evoked by stimulating the tibial nerve, was assessed 
from the dominant leg during walking. Gait was evaluated under five conditions: 
body weight, 20% and 40% additional body weight, and 20% and 40% reduced body 
weight (via a harness). Participants walked barefoot on a treadmill under each 
condition, and the timing of electrical stimulation was set during the stance 
phase shortly after the heel strike. Results show that different weight-loading 
conditions significantly impact the timing and placement of the foot and gait 
stability. Weight reduction led to a 25% decrease in double limb support time 
and an 11% narrowing of step width, while weight addition resulted in an 
increase of 9% in step width compared to body weight condition. Furthermore, 
swing time variability was higher for both the extreme weight conditions, while 
the H-reflex reduced to about 45% between the extreme conditions. Finally, the 
H-reflex showed significant main effects on variability of both stance and swing 
phases, indicating that muscle-motor excitability might serve as feedback for 
enhanced regulation of gait dynamics under challenging conditions.

Passive ankle-foot prostheses are light-weighted and reliable, but they cannot 
generate net positive power, which is essential in restoring the natural gait 
pattern of amputees. Recent robotic prostheses addressed the problem by actively 
controlling the storage and release of energy generated during the stance phase 
through the mechanical deformation of elastic elements housed in the device. 
This study proposes an innovative low-power active prosthetic module that fits 
on off-the-shelf passive ankle-foot energy-storage-and-release (ESAR) 
prostheses. The module is placed parallel to the ESAR foot, actively augmenting 
the energy stored in the foot and controlling the energy return for an enhanced 
push-off. The parallel elastic actuation takes advantage of the amputee's 
natural loading action on the foot's elastic structure, retaining its 
deformation. The actuation unit is designed to additionally deform the foot and 
command the return of the total stored energy. The control strategy of the 
prosthesis adapts to changes in the user's cadence and loading conditions to 
return the energy at a desired stride phase. An early verification on two 
transtibial amputees during treadmill walking showed that the proposed mechanism 
could increase the subjects' dorsiflexion peak of 15.2% and 41.6% for subjects 1 
and 2, respectively, and the cadence of about 2%. Moreover, an increase of 26% 
and 45% was observed in the energy return for subjects 1 and 2, respectively.

The development of wearable technology, which enables motion tracking analysis 
for human movement outside the laboratory, can improve awareness of personal 
health and performance. This study used a wearable smart sock prototype to track 
foot-ankle kinematics during gait movement. Multivariable linear regression and 
two deep learning models, including long short-term memory (LSTM) and 
convolutional neural networks, were trained to estimate the joint angles in 
sagittal and frontal planes measured by an optical motion capture system. 
Participant-specific models were established for ten healthy subjects walking on 
a treadmill. The prototype was tested at various walking speeds to assess its 
ability to track movements for multiple speeds and generalize models for 
estimating joint angles in sagittal and frontal planes. LSTM outperformed other 
models with lower mean absolute error (MAE), lower root mean squared error, and 
higher R-squared values. The average MAE score was less than 1.138° and 0.939° 
in sagittal and frontal planes, respectively, when training models for each 
speed and 2.15° and 1.14° when trained and evaluated for all speeds. These 
results indicate wearable smart socks to generalize foot-ankle kinematics over 
various walking speeds with relatively low error and could consequently be used 
to measure gait parameters without the need for a lab-constricted motion capture 
system.

The effects of swing assistance in a microprocessor-controlled transfemoral 
prosthesis on walking at varying speeds and grades.

This article proposes, describes, and tests a swing-assist walking controller 
for a stance-controlled, swing-assisted knee prosthesis that aims to combine 
benefits of passive swing mechanics (e.g., quiet operation, biomimetic function, 
and low power requirements) with benefits of powered swing assistance (e.g., 
increased robustness of swing-phase motion and specifically increased toe 
clearance). A three-participant, multislope, multispeed treadmill walking study 
was performed using the swing-assist prosthesis and controller, as well as using 
the participants' prescribed microprocessor knee devices. The swing-assist 
device and approach were found to improve user minimum foot clearance during 
walking at slopes and speeds, and also to improve symmetry of knee motion. Hip 
power inputs from stance knee release to heel strike indicated that, on average, 
less hip power was required when using the swing-assist prosthesis, indicating 
that the observed benefits were likely the result of the knee device and its 
control methodology, rather than a result of increased hip joint effort.

The ability to accurately identify human gait intent is a challenge relevant to 
the success of many applications in robotics, including, but not limited to, 
assistive devices. Most existing intent identification approaches, however, are 
either sensor-specific or use a pattern-recognition approach that requires large 
amounts of training data. This paper introduces a real-time walking speed intent 
identification algorithm based on the Mahalanobis distance that requires minimal 
training data. This data efficiency is enabled by making the simplifying 
assumption that each time step of walking data is independent of all other time 
steps. The accuracy of the algorithm was analyzed through human-subject 
experiments that were conducted using controlled walking speed changes on a 
treadmill. Experimental results confirm that the model used for intent 
identification converges quickly (within 5 min of training data). On average, 
the algorithm successfully detected the change in desired walking speed within 
one gait cycle and had a maximum of 87% accuracy at responding with the correct 
intent category of speed up, slow down, or no change. The findings also show 
that the accuracy of the algorithm improves with the magnitude of the speed 
change, while speed increases were more easily detected than speed decreases.

chronic stroke.

Many individuals who experience a stroke exhibit reduced modulation of their 
mediolateral foot placement, an important gait stabilization strategy. One 
factor that may contribute to this deficit is altered somatosensory processing, 
which can be probed by applying vibration to the involved muscles (e.g., the hip 
abductors). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether appropriately 
controlled hip abductor vibration can increase foot placement modulation among 
people with chronic stroke. 40 people with chronic stroke performed a series of 
treadmill walking trials without vibration and with vibration of either the hip 
abductors or lateral trunk (a control condition) that scaled with their 
real-time mediolateral motion. To assess participants' vibration sensitivity, we 
also measured vibration detection threshold and lateral sway evoked by abductor 
vibration during quiet standing. As a group, foot placement modulation increased 
significantly with either hip or trunk vibration, compared to without vibration. 
However, these changes were quite variable across participants, and were not 
predicted by either vibration detection threshold or the lateral sway evoked by 
hip vibration during standing. Overall, we found that somatosensory stimulation 
had small, positive effects on post-stroke foot placement modulation. 
Unexpectedly, these effects were observed with both hip abductor and lateral 
trunk vibration, perhaps indicating that the trunk can also provide useful 
somatosensory feedback during walking. Future work is needed to determine 
whether repeated application of such somatosensory stimulation can produce 
sustained effects on this important gait stabilization strategy.

BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis causes structural joint damage. The resultant 
symptoms can impair the ability to recover from unexpected gait perturbations. 
This study compared balance recovery responses to moderate gait perturbations 
between individuals with knee osteoarthritis and healthy individuals.
METHODS: Kinematic data of 35 individuals with end-stage knee osteoarthritis, 
and 32 healthy individuals in the same age range were obtained during perturbed 
walking on a treadmill at 1.0 m/s. Participants received anteroposterior 
(acceleration or deceleration) or mediolateral perturbations during the stance 
phase. Changes from baseline in margin of stability, step length, step time, and 
step width during the first two steps after perturbation were compared between 
groups using a linear regression model. Extrapolated center of mass excursion 
was descriptively analyzed.
FINDINGS: After all perturbation modes, extrapolated center of mass trajectories 
overlapped between individuals with knee osteoarthritis and healthy individuals. 
Participants predominantly responded to mediolateral perturbations by adjusting 
their step width, and to anteroposterior perturbations by adjusting step length 
and step time. None of the perturbation modes yielded between-group differences 
in changes in margin of stability and step width during the first two steps 
after perturbation. Small between-group differences were observed for step 
length (i.e. 2 cm) of the second step after mediolateral and anteroposterior 
perturbations, and for step time (i.e. 0.01-0.02 s) of first step after 
mediolateral perturbations and the second step after outward and belt 
acceleration perturbations.
INTERPRETATION: Despite considerable pain and damage to the knee joint, 
individuals with knee osteoarthritis showed comparable balance recovery 
responses after moderate gait perturbations to healthy participants.

The ability to estimate lower-extremity mechanics in real-world scenarios may 
untether biomechanics research from a laboratory environment. This is 
particularly important for military populations where outdoor ruck marches over 
variable terrain and the addition of external load are cited as leading causes 
of musculoskeletal injury As such, this study aimed to examine (1) the validity 
of a minimal IMU sensor system for quantifying lower-extremity kinematics during 
treadmill walking and running compared with optical motion capture (OMC) and (2) 
the sensitivity of this IMU system to kinematic changes induced by load, grade, 
or a combination of the two. The IMU system was able to estimate hip and knee 
range of motion (ROM) with moderate accuracy during walking but not running. 
However, SPM analyses revealed IMU and OMC kinematic waveforms were 
significantly different at most gait phases. The IMU system was capable of 
detecting kinematic differences in knee kinematic waveforms that occur with 
added load but was not sensitive to changes in grade that influence 
lower-extremity kinematics when measured with OMC. While IMUs may be able to 
identify hip and knee ROM during gait, they are not suitable for replicating 
lab-level kinematic waveforms.

Walking rehabilitation following injury or disease involves voluntary gait 
modification, yet the specific brain signals underlying this process remains 
unclear. This aim of this study was to investigate the impact of an auditory cue 
on changes in brain activity when walking overground (O) and on a treadmill (T) 
using an electroencephalogram (EEG) with a 32-electrode montage. Employing a 
between-group repeated-measures design, 24 participants (age: 25.7 ± 3.8 years) 
were randomly allocated to either an O (n = 12) or T (n = 12) group to complete 
two walking conditions (self-selected speed control (sSC) and speed control 
(SC)). The differences in brain activities during the gait cycle were 
investigated using statistical non-parametric mapping (SnPM). The addition of an 
auditory cue did not modify cortical activity in any brain area during the gait 
cycle when walking overground (all p > 0.05). However, significant differences 
in EEG activity were observed in the delta frequency band (0.5-4 Hz) within the 
sSC condition between the O and T groups. These differences occurred at the 
central frontal (loading phase) and frontocentral (mid stance phase) brain areas 
(p < 0.05). Our data suggest auditory cueing has little impact on modifying 
cortical activity during overground walking. This may have practical 
implications in neuroprosthesis development for walking rehabilitation, sports 
performance optimization, and overall human quality-of-life improvement.

INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown that anticipatory postural adjustments 
(APAs) are altered in people with Parkinson's disease but its meaning for 
locomotion is less understood. This study aims to investigate the association 
between APAs and gait initiation, gait and freezing of gait and how a dynamic 
postural control challenging training may induce changes in these features.
METHODS: Gait initiation was quantified using wearable sensors and subsequent 
straight walking was assessed via marker-based motion capture. Additionally, 
turning and FOG-related outcomes were measured with wearable sensors. 
Assessments were conducted one week before (Pre), one week after (Post) and 4 
weeks after (Follow-up) completion of a training intervention (split-belt 
treadmill training or regular treadmill training), under single task and dual 
task (DT) conditions. Statistical analysis included a linear mixed model for 
training effects and correlation analysis between APAs and the other outcomes 
for Pre and Post-Pre delta.
RESULTS: 52 participants with Parkinson's disease (22 freezers) were assessed. 
We found that APA size in the medio-lateral direction during DT was positively 
associated with gait speed (p<0.001) and stride length (p<0.001) under DT 
conditions at Pre. The training effect was largest for first step range of 
motion and was similar for both training modes. For the associations between 
changes after the training (pooled sample) medio-lateral APA size showed a 
significant positive correlation with first step range of motion (p = 0.033) 
only in the DT condition and for the non-freezers only.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this work revealed new insights into how APAs were 
not associated with first step characteristics and freezing and only baseline 
APAs during DT were related with DT gait characteristics. Training-induced 
changes in the size of APAs were related to training benefits in the first step 
ROM only in non-freezers. Based on the presented results increasing APA size 
through interventions might not be the ideal target for overall improvement of 
locomotion.

BACKGROUND: Roughly 800,000 people experience a stroke every year in the United 
States, and about 30% of people require walking assistance (walker, cane, etc.) 
after a stroke. Gait training on a treadmill is a common rehabilitation activity 
for individuals post-stroke and handrails are typically used to assist with 
walking during this training, however individual interaction with these 
handrails are not usually considered and quantitatively reported. Individuals 
may exert force onto the handrails to aid with propulsive force, but the 
relationship between limb propulsive force and handrail propulsive force are not 
known.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How do individuals post-stroke alter paretic propulsive force 
when using an assistive device, such as handrails on a treadmill?
METHODS: Twenty-one individuals post-stroke (eight current assistive device 
users and thirteen individuals who do not use an assistive device) walked on a 
treadmill for 3 min during three conditions: no handrail use, light handrail use 
(<5% BW) and self-selected handrail use. Three multilevel models were used to 
compare percent handrail, paretic and nonparetic propulsion between handrail 
conditions and assistive device groups.
RESULTS: The handrail propulsive impulse was more during the self-selected 
handrail condition compared to the light handrail condition (p = 0.002). The 
assistive device use group and the handrail condition fixed effects 
significantly improved the model fit for paretic propulsive impulse (p = 0.01). 
The interaction between assistive device use group and handrail condition 
significantly improved the model fit for nonparetic propulsive impulse 
(p < 0.001).
SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that handrail use may impact paretic 
propulsive impulse. Our initial results suggest that if the goal of 
rehabilitation treadmill training is to increase the paretic propulsive impulse, 
having the clinician encourage walking with the handrails may be optimal to 
promote paretic propulsion.

PURPOSE: Considering the relationship between aging and neuromuscular control 
decline, early detection of age-related changes can ensure that timely 
interventions are implemented to attenuate or restore neuromuscular deficits. 
The dynamic motor control index (DMCI), a measure based on variance accounted 
for (VAF) by one muscle synergy (MS), is a metric used to assess age-related 
changes in neuromuscular control. The aim of the study was to investigate the 
use of one-synergy VAF, and consecutively DMCI, in assessing age-related changes 
in neuromuscular control over a range of exercises with varying difficulty.
METHODS: Thirty-one subjects walked on a flat and inclined treadmill, as well as 
performed forward and lateral stepping up tasks. Motion and muscular activity 
were recorded, and muscle synergy analysis was conducted using one-synergy VAF, 
DMCI, and number of synergies.
RESULTS: Difference between older and younger group was observed for one-synergy 
VAF, DMCI for forward stepping up task (one-synergy VAF difference of 2.45 
(0.22, 4.68) and DMCI of 9.21 (0.81, 17.61), p = 0.033), but not for lateral 
stepping up or walking.
CONCLUSION: The use of VAF based metrics and specifically DMCI, rather than 
number of MS, in combination with stepping forward exercise can provide a 
low-cost and easy to implement approach for assessing neuromuscular control in 
clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: Post-ACLR individuals can experience repeated exposure to variable 
limb loading, which contributes to development of knee osteoarthritis. Variable 
limb loading can present as loading rate variability (LRV) and is magnified 
during tasks like fast walking when the system is stressed. Nonlinear measures 
that evaluate temporal variability have successfully detected changes in gait 
variability associated with altered motor control, however, appropriately 
describing and uncovering the nature of gait variability has been challenging. 
Here, Poincaré analysis, a nonlinear method unique in its ability to capture 
different aspects of variability, served to uncover and quantify changes in limb 
LRV. It was hypothesized that post-ACLR individuals' overloaded limbs would 
quantitatively and graphically demonstrate greater short-term stride-to-stride 
and long-term limb LRV during fast walking compared to the underloaded and 
healthy control limbs.
METHODS: Fourteen post-ACLR individuals and fourteen healthy controls completed 
a walking protocol on an instrumented treadmill where they walked at 1.0 m/s and 
1.5 m/s for 5-minutes each. A Welch's test was performed to compare differences 
in short-term and long-term LRV metrics for the post-ACLR individuals' 
overloaded and underloaded limbs and the healthy controls' right limbs.
RESULTS: Analyses revealed that the post-ACLR individuals' overloaded limb 
exhibited significantly greater short-term and long-term values compared to the 
underloaded and healthy control limbs at 1.5 m/s (p<0.05). Additionally, the 
loading rate data was widely scattered across the plots for the overloaded limb, 
indicating greater LRV.
SIGNIFICANCE: Poincaré analysis successfully identified that post-ACLR 
overloaded limbs exhibited impaired motor control during fast walking based on 
quantitative and graphical changes in variability. This highlights the clinical 
applications of Poincaré analysis, with the plots potentially serving as an 
easy-to-interpret diagnostic tool for pathological limb LRV.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with cerebral-palsy commonly present with altered 
kinematics and selective-motor-control during gait, and may also experience 
musculoskeletal pain. This pilot study aims to investigate if the immediate 
experience of musculoskeletal pain during gait influences kinematics and 
selective-motor-control in individuals with spastic cerebral-palsy.
METHODS: Retrospective treadmill-based gait-analysis data for 145 individuals 
with spastic cerebral-palsy were screened. Participants were asked about 
experiencing lower-extremity musculoskeletal pain immediately during gait, with 
26 individuals (18%) reporting this was the case (pain-group; mean 
11.55 ± 3.15 years, Gross-Motor-Function-Classification-System levels I/II/III 
n = 5/13/8, Uni/bilateral involvement n = 11/15). Of the 77 individuals who did 
not report any pain, a no-pain group (n = 26) was individually matched. 
Kinematics were evaluated using the Gait-Profile-Score and spatiotemporal 
parameters (dimensionless-walking-speed, single-leg-support percentage and 
step-time). Selective-motor-control was assessed using the 
Walking-Dynamic-Motor-Control index.
FINDINGS: In the pain-group, 58% reported experiencing pain in their 
more-involved leg, 8% in the less-involved leg and 34% in both legs. Regarding 
the pain location, 38% of the pain-group reported experiencing pain in multiple 
locations. On a more specific level, 35%, 46% and 54% reported pain around the 
hip/thigh, knee/calf and ankle/ft, respectively. No significant differences were 
observed between the pain and no-pain groups for any of the outcome measures, in 
each leg or bilaterally.
INTERPRETATION: No significant differences in kinematics and 
selective-motor-control during gait were found between individuals with spastic 
cerebral-palsy, with and without musculoskeletal pain. This suggests that the 
individuals in this study may not present with obvious antalgic gait patterns, 
which may relate to the pre-existing altered kinematics and 
selective-motor-control.

This study compared the effect of continuous low-intensity aerobic exercise with 
blood flow restriction (LI-AE-BFR) versus high-intensity interval exercise 
(HIIE), matching total external mechanical work between conditions, on 
perceptual (exertion, pain, affective and pleasure) and physiological responses 
(heart rate [HR], blood lactate [BL] and muscle fatigue). Ten healthy untrained 
men (25.6 ± 3.78 years old; 75.02 ± 12.02 kg; 172.2 ± 6.76 cm; 24.95 ± 3.16 
kg/m²) completed three visits to the laboratory. In visit 1, anthropometry, 
blood pressure and peak running velocity on the treadmill were measured. In 
visits 2 and 3, participants were randomly assigned to HIIE or LI-AE-BFR, both 
in treadmill. HIIE consisted of 10 one-minute stimuli at 80% of peak running 
velocity interspersed with one-minute of passive recovery. LI-AE-BFR consisted 
of 20-minutes of continuous walking at 40% of peak running velocity with 
bilateral cuffs inflated to 50% of arterial occlusion pressure. BL and maximum 
isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC - fatigue measure) were measured pre- and 
immediately post-exercise. HR, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and rating of 
perceived pain (RPP) were recorded after each stimulus in HIIE and every two 
minutes in LI-AE-BFR. Affective response to the session, pleasure, and future 
intention to exercise (FIE) were assessed 10 minutes after the intervention 
ended. Increases in BL concentrations were greater in HIIE (p = 0.028; r = 
0.51). No effects time or condition were reported for MIVC. HR was higher in 
HIIE at all analyzed time points (p < 0.001; d = 3.1 to 5.2). RPE did not differ 
between conditions (p > 0.05), while average session RPP was higher in LI-AE-BFR 
(p = 0.036; r = 0.46). Affective positive response (p = 0.019; d = 0.9) and FIE 
(p = 0.013; d = 0.97) were significantly higher in HIIE. Therefore, HIIE 
elicited higher physiological stress, positive affective response, and intention 
to engage in future exercise bouts compared to LI-AE-BFR.

BACKGROUND: Persons with a transfemoral amputation (TFA) often experience 
difficulties in daily-life ambulation, including an asymmetrical and less stable 
gait pattern and a greater cognitive demand of walking. However, it remains 
unclear whether this is effected by the prosthetic suspension, as eliminating 
the non-rigid prosthetic connection may influence stability and cortical 
activity during walking. Spatiotemporal and stability-related gait parameters, 
as well as cortical activity during walking, were evaluated between highly 
active individuals (MFC-level K3-4) with a TFA and able-bodied (AB) persons, and 
between persons with a bone-anchored prosthesis (BAP) and those with a 
socket-suspended prosthesis (SSP).
METHODS: 18 AB persons and 20 persons with a unilateral TFA (10 BAP-users, 10 
SSP-users) walked on a treadmill at their preferred speed. Spatiotemporal and 
margin of stability parameters were extracted from three-dimensional movement 
recordings. In addition, 126-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. 
Brain-related activity from several cortical areas was isolated using 
independent component analysis. Source-level data were divided into gait cycles 
and subjected to time-frequency analysis to determine gait-cycle dependent 
modulations of cortical activity.
RESULTS: Persons with TFA walked with smaller and wider steps and with greater 
variability in mediolateral foot placement than AB subjects; no significant 
differences were found between BAP- and SSP-users. The EEG analysis yielded four 
cortical clusters in frontal, central (both hemispheres), and parietal areas. No 
statistically significant between-group differences were found in the mean power 
over the entire gait cycle. The event-related spectral perturbation maps 
revealed differences in power modulations (theta, alpha, and beta bands) between 
TFA and AB groups, and between BAP- and SSP-users, with largest differences 
observed around heel strike of either leg.
CONCLUSIONS: The anticipated differences in gait parameters in persons with TFA 
were confirmed, however no significant effect of the fixed suspension of a BAP 
was found. The preliminary EEG findings may indicate more active monitoring and 
control of stability in persons with TFA, which appeared to be timed differently 
in SSP than in BAP-users. Future studies may focus on walking tasks that 
challenge stability to further investigate differences related to prosthetic 
suspension.

A normative gait dataset of 246 healthy adults (122 men / 124 women, range in 
age 18-91 years, body weight 46.80-116.10 kg, height 1.53-1.97 m and BMI 
18.25-35.63 kg/m2) is presented and publicly shared for three walking speed 
conditions. Raw and processed data are presented for each subject separately and 
for each walking speed, including data of every single step of both legs. The 
subject demographics and results from the physical examination are also 
presented which allows researchers and clinicians to create a self-selected 
reference group based on specific demographics. Besides the data per individual, 
data are also presented in age and gender groups. This provides a quick overview 
of healthy gait parameters which is relevant for use in clinical practice. Three 
dimensional gait analysis was performed at the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation 
Environment (CAREN) at the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC+). 
Subjects walked on the instrumented treadmill surrounded with twelve 3D cameras, 
three 2D cameras and a virtual industrial environment projected on a 180° screen 
using the Human Body Lower Limb Model with trunk markers (HBM-II) as 
biomechanical model [1], [2]. Subjects walked at comfortable walking speed, 30% 
slower and 30% faster. These walking speed conditions were applied in a random 
sequence. Comfortable walking speed was determined using a RAMP protocol: 
subjects started to walk at 0.5m/s and every second the speed was increased with 
0.01 m/s until the preferred speed was reached. The average of three repetitions 
was considered the comfortable speed. For each walking speed condition, 250 
steps were recorded. The 3D gait data was collected using the D-flow CAREN 
software. For each subject, raw data of each walking speed condition is provided 
in .mox files, including the output from the model such as subject data (e.g. 
gender, body mass, knee and ankle width), center of mass (CoM), marker and force 
data, kinematic data (joint angles) and kinetic data (joint moments, ground 
reaction forces (GRFs) and joint powers) for each single step of both legs. 
Unfiltered and filtered data are included. C3D files with raw marker and GRF 
data were recorded in Nexus (Vicon software, version 2.8.1) and are available 
upon request. Raw data were processed in Matlab (Mathworks 2016), including 
quality check, step determination and the exportation of data to .xls files. For 
each adult and for each walking speed, an .xls file was created, containing 
spatiotemporal parameters, medio-lateral (ML) and back-forward (BF) margins of 
stability (MoS), 3D joint angles, anterior-posterior (AP) and vertical GRFs, 3D 
joint moments and 3D joint power of each step of both legs. Overview files per 
walking speed condition are created in .xls, presenting the averaged gait 
parameters (calculated as average over all valid steps) of every subject. The 
processed data is also presented and visualized per gender for different age 
groups (18-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years, ≥70 
years). This can serve as normative data for treadmill based 3D gait analyses in 
adults, applicable for clinical and research purposes. Data is available at 
OSF.io (https://osf.io/t72cw/).

When learning a new motor skill, people often must use trial and error to 
discover which movement is best. In the reinforcement learning framework, this 
concept is known as exploration and has been linked to increased movement 
variability in motor tasks. For locomotor tasks, however, increased variability 
decreases upright stability. As such, exploration during gait may jeopardize 
balance and safety, making reinforcement learning less effective. Therefore, we 
set out to determine if humans could acquire and retain a novel locomotor 
pattern using reinforcement learning alone. Young healthy male and female 
participants walked on a treadmill and were provided with binary reward feedback 
(indicated by a green checkmark on the screen) that was tied to a fixed monetary 
bonus, to learn a novel stepping pattern. We also recruited a comparison group 
who walked with the same novel stepping pattern but did so by correcting for 
target error, induced by providing real-time veridical visual feedback of steps 
and a target. In two experiments, we compared learning, motor variability, and 
two forms of motor memories between the groups. We found that individuals in the 
binary reward group did, in fact, acquire the new walking pattern by exploring 
(increasing motor variability). Additionally, while reinforcement learning did 
not increase implicit motor memories, it resulted in more accurate explicit 
motor memories compared with the target error group. Overall, these results 
demonstrate that humans can acquire new walking patterns with reinforcement 
learning and retain much of the learning over 24 h.

The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented increase in the usage of personal 
protective equipment (PPE) in the healthcare industry, especially in the form of 
face coverings. Subsequently, guidelines related to breathability and wear 
comfort were published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as an influx of 
various new materials entered the PPE market. This study evaluated a 
proprietary, novel, zinc-ion embedded fiber with the ability to deactivate 
bacteria and viruses, including SARS-COV-2, for its wear comfort in a nonwoven 
disposable mask in comparison to a commercially available surgical face mask 
which served as the control. Ten healthy, full-time, career, firefighters 
participated in this study wearing both masks in a randomized fashion. A medical 
task simulation (MTS) protocol was developed to replicate nursing task metabolic 
rates, per the compendium of physical activities, via a graded treadmill walking 
exercise. Participant ratings including ease of mask fit, overall mask comfort, 
facial comfort, breathability, and facial temperature sensation were recorded 
before, during, and after the 50-minute protocol in a controlled environmental 
chamber. The 100% nylon, zinc ion mask was rated as slightly cooler at the 
beginning of the trial (at 0.8 vs. 1.3), than the commercially available 
polypropylene mask. The polypropylene mask also reached a perceived mask facial 
comfort (MFC) rating of 1.6 just 35 min into the protocol whereas the zinc ion 
mask did not reach a rating of slight discomfort until the end of the exercise. 
Findings indicate the novel zinc-ion embedded mask was as comfortable, if not 
more so, than the commercially available nonwoven mask with more favorable 
ratings for longer durations. Not only do the zinc properties provide enhanced 
protection, but they maintain, if not improve, wearer comfort.

Spatial Contraction Based on Velocity Variation for Natural Walking in Virtual 
Reality.

Xu SZ, Huang K, Fan CW, Zhang SH.

Virtual Reality (VR) offers an immersive 3D digital environment, but enabling 
natural walking sensations without the constraints of physical space remains a 
technological challenge. Previous VR locomotion methods, including game 
controller, teleportation, treadmills, walking-in-place, and redirected walking 
(RDW), have made strides towards overcoming this challenge. However, these 
methods also face limitations such as possible unnaturalness, additional 
hardware requirements, or motion sickness risks. This paper introduces ""Spatial 
Contraction (SC)"", an innovative VR locomotion method inspired by the phenomenon 
of Lorentz contraction in Special Relativity. Similar to the Lorentz 
contraction, our SC contracts the virtual space along the user's velocity 
direction in response to velocity variation. The virtual space contracts more 
when the user's speed is high, whereas minimal or no contraction happens at low 
speeds. We provide a virtual space transformation method for spatial contraction 
and optimize the user experience in smoothness and stability. Through SC, VR 
users can effectively traverse a longer virtual distance with a shorter physical 
walking. Different from locomotion gains, the spatial contraction effect is 
observable by the user and aligns with their intentions, so there is no 
inconsistency between the user's proprioception and visual perception. SC is a 
general locomotion method that has no special requirements for VR scenes. The 
experimental results of our live user studies in various virtual scenarios 
demonstrate that SC has a significant effect in reducing both the number of 
resets and the physical walking distance users need to cover. Furthermore, 
experiments have also demonstrated that SC has the potential for integration 
with existing locomotion techniques such as RDW.

BACKGROUND: Data on walking impairment during the acute phase of deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT) are limited.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the degree of walking impairment in 
patients with acute DVT, with a particular focus on the relation to the DVT's 
anatomical location.
METHODS: Patients with sonographically confirmed DVT were eligible for inclusion 
in this cohort study. Pain-free walking distance (PWD) and maximum walking 
distance (MWD) were determined using standardized treadmill ergometer tests and 
analyzed in relation to DVT location. The impact of previous DVT on walking 
capacity was evaluated in an exploratory analysis.
RESULTS: The study included 64 patients (31% women; median age, 55 years). The 
median (IQR) time from diagnosis to exercise test was 3 (1-5) days. Patients 
with suprainguinal DVT demonstrated significantly shorter median (IQR) MWD than 
those with infrainguinal DVT (130 (61-202) m vs 565 (128-750) m; P < .01), while 
PWD did not significantly differ (PWD: 20 (0-30) m vs 40 (0-222) m; P = .14). 
The proportion of patients who had to terminate treadmill tests prematurely was 
higher in patients with suprainguinal DVT (91.7% vs 57.7%; P = .04). PWD and MWD 
seemed to be similar in patients with and without a history of DVT. Premature 
test termination and suprainguinal DVT location were associated with reduced 
quality of life, as measured by the EuroQoL Group 5-Dimension 5-Level 
questionnaire and visual analog scale.
CONCLUSION: Suprainguinal DVT was linked to a more pronounced walking impairment 
compared with infrainguinal DVT. Limited walking capacity was associated with a 
reduced quality of life.

PURPOSE: Understanding the test-retest reliability of physiological responses to 
load carriage influences the interpretation of those results. The aim of this 
study was to determine the test-retest reliability of physiological measures 
during loaded treadmill walking at 5.5 km h-1 using the MetaMax 3B.
METHODS: Fifteen Australian Army soldiers (9 male, 6 female) repeated two 12-min 
bouts of treadmill walking at 5.5 km h-1 in both a 7.2 kg Control condition 
(MetaMax 3B, replica rifle) and a 23.2 kg Patrol condition (Control condition 
plus vest) across three sessions, separated by one week. Expired respiratory 
gases and heart rate were continuously collected, with the final 3 min of data 
analysed. Ratings of Perceived Exertion and Omnibus-Resistance Exercise Scale 
were taken following each trial. Reliability was quantified by coefficient of 
variation (CV), intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), smallest worthwhile 
change (SWC), and standard error of the measurement.
RESULTS: Metabolic and cardiovascular variables were highly reliable (≤ 5% CV; 
excellent-moderate ICC), while the respiratory variables demonstrated moderate 
reliability (< 8% CV; good-moderate ICC) across both conditions. Perceptual 
ratings had poorer reliability during the Control condition (12-45% CV; poor 
ICC) than the Patrol condition (7-16% CV; good ICC).
CONCLUSIONS: The test-retest reliability of metabolic and cardiovascular 
variables was high and relatively consistent during load carriage. Respiratory 
responses demonstrated moderate test-retest reliability; however, as the SWC 
differed with load carriage tasks, such data should be interpreted independently 
across loads. Perceptual measures demonstrated poor to moderate reliability 
during load carriage, and it is recommended that they only be employed as 
secondary measures.

This proof of concept study presents a method to collect and analyse kinetic 
data from one participant with a transfemoral amputation fitted with a 
percutaneous osseointegrated implant walking on a level and sloped treadmill. We 
describe the construction of and results from a bespoke wireless six axis load 
cell built into one participant's prosthetic assembly. The load cell does not 
clinically compromise the participant in any way and is an initial milestone in 
the development of a light-weight wireless load cell for use with percutaneous 
osseointegrated implants. In this case, it is the first time that kinetic data 
from a participant fitted with an Intraosseous Transcutaneous Amputation 
Prosthesis has been published. We propose that the data can be used to model the 
load transfer to the host bone, with several clinically significant 
applications. The raw dynamic data are made available and quasi-static load 
cases for each functional phase of gait are presented. Peak forces obtained in 
the medio-lateral (X), cranio-caudal (Y) and antero-posterior (Z) axes over 
level ground respectively were -243.8 N (0.24 BW), 1321.5 N (1.31 BW) and -421.8 
N (0.42 BW); uphill were -141.0 N (0.14 BW), 1604.2 N (1.59 BW), -498.1 N (0.49 
BW); downhill were -206.0 N (0.20 BW), 1103.9 N (1.09 BW), -547.2 N (0.54 BW). 
The kinetics broadly followed able bodied gait patterns with some gait 
strategies consistent in participants with other implant designs or prosthetic 
socket connections, for example offloading the artificial limb downhill.

BACKGROUND: People with degenerative cervical myelopathy are known to have 
impaired standing balance and walking abilities, but less is known about balance 
responses during walking.
RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this project was to assess reactive balance 
impairments during walking in people with degenerative cervical myelopathy 
(PwDCM). We hypothesized that center of mass motion following perturbations 
would be larger in PwDCM and gluteus medius electromyographic amplitude 
responses would be decreased in PwDCM.
METHODS: Reactive balance responses were quantified during unanticipated lateral 
pulls to the waist while treadmill walking. Walking biomechanics data were 
collected from 10 PwDCM (F=6) and 10 non-myelopathic controls (F=7) using an 8 
camera Vicon System (Vicon MX T-Series). Electromyography was collected from 
lower limb muscles. Participants walked on an instrumented treadmill and 
received lateral pulls at random intervals and in randomized direction at 5% and 
2.5% body mass. Participants walked at 3 prescribed foot placements to control 
for effects of the size of base of support.
RESULTS: As compared with controls, the perturbation-related positional change 
of the center of mass motion (ΔCOM) was increased in PwDCM (p=0.001) with 
similar changes in foot placement (p>0.05). Change in gluteus medius 
electromyography, however, was less in PwDCM than in controls (p<0.001).
SIGNIFICANCE: After experimentally controlling step width, people with 
mild-to-moderate degenerative cervical myelopathy at least 3 months following 
cervical spine surgery have impaired reactive balance during walking likely 
coupled with reduced gluteus medius electromyographic responses. Rehabilitation 
programs focusing on reactive balance and power are likely necessary for this 
population.

Bilateral gait symmetry is an essential requirement for normal walking since 
asymmetric gait patterns increase the risk of falls and injuries. While human 
gait control heavily relies on the contribution of sensory inputs, the role of 
sensory systems in producing symmetric gait has remained unclear. This study 
evaluated the influence of vision as a dominant sensory system on symmetric gait 
production. Ten healthy adults performed treadmill walking with and without 
vision. Twenty-two gait parameters including ground reaction forces, joint range 
of motion, and other spatial-temporal gait variables were evaluated to quantify 
gait symmetry and compared between both visual conditions. Visual block caused 
increased asymmetry in most parameters of ground reaction force, however mainly 
in the vertical direction. When vision was blocked, symmetry of the ankle and 
knee joint range of motion decreased, but this change did not occur in the hip 
joint. Stance and swing time symmetry decreased during no-vision walking while 
no significant difference was found for step length symmetry between the two 
conditions. This study provides a comprehensive analysis to reveal how the 
visual system influences bilateral gait symmetry and highlights the important 
role of vision in gait control. This approach could be applied to investigate 
how vision alters gait symmetry in patients with disorders to help better 
understand the role of vision in pathological gaits.

Propulsive Force Modulation Drives Split-Belt Treadmill Adaptation in People 
with Multiple Sclerosis.

Most people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experience significant gait 
asymmetries between their legs during walking, leading to an increased risk of 
falls. Split-belt treadmill training, where the speed of each limb is controlled 
independently, alters each leg's stepping pattern and can improve gait symmetry 
in PwMS. However, the biomechanical mechanisms of this adaptation in PwMS remain 
poorly understood. In this study, 32 PwMS underwent a 10 min split-belt 
treadmill adaptation paradigm with the more affected (MA) leg moving twice as 
fast as the less affected (LA) leg. The most noteworthy biomechanical adaptation 
observed was increased peak propulsion asymmetry between the limbs. A kinematic 
analysis revealed that peak dorsiflexion asymmetry and the onset of 
plantarflexion in the MA limb were the primary contributors to the observed 
increases in peak propulsion. In contrast, the joints in the LA limb underwent 
only immediate reactive adjustments without subsequent adaptation. These 
findings demonstrate that modulation during gait adaptation in PwMS occurs 
primarily via propulsive forces and joint motions that contribute to propulsive 
forces. Understanding these distinct biomechanical changes during adaptation 
enhances our grasp of the rehabilitative impact of split-belt treadmill 
training, providing insights for refining therapeutic interventions aimed at 
improving gait symmetry.

Step by Step: Evaluation of Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Healthy Children, Young 
Adults, and Patients with Congenital Heart Disease Using a Simple Standardized 
Stair Climbing Test.

Hospital, LMU Munich, 81377 Munich, Germany.

(1) Background: Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is known to be a prognostic 
factor regarding long-term morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to develop 
a standardized Stair Climbing Test (SCT) with a reliable correlation to 
spiroergometry and the 6MWT which can be used in healthy children as well as 
patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) and a restricted exercise capacity. 
(2) Methods: A total of 28 healthy participants aged 10-18 years were included. 
We tested the individuals' CRF by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) on a 
treadmill, the 6MWT, and a newly developed Stair Climbing Test (SCT). For the 
SCT, we defined a standardized SCT protocol with a total height of 13.14 m to 
achieve maximal exercise effects while recording time and vital parameters. To 
compare the SCT, the 6 Min Walking Test, and CPET, we introduced an SCT-Index 
that included patient data (weight, height) and time. To assess the SCT's 
feasibility for clinical practice, we also tested our protocol with five 
adolescents with complex congenital heart disease (i.e., Fontan circulation). 
(3) Results: A strong correlation was observed between SCT-Index and O2 pulse (r 
= 0.921; p < 0.001). In addition, when comparing the time achieved during SCT 
(tSCT) with VO2max (mL/min/kg) and VO2max (mL/min), strong correlations were 
found (r = -0.672; p < 0.001 and r = -0.764; p < 0.001). Finally, we determined 
a very strong correlation between SCT-Index and VO2max (mL/min) (r = 0.927; p = 
<0.001). When comparing the 6MWD to tSCT, there was a moderate correlation (r = 
-0.544; p = 0.003). It appears to be feasible in patients with Fontan 
circulation. (4) Conclusions: We were able to demonstrate that there is a 
significant correlation between our standardized SCT and treadmill CPET. 
Therefore, we can say that the SCT can be used as an easy supplement to CPET and 
in certain contexts, it can also be used as a screening tool when CPET is not 
available. The advantages would be that the SCT is a simple, quick, 
cost-effective, and reliable standardized (sub)maximal exercise test to evaluate 
CRF in healthy children on a routine basis. We can even assume that it can be 
used in patients with congenital heart disease.

(1) Background: Despite evidence of increased rates of sports injury during the 
years surrounding peak growth in adolescents, little is known regarding the 
relationship between adolescent growth and gait stability. The aim of this study 
was to gain a better understanding of how chronological age and height relate to 
gait stability in both male and female adolescents. (2) Methods: Participants (N 
= 67; females: n = 34, ages 8.7-15.9 years; males: n = 33, ages 10.0-16.7 years) 
completed two trials of treadmill walking at varying speeds: the preferred 
walking speed and 30% above and below. Trials were separated by a bout of 
fatiguing exercises. HarmonicRatios of the trunk, calculated from acceleration 
signals taken during walking, were used to quantify gait stability. Data were 
separated by sex and relationships between height and chronological age, and 
HarmonicRatios were assessed using multiple linear regression. (3) Results: 
Females' HarmonicRatios improved with chronological age both before and after 
fatigue. Males' HarmonicRatios increased with chronological age before fatigue; 
however, this effect was eliminated post-fatigue. Females' height was negatively 
associated with HarmonicRatios post-fatigue. Males' height was positively 
associated with HarmonicRatios pre-fatigue. (4) Conclusions: The study findings 
suggest sex differences in the effects of fatigue on gait stability during 
adolescence. In both sexes, HarmonicRatios increased with chronological age. 
These improvements were eliminated for males and altered for females with 
fatigue. The results of this study indicate the need for the reevaluation of 
sports progression based on chronological age in adolescents.

BACKGROUND: Gait is the manner or style of walking, involving motor control and 
coordination to adapt to the surrounding environment. Knowing the kinesthetic 
markers of normal gait is essential for the diagnosis of certain pathologies or 
the generation of intelligent ortho-prostheses for the treatment or prevention 
of gait disorders. The aim of the present study was to identify the key features 
of normal human gait using inertial unit (IMU) recordings in a walking test.
METHODS: Gait analysis was conducted on 32 healthy participants (age range 19-29 
years) at speeds of 2 km/h and 4 km/h using a treadmill. Dynamic data were 
obtained using a microcontroller (Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2) with IMU 
sensors (BMI270). The collected data were processed and analyzed using a custom 
script (MATLAB 2022b), including the labeling of the four relevant gait phases 
and events (Stance, Toe-Off, Swing, and Heel Strike), computation of statistical 
features (64 features), and application of machine learning techniques for 
classification (8 classifiers).
RESULTS: Spider plot analysis revealed significant differences in the four 
events created by the most relevant statistical features. Among the different 
classifiers tested, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using a Cubic kernel 
achieved an accuracy rate of 92.4% when differentiating between gait events 
using the computed statistical features.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies the optimal features of acceleration and 
gyroscope data during normal gait. The findings suggest potential applications 
for injury prevention and performance optimization in individuals engaged in 
activities involving normal gait. The creation of spider plots is proposed to 
obtain a personalised fingerprint of each patient's gait fingerprint that could 
be used as a diagnostic tool. A deviation from a normal gait pattern can be used 
to identify human gait disorders. Moving forward, this information has potential 
for use in clinical applications in the diagnosis of gait-related disorders and 
developing novel orthoses and prosthetics to prevent falls and ankle sprains.

Exercise is a recommended part of phase IV cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR). 
The 1 km treadmill walk test (1-KTWT) is a submaximal continuous exercise test 
to predict cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with cardiovascular disease. We 
examined physiological, metabolic and subjective responses in patients with 
cardiovascular disease with self-selected, unchanging walking speed for two 
1-KTWTs. Fifteen men (age: 65 ± 9 yr, height: 174 ± 5 cm, body mass: 86 ± 17 kg, 
BMI: 28.5 ± 5.5 kg·m-2, body fat%: 27.7 ± 7.5%, 10 on beta-blockers) were 
recruited from phase IV CR groups in the United Kingdom. Participants 
established a self-selected walking speed for the 1-KTWT and performed the 
1-KTWT on separate days with recording of physiological responses to predict 
V˙O2peak with equations. For the two 1-KTWTs, no differences existed for walking 
speed, mean and maximal heart rates, oxygen uptake, predicted V˙O2peak (1st 
1-KTWT (range: 41-78% V˙O2peak, 95%CI, 53-65; 2nd 1-KTWT range: 43-78% V˙O2peak, 
95%CI, 52-65) and rating of perceived exertion. In phase IV cardiac patients, 
the 1-KTWT with self-selected, unchanging walking speed can be used for V˙O2peak 
prediction without the need for a full familiarisation. The self-selected 
constant walking speed for the first 1-KTWT can be used to support nonsupervised 
physical activity for phase IV CR patients.

BACKGROUND: Sensory-motor perturbations have been widely used to assess 
astronauts' balance in standing during pre-/post- spaceflight. However, balance 
control during walking, where most falls occur, was less studied in these 
astronauts. A study found that applying either visual or platform oscillations 
reduced the margin of stability (MOS) in the anterior-posterior direction 
(MOSap) but increased MOS in the medial-lateral direction (MOSml) as a tradeoff. 
This tradeoff induced an asymmetric gait. This study extended the current 
knowledge to investigate overall stability under unpredictable environments. 
This study aimed to determine (1) whether quasi-random treadmill perturbations 
with or without full vision support would result in a significant reduction in 
MOSap but an increase in MOSml and (2) regardless of whether vision support was 
provided, quasi-random treadmill perturbations might result in asymmetric gait 
patterns.
METHODS: Twenty healthy young adults participated in this study. Three 
experimental conditions were semi-randomly assigned to these participants as 
follows: (1) the control condition (Norm), walking normally with their preferred 
walking speed on the treadmill; (2) the treadmill perturbations with full vision 
condition (Slip), walking on the quasi-random varying-treadmill-belt-speeds with 
full vision support; and (3) the treadmill perturbations without full vision 
condition (Slip_VisionBlocked, blackout vision through customized vision-blocked 
goggles), walking on the quasi-random varying-treadmill-belt-speeds without full 
vision support. The dependent variables were MOSap, MOSml, and respective 
symmetric indices. A one-way repeated ANOVA measure or Friedman Test was applied 
to investigate the differences among the conditions mentioned above.
RESULTS: There was an increase in MOSap in Slip (p = 0.001) but a decrease in 
MOSap in Slip_VisionBlocked (p = 0.001) compared to Norm condition. The MOSml 
was significantly greater in both Slip and Slip_VisionBlocked conditions 
compared to the Norm condition (p = 0.011; p < 0.001). An analysis of Wilcoxon 
signed-rank tests revealed that the symmetric index of MOSml in 
Slip_VisionBlocked (p = 0.002) was greater than in the Norm condition.
CONCLUSION: The novelty of this study was to investigate the effect of vision on 
the overall stability of walking under quasi-random treadmill perturbations. The 
results revealed that overall stability and symmetry were controlled differently 
with/without full visual support. In light of these findings, it is imperative 
to take visual support into consideration while developing a sensory-motor 
training protocol. Asymmetric gait also required extra attention while walking 
on the quasi-random treadmill perturbations without full vision support to 
maintain overall stability.

BACKGROUND: Omnidirectional treadmills (ODTs) offer a promising solution to the 
virtual reality (VR) locomotion problem, which describes the mismatch between 
visual and somatosensory information and contributes to VR sickness. However, 
little is known about how walking on ODTs impacts the biomechanics of gait. This 
project aimed to compare overground and ODT walking and turning in healthy young 
adults.
METHODS: Fifteen young adults completed forward walk, 180° turn, and 360° turn 
tasks under three conditions: (1) overground, (2) on the Infinadeck ODT in a 
virtual environment without a handrail, and (3) on the ODT with a handrail. 
Kinematic data for all walking trials were gathered using 3D optical motion 
capture.
RESULTS: Overall, gait speed was slower during ODT walking than overground. When 
controlling for gait speed, ODT walking resulted in shorter steps and greater 
variability in step length. There were no significant differences in other 
spatiotemporal metrics between ODT and overground walking. Turning on the ODT 
required more steps and slower rotational speeds than overground turns. The 
addition of the stability handrail to the ODT resulted in decreased gait 
variability relative to the ODT gait without the handrail.
CONCLUSION: Walking on an ODT resembles natural gait patterns apart from slower 
gait speed and shorter step length. Slower walking and shorter step length are 
likely due to the novelty of physically navigating a virtual environment which 
may result in a more conservative approach to gait. Future work will evaluate 
how older adults and those with neurological disease respond to ODT walking.

Although humans are well-adapted to negotiating sloped terrain, balance recovery 
after a disturbance on slopes is poorly understood. This study investigated how 
slope affects recovery from unanticipated simulated trips and slips. Eighteen 
healthy young adults walked on a split-belt treadmill at 1.25 m/s and three 
slope angles (downhill: - 8°; level: 0°; uphill: + 8°), with slip- and trip-like 
perturbations applied randomly at heel-strike. We evaluated balance recovery 
using whole-body angular momentum (WBAM) and perturbation response (PR), for 
which larger PR values indicate greater deviation of the margin of stability 
from baseline, therefore, greater destabilisation after perturbation. Overall, 
trips were more destabilising than slips, producing larger PR and greater range 
and integral of WBAM across all tested slopes, most significantly in the 
sagittal plane. Contrary to expectation, sagittal-plane PR post-trip was 
greatest for level walking and smallest for downhill walking. Heightened 
vigilance during downhill walking may explain this finding. Recovery strategy in 
both frontal and sagittal planes was consistent across all slopes and 
perturbation types, characterized by a wider and shorter first recovery step, 
with trips requiring the greatest step adjustment. Our findings advance 
understanding of the robustness of human locomotion and may offer insights into 
fall prevention interventions.

BACKGROUND: Previous research on the accuracy of mobile measurement systems has 
focused on parameters related to the whole gait cycle. Specifically, bilateral 
gait characteristics were primarily used as outcome measures.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How accurate are unilateral gait characteristics detected 
using a mobile system at various fixed walking speeds?
METHODS: Gait analysis during treadmill walking at velocities (VEL) of 2.5 (v1), 
4.5 (v2) and 6.5 km/h (v3) was performed in a population of 47 healthy young 
adults, consisting of 27 females (age: 23 ± 2 years, BMI: 21.4 ± 2.2 kg/m²) and 
20 males (age: 22 ± 1 years, BMI: 23.3 ± 3.4 kg/m²). Spatiotemporal gait data 
were simultaneously determined using an instrumented treadmill (gaitway 3D) and 
a mobile gait analysis system (RehaGait). Besides VEL, bilateral (stride length 
[SL], cadence [CAD]) and unilateral (contact duration [CON], single [SS] and 
double support duration [DS]) outcomes were validated.
RESULTS: Across the three VEL investigated, the correlations between both 
measurement systems were almost perfect in SL and CAD (r > 0.97). In addition, 
SL significantly differed (p < 0.01) with moderate to large effects, whereby the 
root mean squared error (RMSE) did not exceed 1.8 cm. RMSE in CAD was not higher 
than 0.33 spm and statistically significant differences were only present at v1 
(d = 0.63). DS was the most erroneous unilateral parameter with values for %RMSE 
ranging from 9% at v1 to 14% at v3. In CON and SS %RMSE was in a magnitude of 
2-4% across all VEL. Furthermore, VEL affected measurement accuracy in 
unilateral outcomes with moderate to large effects (F (2, 45) > 6.0, p < 0.01, 
ηp2 > 0.11) with consistently higher differences at lower velocities.
SIGNIFICANCE: Based on the results presented the validity of the mobile gait 
analysis system investigated to detect gait asymmetries must be questioned.

BACKGROUND: Previous work suggests that proprioceptive information from ankle 
and hip are crucial in maintaining balance during upright standing; however, the 
contribution of these proprioceptive information during stepping balance 
recovery in not clear. The goal of the current study was to assess the role of 
ankle and hip proprioceptive information on balance recovery performance by 
manipulating type 1a afferent in muscle spindles using vibratory stimulation.
METHODS: Twenty healthy young participants were recruited (age = 22.2 ± 2.7 
years) and were randomly assigned to balance recovery sessions with either ankle 
or hip stimulation. Trip-like perturbations were imposed using a modified 
treadmill setup with a protecting harness. Vibratory stimulation was imposed 
bilaterally on ankle and hip muscles to expose participants to three condition 
of no-vibration, 40Hz vibration, and 80Hz vibration. Kinematics of the trunk and 
lower-extremities were measured using wearable sensors to characterize balance 
recovery performance. Outcomes were response time, recovery step length, trunk 
angle during toe-off and heel-strike of recovery stepping, and required time for 
full recovery.
FINDINGS: Ankle vibratory stimulation elicited main effects on reaction time and 
recovery step length (p < 0.002); reaction time and recovery step length 
increased by 23.0% and 21.2%, respectively, on average across the conditions. 
Hip vibratory stimulation elicited significant increase in the full recovery 
time (p = 0.019), with 55.3% increase on average across the conditions.
INTERPRETATION: Current findings provided evidence that vibratory stimulation 
can affect the balance recovery performance, causing a delayed recovery 
initiation and an impaired balance refinement after the recovery stepping when 
applied to ankle and hip muscles, respectively.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this registry study was to evaluate the progress of 
osteoarthrosis (OA) symptoms after the intake of a new standardized supplement 
combination (Pycnogenol® + Centellicum®, both Horphag Research) in a group of 
subjects with OA.
METHODS: Supplemented subjects took daily 150 mg Pycnogenol® + 450 mg 
Centellicum® for 6 months. Another comparable group of subjects using only 
standard management (SM) was included as a reference.
RESULTS: Forty-five subjects with a mean age of 42 years completed the study, 25 
in the supplemented group and 20 in the SM group. There were no safety problems 
or tolerability issues with the supplements. The two groups, SM and SM + 
Pycnogenol® + Centellicum® were comparable for age and clinical characteristics 
at inclusion. The two main ultrasound characteristics of cartilage, its 
thickness and surface-irregularity were more improved with the supplements. Pain 
scores, C reactive protein, the level of fitness and the use of extra pain 
killers (as rescue medication) were all significantly improved at 6 months with 
the supplement combination compared to SM (P<0.05). Plasma free radicals, 
pain-free walking distance on treadmill and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 
were significantly improved with the supplements compared to SM.
CONCLUSIONS: The morphological improvement - visible with ultrasound - 
correlates with a decrease in clinical symptoms and with a more efficient 
ambulation without pain. SM along with the Pycnogenol® Centellicum® combination 
are useful to avoid drug treatments that may expose patients to some side 
effects over time.

OBJECTIVES: To determine if adolescents with patellofemoral pain exhibit 
different biomechanical characteristics to asymptomatic adolescents during 
walking and running.
METHODS: Twenty-eight adolescents with patellofemoral pain (16 male, 12 female, 
mean [SD] age: 14.3 [1.7] years) and 24 asymptomatic adolescents (13 male, 11 
female, mean [SD] age: 14.1 [1.6] years) participated. Participants walked and 
ran on an instrumented treadmill in a standardized athletic shoe. Continuous 
hip, knee, and ankle joint angles and moments, and frontal plane pelvic motion 
were compared between groups using one-dimensional statistical parametric 
mapping independent t-tests (alpha <0.05). Cadence and stride length were 
compared between groups using independent t-tests.
RESULTS: During walking, adolescents with patellofemoral pain had a higher hip 
extension moment at 7%-8% of the gait cycle (p = 0.04) and walked with a shorter 
stride length (mean difference [95% confidence interval] = -0.07 [-0.1, -0.01] 
m). There were no other differences between groups during walking. During 
running, adolescents with patellofemoral pain had greater knee flexion than 
asymptomatic adolescents at 35%-40% of the gait cycle (p = 0.04) and ran with a 
higher cadence (mean difference [95% confidence interval] = 5.8 [2.0, 9.5] 
steps/min). There were no other statistically significant differences between 
groups during running.
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with patellofemoral pain demonstrate few biomechanical 
differences to asymptomatic adolescents during walking and running. The 
identified differences are likely of limited clinical importance. Biomechanical 
alterations which have been previously associated with patellofemoral pain in 
adults, may not need to be the target of management of adolescent patellofemoral 
pain.

Amherst, MA.

PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to assess the influence of ""super-shoes"" 
on metabolic cost and joint mechanics in competitive female runners and to 
understand how foot strike pattern may influence the footwear effects.
METHODS: Eighteen competitive female runners ran four 5-min bouts on a force 
instrumented treadmill at 12.9 km·h -1 in 1) Nike Vaporfly Next% 2™ (SUPER) and 
2) Nike Pegasus 38™ (CON) in a randomized and mirrored order.
RESULTS: Metabolic power was improved by 4.2% ( P < 0.001; d = 0.43) and 
metatarsophalangeal (MTP) negative work ( P < 0.001; d = 1.22), ankle negative 
work ( P = 0.001; d = 0.67), and ankle positive work ( P < 0.001; d = 0.97) were 
all smaller when running in SUPER compared with CON. There was no correlation 
between foot strike pattern and the between-shoe (CON to SUPER) percentage 
change for metabolic power ( r = 0.093, P = 0.715).
CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic power improved by 4.2% in ""super-shoes"" (but only by 
~3.2% if controlling for shoe mass differences) in this cohort of competitive 
female runners, which is a smaller improvement than previously observed in men. 
The reduced mechanical demand at the MTP and ankle in ""super-shoes"" are 
consistent with previous literature and may explain or contribute to the 
metabolic improvements observed in ""super-shoes""; however, foot strike pattern 
was not a moderating factor for the metabolic improvements of ""super-shoes."" 
Future studies should directly compare the metabolic response among different 
types of ""super-shoes"" between men and women.

The monitoring of treadmill walking energy expenditure (EE) plays an important 
role in health evaluations and management, particularly in older individuals and 
those with chronic diseases. However, universal and highly accurate prediction 
methods for walking EE are still lacking. In this paper, we propose an ensemble 
neural network (ENN) model that predicts the treadmill walking EE of younger and 
older adults and stroke survivors with high precision based on easy-to-obtain 
features. Compared with previous studies, the proposed model reduced the 
estimation error by 13.95% and 66.20% for stroke survivors and younger adults, 
respectively. Furthermore, a contactless monitoring system was developed based 
on Kinect, mm-wave radar, and ENN algorithms, and the treadmill walking EE was 
monitored in real time. This ENN model and monitoring system can be combined 
with smart devices and treadmill, making them suitable for evaluating, 
monitoring, and tracking changes in health during exercise and in rehabilitation 
environments.

PURPOSE: We aimed to examine the functional outcome in different walking 
conditions in elderly adults who underwent surgical repair after a non-contact 
hamstring injury. Our objective was to compare lower limb kinematics and 
kinetics over the entire gait cycle between the injured and contralateral leg in 
overground and level and uphill treadmill walking.
METHODS: 12 patients (mean ± SD, age: 65 ± 9 years; body mass index: 
30 ± 6 kg/m2) walked at self-selected speed in overground (0% slope) and 
treadmill conditions (0% and 10% slope). We measured spatiotemporal parameters, 
joint angles (normalised to gait cycle) and joint moments (normalised to stance 
phase) of the hip, knee and ankle. Data between sides were compared using paired 
sample t-tests (p < 0.05) and continuous 95% confidence intervals of the paired 
difference between trajectories.
RESULTS: Patients walked at an average speed of 1.31 ± 0.26 m/second overground 
and 0.92 ± 0.31 m/second on the treadmill. Spatiotemporal parameters were 
comparable between the injured and contralateral leg (p > 0.05). Joint kinematic 
and joint kinetic trajectories were comparable between sides for all walking 
conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Refixation of the proximal hamstring tendons resulted in comparable 
ambulatory mechanics at least 1 year after surgery in the injured leg and the 
contralateral leg, which were all within the range of normative values reported 
in the literature. These results complement our previous findings on hamstring 
repair in terms of clinical outcomes and muscle strength and support that 
surgical repair achieves good functional outcomes in terms of ambulation in an 
elderly population.

INTRODUCTION: Powered prosthetic feet require customized tuning to ensure 
comfort and long-term success for the user, but tuning in both clinical and 
research settings is subjective, time intensive, and the standard for tuning can 
vary depending on the patient's and the prosthetist's experience levels.
METHODS: Therefore, we studied eight different metrics of gait quality 
associated with use of a research-grade powered prosthetic foot in seven 
individuals with transtibial amputation during treadmill walking. We compared 
clinically tuned and untuned conditions with the goal of identifying 
performance-based metrics capable of distinguishing between good (as determined 
by a clinician) from poor gait quality.
RESULTS: Differences between the tuned and untuned conditions were reflected in 
ankle power, both the vertical and anterior-posterior impulse symmetry indices, 
limb-force alignment, and positive ankle work, with improvements seen in all 
metrics during use of the tuned prosthesis.
DISCUSSION: Notably, all of these metrics relate to the timing of force 
generation during walking which is information not directly accessible to a 
prosthetist during a typical tuning process. This work indicates that relevant, 
real-time biomechanical data provided to the prosthetist through the future 
provision of wearable sensors may enhance and improve future clinical tuning 
procedures associated with powered prostheses as well as their long-term 
outcomes.

Motor learning involves both explicit and implicit processes that are 
fundamental for acquiring and adapting complex motor skills. However, stroke may 
damage the neural substrates underlying explicit and/or implicit learning, 
leading to deficits in overall motor performance. While both learning processes 
are typically used in concert in daily life and rehabilitation, no gait studies 
have determined how these processes function together after stroke when tested 
during a task that elicits dissociable contributions from both. Here, we 
compared explicit and implicit locomotor learning in individuals with chronic 
stroke to age- and sex-matched neurologically intact controls. We assessed 
implicit learning using split-belt adaptation (where two treadmill belts move at 
different speeds). We assessed explicit learning (i.e., strategy-use) using 
visual feedback during split-belt walking to help individuals explicitly correct 
for step length errors created by the split-belts. The removal of visual 
feedback after the first 40 strides of split-belt walking, combined with task 
instructions, minimized contributions from explicit learning for the remainder 
of the task. We utilized a multi-rate state-space model to characterize 
individual explicit and implicit process contributions to overall behavioral 
change. The computational and behavioral analyses revealed that, compared to 
controls, individuals with chronic stroke demonstrated deficits in both explicit 
and implicit contributions to locomotor learning, a result that runs counter to 
prior work testing each process individually during gait. Since post-stroke 
locomotor rehabilitation involves interventions that rely on both explicit and 
implicit motor learning, future work should determine how locomotor 
rehabilitation interventions can be structured to optimize overall motor 
learning.

The soleus H-reflex modulation pattern was investigated during stepping 
following transspinal stimulation over the thoracolumbar region at 15, 30, and 
50 Hz with 10 kHz carry-over frequency above and below the paresthesia 
threshold. The soleus H-reflex was elicited by posterior tibial nerve 
stimulation with a single 1 ms pulse at an intensity that the M-wave amplitudes 
ranged from 0 to 15% of the maximal M-wave evoked 80 ms after the test stimulus, 
and the soleus H-reflex was half the size of the maximal H-reflex evoked on the 
ascending portion of the recruitment curve. During treadmill walking, the soleus 
H-reflex was elicited every 2 or 3 steps, and stimuli were randomly dispersed 
across the step cycle which was divided in 16 equal bins. For each subject and 
condition, the soleus M-wave and H-reflex were normalized to the maximal M-wave. 
The soleus background electromyographic (EMG) activity was estimated as the 
linear envelope for 50 ms duration starting at 100 ms before posterior tibial 
nerve stimulation for each bin. The gain was determined as the slope of the 
relationship between the soleus H-reflex and the soleus background EMG activity. 
The soleus H-reflex phase-dependent amplitude modulation remained unaltered 
during transspinal stimulation, regardless frequency, or intensity. Similarly, 
the H-reflex slope and intercept remained the same for all transspinal 
stimulation conditions tested. Locomotor EMG activity was increased in knee 
extensor muscles during transspinal stimulation at 30 and 50 Hz throughout the 
step cycle while no effects were observed in flexor muscles. These findings 
suggest that transspinal stimulation above and below the paresthesia threshold 
at 15, 30, and 50 Hz does not block or impair spinal integration of 
proprioceptive inputs and increases activity of thigh muscles that affect both 
hip and knee joint movement. Transspinal stimulation may serve as a 
neurorecovery strategy to augment standing or walking ability in upper 
motoneuron lesions.

BACKGROUND: A common gait retraining goal for runners is reducing vertical 
ground reaction force (GRF) loading rates (LRs), which have been associated with 
injury. Many gait retraining programs prioritize an internal focus of attention, 
despite evidence supporting an external focus of attention when a specific 
outcome is desired (e.g., LR reduction).
RESEARCH QUESTION: Does an external focus of attention (using cues for quiet, 
soft landings) result in comparable reductions in LRs to those achieved using a 
common internal focus (forefoot striking while barefoot)?
METHODS: This observational study included 37 injured runners (18 male; mean age 
36 (14) years) at the OMITTED Running Center. Runners wore inertial measurement 
units over the distal-medial tibia while running on an instrumented treadmill at 
a self-selected speed. Data were collected for three conditions: 1) Shod-Control 
(wearing shoes, without cues); 2) Shod-Quiet (wearing shoes, cues for quiet, 
soft landings); and 3) Barefoot-FFS (barefoot, cues for forefoot strike (FFS)). 
Within-subject variables were compared across conditions: vertical instantaneous 
loading rate (LR, primary outcome); vertical stiffness during initial loading; 
peak vertical GRF; peak vertical tibial acceleration (TA); and cadence.
RESULTS: Vertical LR, stiffness, and TA were lower in the Shod-Quiet compared to 
Shod-Control p < 0.001). Peak vertical GRF and cadence were not different 
between Shod-Quiet and Shod-Control. Reductions in stiffness and LR were similar 
between Shod-Quiet and Barefoot-FFS, and GRF in Barefoot-FFS remained similar to 
both shod conditions. However, runners demonstrated additional reductions in TA 
and increased cadence when transitioning from Shod-Quiet to the Barefoot-FFS 
condition (p < 0.05).
SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggests that a focus on quiet, soft landings may be 
an effective gait retraining method for future research.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of conventional rehabilitation 
(CR) and the combination of bodyweight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) with 
CR on walking speed, endurance, balance, mobility, and the quality of life in 
stroke survivors.
METHOD: In this prospective, randomized, controlled, and single-blind study, 30 
stroke patients were included (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: 
NCT04597658 date: October 22, 2020). These patients were divided into two 
groups: (1) CR only (control group, n = 14) and (2) CR with BWSTT (experimental 
group, n = 16). Both groups received CR for 3 consecutive weeks, 5 days a week, 
for 30 min each day. The experimental group received an additional 30 min of 
BWSTT per session. Patients were evaluated using the 10-m walk test (10MWT), the 
six-minute walk test (6MWT), the Tinetti Balance and Gait Assessment Score, the 
Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI), and the 
Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL) before and after the 
intervention.
RESULTS: Both groups showed significant improvements across all scales after the 
intervention. The BWSTT group exhibited particularly noteworthy enhancements in 
comfortable 10MWT and TUG scores (p = 0.043 and p = 0.025, respectively) 
compared to the CR group post-intervention.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a holistic approach combining conventional 
physiotherapy with overground gait training can enhance various aspects of 
mobility. This approach offers a cost-effective and equipment-free alternative 
to BWSTT and necessitates specialized treadmill and bodyweight support systems, 
incurring higher costs. However, using BWSTT as a co-therapy therapy can be 
costly but provides additional benefits for enhancing functional mobility.

PURPOSE: Strong observational evidence has linked changes in limb loading during 
walking following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) to 
posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). It remains unknown if manipulating peak 
loading influences joint tissue biochemistry. Thus, the purpose of this study is 
to determine whether manipulating peak vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) 
during gait influences changes in serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
(sCOMP) concentrations in ACLR participants.
METHODS: Forty ACLR individuals participated in this randomized crossover study 
(48% female, age = 21.0 ± 4.4 years, BMI = 24.6 ± 3.1). Participants attended 
four sessions, wherein they completed one of four biofeedback conditions 
(habitual loading (no biofeedback), high loading (5% increase in vGRF), low 
loading (5% decrease in vGRF), and symmetrical loading (between-limb symmetry in 
vGRF)) while walking on a treadmill for 3000 steps. Serum was collected before 
(baseline), immediately (acute post), 1 h (1 h post), and 3.5 h (3.5 h post) 
following each condition. A comprehensive general linear mixed model was 
constructed to address the differences in sCOMP across all conditions and 
timepoints in all participants and a subgroup of sCOMP Increasers.
RESULTS: No sCOMP differences were found across the entire cohort. In the sCOMP 
Increasers, a significant time × condition interaction was found (F9,206 = 2.6, 
p = 0.009). sCOMP was lower during high loading than low loading (p = 0.009) 
acutely (acute post). At 3.5 h post, sCOMP was higher during habitual loading 
than symmetrical loading (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that manipulating lower limb loading in ACLR 
patients who habitually exhibit an acute increase in sCOMP following walking 
results in improved biochemical changes linked to cartilage health. Key Points • 
This study assesses the mechanistic link between lower limb load modification 
and joint tissue biochemistry at acute and delayed timepoints. • Real-time 
biofeedback provides a paradigm to experimentally assess the mechanistic link 
between loading and serum biomarkers. • Manipulating peak loading during gait 
resulted in a metabolic effect of lower sCOMP concentrations in a subgroup of 
ACLR individuals. • Peak loading modifications may provide an intervention 
strategy to mitigate the development of PTOA following ACLR.

Investigating the fall recovery motion mechanism is crucial to prevent fall 
injuries. Among the various parameters of motion and posture, the forward moment 
can be considered the representative parameter of the magnitude of tripping from 
a kinematic perspective. The effect of increasing the forward moment on the 
recovery motion after tripping was investigated in this study. A tripping 
experiment was performed on a treadmill, and the recovery motion was observed. 
The forward moment was artificially increased using several approaches, such as 
pulling the torso, increasing gait speed, and increasing body mass. Factor 
analysis was performed to establish the relationship between the recovery motion 
parameters and forward moment. The distribution of the factor scores implied the 
uniqueness of the recovery motion of the pull condition. Although the forward 
moment temporarily increased, it was compensated quickly. The other conditions 
and factors indicated qualitative similarity of the recovery motion among the 
different conditions. This study demonstrates that the recovery motion after 
tripping is robust against an increase in forward moment, regardless of the 
method used to increase the forward moment. The investigation of reaction motion 
pattern enables validation of the recovery motion and falling posture 
estimation. Such fall simulations will facilitate the development of a method of 
fall prevention and mitigation.

Patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) have been shown to 
present balance disorders and a history of falling, which are associated with 
functional and daily life impairments. Although postural control improvement is 
an important outcome, the benefits of supervised exercise training (SET) on 
postural control have been seldom investigated in these patients. This article 
investigates the effects of SET on traditional measures of postural control and 
on stabilogram-diffusion analysis (SDA) parameters in patients with symptomatic 
PAD. Patients with symptomatic chronic lower limb claudication were 
investigated. All subjects who completed the 3-month multimodal SET program and 
postural control assessment before and after SET were included. Center of 
pressure trajectory analysis and SDA parameters were investigated using a 
posturographic platform. Patients were instructed to stand on the platform and 
maintain balance to their best ability. Treadmill pain-free (PFWD) and maximal 
(MWD) walking distances were also assessed prior and following SET. Forty-four 
patients with PAD (65.2 ± 9.8 years, 34% women) were investigated. All postural 
control parameters were unchanged following SET, except the length of center of 
pressure displacement as a function of the surface of center of pressure 
trajectory (LFS), which was significantly increased (before SET: 1.4 ± 0.4; 
after SET: 1.5 ± 0.5; p  = 0.042). PFWD (before SET: 103.5 ± 77.9 m; after SET: 
176.8 ± 130.6 m; p ≤ 0.001) and MWD (before SET: 383.6 ± 272.0 m; after SET: 
686.4 ± 509.0 m; p ≤ 0.001) significantly improved following SET. The increased 
LFS suggests a better postural control accuracy following SET in patients with 
symptomatic PAD.

OBJECTIVES: Commercially available wearable activity monitors can promote 
physical activity behaviour. Clinical trials typically quantify physical 
activity with research grade activity monitors prior to testing interventions 
utilising commercially available wearable activity monitors aimed at increasing 
step count. Therefore, it is important to test the agreement of these two types 
of activity monitors.
OBJECTIVES: Observational.
METHODS: Thirty adults (20-65 years, n = 19 females) were provided a Fitbit 
Charge 4©. To determine reliability using an intraclass correlation coefficient, 
two, one-minute bouts of treadmill walking were performed at a self-selected 
pace. Subsequently, participants wore both an ActiGraph wGT3X-BT and the Fitbit 
for seven days. To determine agreement, statistical equivalence and the mean 
absolute percentage error were calculated and represented graphically with a 
Bland-Altman plot. Ordinary least products regression was performed to identify 
fixed or proportional bias.
RESULTS: The Fitbit showed 'good' step count reliability on the treadmill 
(intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.75, 95 % CI = 0.53-0.87, p < 0.001). In 
free-living however, it overestimated step count when compared to the ActiGraph 
wGT3X-BT (mean absolute percentage error = 26.02 % ± 14.63). Measurements did 
not fall within the ± 10 % equivalence region and proportional bias was apparent 
(slope 95 % CI = 1.09-1.35).
CONCLUSIONS: The Fitbit Charge 4© is reliable when measuring step count on a 
treadmill. However, there is an overestimation of daily steps in free-living 
environments which may falsely indicate compliance with physical activity 
recommendations.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare physiological, 
perceptual and biomechanical outcomes between walking on a treadmill and 
overground surfaces. Five databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, Web 
of Science) were searched until September 2022. Included studies needed to be a 
crossover design comparing biomechanical, physiological, or perceptual measures 
between motorised-treadmill and overground walking in healthy adults 
(18-65 years) walking at the same speed (<5% difference). The quality of studies 
were assessed using a modified Downs and Black Quality Index. Meta-analyses were 
performed to determine standardised mean difference ± 95% confidence intervals 
for all main outcome measures. Fifty-five studies were included with 1,005 
participants. Relative oxygen consumption (standardised mean difference [95% 
confidence interval] 0.38 [0.14,0.63]) and cadence (0.22 [0.06,0.38]) are higher 
during treadmill walking. Whereas stride length (-0.36 [-0.62,-0.11]) and step 
length (-0.52 [-0.98,-0.06]) are lower during treadmill walking. Most kinetic 
variables are different between surfaces. The oxygen consumption, spatiotemporal 
and kinetic differences on the treadmill may be an attempt to increase stability 
due to the lack of control, discomfort and familiarity on the treadmill. 
Treadmill construction including surface stiffness and motor power are likely 
additional constraints that need to be considered and require investigation. 
This research was supported by an Australian Government Research Training 
Program (RTP) scholarship. Protocol registration is CRD42020208002 (PROSPERO 
International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) in October 2020.

Plain Language Summary: Relative oxygen consumption is greater on a treadmill 
when compared with overground when walking at similar speeds and needs to be 
considered when prescribing exercise.Walking on a treadmill results in several 
biomechanical changes compared to overground that may be related to changes in 
gait stability.It may be favourable for rehabilitation purposes for people to 
initially walk on a treadmill due to lower vertical ground reaction force at 
push-off and lower joint moments at the knee and ankle.

Tanji, F, Ohnuma, H, Ando, R, Yamanaka, R, Ikeda, T, and Suzuki, Y. Longer 
ground contact time is related to a superior running economy in highly trained 
distance runners. J Strength Cond Res 38(5): 985-990, 2024-Running economy is a 
key component of distance running performance and is associated with gait 
parameters. However, there is no consensus of the link between the running 
economy (RE), ground contact time, and footstrike patterns. Thus, this study 
aimed to clarify the relationship between RE, ground contact time, and thigh 
muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) in highly trained distance runners and to 
compare these parameters between 2 habitual footstrike patterns (midfoot vs. 
rearfoot). Seventeen male distance runners ran on a treadmill to measure RE and 
gait parameters. We collected the CSAs of the right thigh muscle using a 
magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The RE had a significant negative 
relationship with distance running performance ( r = -0.50) and ground contact 
time ( r = -0.51). The ground contact time had a significant negative 
relationship with the normalized CSAs of the vastus lateralis muscle ( r = 
-0.60) and hamstrings ( r = -0.54). No significant differences were found in RE, 
ground contact time, or normalized CSAs of muscles between midfoot ( n = 10) and 
rearfoot ( n = 7) strikers. These results suggest that large CSAs of knee 
extensor muscles results in short ground contact time and worse RE. The effects 
of the footstrike pattern on the RE appear insignificant, and the preferred 
footstrike pattern can be recommended for running in highly trained runners.

There has been much controversy over the effects of music tempo on movement 
flow. In this study, a single-factor repeated-measurement design was used to 
explore the effect of music tempo (fast, slow, and no music control) on movement 
flow by measuring both subjective experiences and objective 
electroencephalographic (EEG) characteristics during brisk walking. In the 
experiment, 20 college students walked briskly on a treadmill using EEG 
equipment. Each participant walked for 10 min on three different days. Their 
brain waves were recorded during brisk walking on a treadmill. After each walk, 
the participants completed a form of short flow state scale-2 (S FSS-2), which 
covered nine major aspects of flow. The results showed that music tempo had a 
significant effect on subjective experiences and objective physiological 
characteristics; that is, a higher subjective flow level for fast-tempo music in 
brisk walking and a significant enhancement of mean power values in the 
subconscious brain waves of the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands for fast 
tempo music were observed. A fast tempo facilitated the movement flow. The 
findings of this study can be instructive for the use of music in exercises to 
improve sports training outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: Improving ankle joint contracture is important because stiffness in 
ankle dorsiflexion can lead to pain, especially when weight-bearing during 
walking, which tends to concentrate on the forefoot. We hypothesized that the 
contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle in ankle dorsiflexion would increase the 
Achilles tendon length and improve the dorsiflexion range of motion. We 
evaluated the effects of walking with and without a gradient on Achilles tendon 
length.
METHODS: This study included 23 men who underwent ultrasound imaging to measure 
the Achilles tendon length while they stood on an inclined table adjusted 
according to the dorsiflexion angle. Treadmill walking was performed for 10 min 
with a 10° incline (gradient condition) or without gradient (level condition). 
The measurements were compared using a paired t-test.
RESULTS: In the gradient condition, the range of motion for ankle dorsiflexion 
was significantly increased after the intervention. In the gradient condition, 
the Achilles tendon length while standing on an inclined surface was 
significantly increased after the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Walking under gradient conditions led to the extension of the 
Achilles tendon in the ankle dorsiflexion position. This was accompanied by 
contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle, resulting in lengthening of the 
Achilles tendon. This finding suggests that such interventions may have clinical 
applications.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Motion analysis is crucial for effective and timely 
rehabilitative interventions on people with motor disorders. Conventional 
marker-based (MB) gait analysis is highly time-consuming and calls for expensive 
equipment, dedicated facilities and personnel. Markerless (ML) systems may pave 
the way to less demanding gait monitoring, also in unsupervised environments 
(i.e., in telemedicine). However,scepticism on clinical usability of relevant 
outcome measures has hampered its use. ML is normally used to analyse treadmill 
walking, which is significantly different from the more physiological overground 
walking. This study aims to provide end-users with instructions on using a 
single-camera markerless system to obtain reliable motion data from overground 
walking, while clinicians will be instructed on the reliability of obtained 
quantities.
METHODS: The study compares kinematics obtained from ML systems to those 
concurrently obtained from marker-based systems, considering different stride 
counts and subject positioning within the capture volume.
RESULTS: The findings suggest that five straight walking trials are sufficient 
for collecting reliable kinematics with ML systems. Precision on joint 
kinematics decreased at the boundary of the capture volume. Excellent 
correlation was found between ML and MB systems for hip and knee angles 
(0.92<R2<0.96), with slightly lower correlations observed for ankle 
plantar-dorsiflexion. The Bland-Altman analysis indicated the largest bias for 
hip flexion/extension ([0.2∘,10.9∘]) and the smallest for knee joint 
([0.1∘,0.8∘]) when comparing MB-PiG and MB-JC approaches. For MB-JC vs. ML-JC 
comparison, the largest bias was for the ankle joint ([1.2∘,11.8∘]), while the 
smallest was for the hip joint ([0.2∘,7.3∘]).
CONCLUSION: Single-camera markerless motion capture systems have great potential 
in assessing human joint kinematics during overground walking. Clinicians can 
confidently rely on estimated joint kinematics while walking, enabling 
personalized interventions and improving accessibility to remote evaluation and 
rehabilitation services, as long as: (i) the camera is positioned to capture 
someone walking back and forth at least five times with good visibility of the 
entire body silhouette; (ii) the walking path is at least 2 m long; and (iii) 
images captured at the boundaries of the camera image plane should be discarded.

BACKGROUND: Using medical gowns with high protection against COVID-19 among 
healthcare workers (HCWs) may limit heat exchange, resulting in physiological 
challenges.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the physiological and neurophysiological 
responses of female HCWs when using two typical medical gowns at different 
temperatures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Twenty healthy female HCWs participated in this study. Participants 
wore two types of medical gowns: Spunbond gown (SG) and laminate gown (LG). They 
walked on a treadmill in a controlled climate chamber for 30 minutes at three 
different temperatures (24, 28, and 32°C). Heart rate (HR), skin surface 
temperature (ST), clothing surface temperature (CT), ear temperature (ET), blood 
oxygen percentage (SaO2), galvanic skin response (GSR), and blood pressure were 
measured before and after walking on a treadmill. The study's results were 
analyzed using SPSS26.
RESULTS: The study found that LG led to an average increase of 0.575°C in CT 
compared to SG at the same temperatures (P < 0.03). The average HR increased by 
6.5 bpm in LG at 28°C compared to SG at a comfortable temperature (P = 0.01). 
The average ET in SG and GSR in LG at 32°C increased by 0.39°C and 0.25μS, 
respectively, compared to the comfortable temperature (P < 0.02).
CONCLUSION: The study recommends maintaining a comfortable temperature range in 
hospitals to prevent physiological challenges among HCWs wearing medical gowns 
with high protection against COVID-19. This is important because using LG, 
compared to SG, at high temperatures can increase HR, ET, CT, and GSR.

Gait adaptability is essential for stroke survivors to achieve efficient and 
safe community ambulation. However, conventional treadmill rehabilitation is 
only a repetitive practice of leg movement. This study compared the effects of 
augmented reality treadmill-based gait adaptation training with regular 
treadmill programs for patients with stroke. Forty patients with stroke (n = 40) 
were randomly assigned to the gait adaptation training {n = 20, age: 49.85 
[standard deviation (SD) 8.44] years; onset of stroke: 107.80 (SD 48.31) days} 
and regular training [n = 20, age: 50.75 (SD 8.05) years, onset of stroke: 
111.60 (SD 49.62) days] groups. Both groups completed three sessions of training 
per week for 5 weeks (15 sessions). The primary outcomes were the 10-m walk test 
and success rate of obstacle avoidance, while secondary outcomes included the 
Berg balance scale, component timed-up-and-go, and fall rate in a 6-month 
follow-up period. Assessments were performed before and after the intervention. 
The paired t-test was applied to compare the differences within groups and 
independent sample t-test was performed to compare the differences between 
groups. The 10-m walk test, success rate of obstacle avoidance, Berg balance 
scale, and component timed-up-and-go all significantly improved in the both 
groups (P < .001). The success rate of obstacle avoidance [P = .02, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): -21.07, -1.64], Berg Balance Scale (P = .02, 95% CI: 
-8.03, -0.67), 'turning around time' (P = .04, 95% CI: 0.08, 2.81), 
'stand-to-sit' (P = .03, 95% CI: 0.16, 2.41) and 'total time' (P = .048, 95% CI: 
0.04, 10.32) improved significantly in gait adaptation training group after 
intervention, while the 10-m walk test (P = .09, 95% CI: -0.17, 0.01), timed 
'sit-to-stand' (P = .09, 95% CI: -0.14, 2.04), and 'linear walking' (P = .09, 
95% CI: -0.27, 3.25) in gait adaptation training group did not show statistical 
difference compared to the regular training group. Total fall rate during the 
follow-up period was statistically decreased in the gait adaptation training 
group (P = .045). Both interventions improved mobility outcomes, with augmented 
reality treadmill-based gait adaptation indicating greater improvement in 
obstacle avoidance, balance, turning, and stand-to-sit. Augmented reality 
treadmill-based gait adaptation training emerges as an effective and promising 
intervention for patients with stroke in early rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: Treadmill belt-accelerations are a commonly utilised surrogate for 
tripping, but their physiological validity is unknown. This study examined if a 
treadmill belt-acceleration induces lower limb muscle activation responses 
similar to a trip on a walkway.
METHODS: 38 older people (65+ years) experienced one treadmill belt-acceleration 
and one walkway obstacle trip in random order. Muscle responses were assessed 
bilaterally using surface electromyography on the rectus femoris (RF), tibialis 
anterior (TA), semitendinosus (ST) and gastrocnemius medial head (GM). 
Unperturbed muscle activity, post-perturbation onset latency, peak magnitude, 
time to peak and co-contraction index (CCI) were examined.
RESULTS: Muscle activity in the right ST was greater during unperturbed walking 
on the treadmill compared to walkway (P=0.011). Compared to a treadmill 
belt-acceleration, a walkway trip elicited faster onset latencies in all 
muscles; greater peak magnitudes in the left RF, TA, GM and right GM; faster 
time to peaks in the left TA and right GM; and lower knee and ankle muscle CCI 
(P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Walkway trips and treadmill belt-accelerations elicit distinct 
muscle activation patterns. While walkway trips induced faster and larger muscle 
responses, treadmill belt-accelerations involved greater co-contraction. 
Therefore, treadmill belt-accelerations may not accurately simulate the muscle 
responses to trips.

A Kinematic Model to Predict a Continuous Range of Human-Like Walking Speed 
Transitions.

Murray GF, Martin AE.

While constant speed gait is well understood, far less is known about how humans 
change walking speed. It is also unknown if the transition steps smoothly morph 
between speeds, or if they are unique. Using data from a prior study in which 
subjects transitioned between five speeds while walking on a treadmill, joint 
kinematic data were decomposed into trend and periodic components. The trend 
captured the time-varying nature of the gait, and the periodic component 
captured the cyclic nature of a stride. The start and end of the transition were 
found by detecting where the trend diverged from a ±2 standard deviation band 
around the mean of the pre- and post-transition trend. On average, the 
transition started within half a step of when the treadmill changed speed ( p << 
0.001 for equivalence test). The transition length was 2 to 3 steps long. A 
predictive kinematic model was fit to the experimental data using Bezier 
polynomials for the trend and Fourier series for the periodic component. The 
model was fit using 1) only constant speed walking, 2) only speed transition 
steps, and 3) a random sample of five step types and then validated using the 
complement of the training data. Regardless of the training set, the model 
accurately predicted untrained gaits (normalized RMSE , normalized maximum error 
generally ). Because the errors were similar for all training sets, this implies 
that joint kinematics smoothly morph between gaits when humans change speed.

This study determined whether the acute cartilage response, assessed by 
cartilage thickness and echo intensity, differs between patients with early-mild 
knee osteoarthritis (OA) and healthy controls. We recruited 56 women 
aged ≥ 50 years with Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade ≤ 2 (age, 70.6 ± 7.4 years; 
height, 153.7 ± 5.2 cm; weight, 51.9 ± 8.2 kg). Based on KL grades and knee 
symptoms, the participants were classified into control (KL ≤ 1, asymptomatic, 
n = 27) and early-mild knee OA groups (KL 1 and symptomatic, KL 2, n = 29). 
Medial femoral cartilage thickness and echo intensity were assessed using 
ultrasonographic B-mode images before and after treadmill walking (15 min, 
3.3 km/h). To investigate the acute cartilage response, repeated-measures 
analysis of covariance (groups × time) with adjusted age, external knee moment 
impulse, steps during treadmill walking, and cartilage thickness at pre-walking 
was performed. A significant interaction was found at the tibiofemoral joint; 
after walking, the cartilage thickness was significantly decreased in the 
early-mild knee OA group compared to the control group (p = 0.002). At the 
patellofemoral joint, a significant main effect of time was observed, but no 
interaction was detected (p = 0.802). No changes in cartilage echo intensity at 
either the tibiofemoral or patellofemoral joints, and no interactions were noted 
(p = 0.295 and p = 0.063). As acute cartilage response after walking, the 
thickness of the medial tibiofemoral joint in the early-mild knee OA was 
significantly reduced than that in the control group. Thus, greater acute 
deformation after walking might be a feature found in patients with early-mild 
knee OA.

Age-related reductions in cognitive flexibility may limit modulation of control 
processes during systematic increases to cognitive-motor demands, exacerbating 
dual-task costs. In this study, behavioral and neurophysiologic changes to 
proactive and reactive control during progressive cognitive-motor demands were 
compared across older and younger adults to explore the basis for 
age-differences in cognitive-motor interference (CMI). 19 younger (19 - 29 years 
old, mean age = 22.84 +/- 2.75 years, 6 male, 13 female) and 18 older (60 - 77 
years old, mean age = 67.89 +/- 4.60 years, 9 male, 9 female) healthy adults 
completed cued task-switching while alternating between sitting and walking on a 
treadmill. Gait kinematics, task performance measures, and brain activity were 
recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) based Mobile Brain/Body Imaging 
(MoBI). Response accuracy on easier trial types improved in younger, but not 
older adults when they walked while performing the cognitive task. As difficulty 
increased, walking provoked accuracy costs in older, but not younger adults. 
Both groups registered faster responses and reduced gait variability during 
dual-task walking. Older adults exhibited lower amplitude modulations of 
proactive and reactive neural activity as cognitive-motor demands systematically 
increased, which may reflect reduced flexibility for progressive preparatory and 
reactive adjustments over behavioral control.

OBJECTIVE: Recent deep learning techniques hold promise to enable IMU-driven 
kinetic assessment; however, they require large extents of ground reaction force 
(GRF) data to serve as labels for supervised model training. We thus propose 
using existing self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to leverage large IMU 
datasets to pre-train deep learning models, which can improve the accuracy and 
data efficiency of IMU-based GRF estimation.
METHODS: We performed SSL by masking a random portion of the input IMU data and 
training a transformer model to reconstruct the masked portion. We 
systematically compared a series of masking ratios across three pre-training 
datasets that included real IMU data, synthetic IMU data, or a combination of 
the two. Finally, we built models that used pre-training and labeled data to 
estimate GRF during three prediction tasks: overground walking, treadmill 
walking, and drop landing.
RESULTS: When using the same amount of labeled data, SSL pre-training 
significantly improved the accuracy of 3-axis GRF estimation during walking 
compared to baseline models trained by conventional supervised learning. 
Fine-tuning SSL model with 1-10% of walking data yielded comparable accuracy to 
training baseline model with 100% of walking data. The optimal masking ratio for 
SSL is 6.25-12.5%.
CONCLUSION: SSL leveraged large real and synthetic IMU datasets to increase the 
accuracy and data efficiency of deep-learning-based GRF estimation, reducing the 
need for labeled data.
SIGNIFICANCE: This work, with its open-source code and models, may unlock 
broader use cases of IMU-driven kinetic assessment by mitigating the scarcity of 
GRF measurements in practical applications.

PURPOSE: To compare knee joint muscle activity during gait between the 
contralateral limb of individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and an 
asymptomatic older adult group. A secondary objective was to compare frontal and 
sagittal plane moment and sagittal plane motion features between groups.
SCOPE: 84 individuals with moderate knee OA (61 ± 6 years, 43 % female, BMI 
29.2 ± 5.7 kg/m2), and 45 asymptomatic older adults (61 ± 7 years, 49 % female, 
BMI 25.0 ± 3.4 kg/m2) participated. Participants walked at a self-selected pace 
on a dual belt treadmill. Surface electromyograms of the quadriceps, hamstrings, 
and gastrocnemius, segment motions and ground reaction forces were recorded. 
Principal component analyses identified amplitude and temporal electromyogram 
features. Sagittal plane motion and net external sagittal and frontal plane 
moments were calculated. Analysis of Variance models using Bonferroni 
corrections determined between and within group differences in these gait 
features.
CONCLUSIONS: The contralateral knee showed prolonged lateral hamstring 
activation and altered temporal features of the gastrocnemius and greater knee 
adduction moments compared to asymptomatic adults. Group, muscle, or interaction 
effects were not found for the quadriceps. These findings highlight the 
importance of exploring the implications of contralateral knee function of 
individuals with moderate knee OA, particularly considering the altered 
antagonist muscle activations, and heightened frontal plane moments.

BACKGROUND: Women have a higher risk of stroke and related disability than men 
but are underrepresented in stroke clinical trials. Identifying modifiable 
recruitment and enrollment barriers for women can improve study 
generalizability, statistical power, and resource utilization.
OBJECTIVE: In a post-stroke neuromodulation study, we determined the impact of 
sex on the occurrence of exclusion criteria and compared the sex distribution of 
screened and enrolled individuals with a broader stroke-affected population.
METHODS: A total of 335 individuals with chronic stroke were screened for a 
study examining how neuromodulation and high-intensity treadmill training affect 
walking speed and corticomotor excitability. Demographics and exclusions were 
retrospectively gathered as a secondary dataset. Exclusion criteria consisted of 
6 categories (not target population, unable to do treadmill protocol, unable to 
do non-invasive brain stimulation, insufficient ankle motion and disinterest, 
and cognitive impairment). Incidence of each exclusion criterion was compared 
between women and men. The sex distribution was compared to a dataset from 
Chicago primary stroke centers.
RESULTS: A total of 81 individuals were enrolled and 254 were not. The 
percentage of women excluded was significantly greater than that of men 
(P = .04). No individual exclusion criterion or categories excluded women more 
frequently than men. Screened and enrolled individuals had a lower proportion of 
women and younger age than a representative stroke population (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified exclusion criteria (ie, headaches, cognitive scores, 
and age) that are modifiable barriers to enrollment of women in this post-stroke 
neuromodulation study. Addressing underrepresentation of women in stroke 
research is pivotal for enhancing generalizability, achieving statistical power, 
and optimizing resources.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a common musculoskeletal pain disorder experienced 
by runners. While biomechanics of those with PFP have been extensively studied, 
methodological considerations may omit important adaptations exhibited by those 
experiencing and recovered from pain. Instead of a priori selection of discrete 
biomechanical variables, a data mining approach was leveraged to account for the 
high dimensionality of running gait data. Biomechanical data of runners 
symptomatic for, recovered from, and who had never experienced PFP were 
collected at the 1st (M1) and 21st (M21) minutes of a treadmill run. Principal 
component analysis and a logistic regression model were used to classify healthy 
and symptomatic runners, and a feature ranking process determined the important 
features. The M1 model achieved an accuracy of 82.76% with features related to 
knee flexion angle, hip abduction moment and gluteus maximus activation, while 
the M21 model required an additional nine features to achieve an accuracy of 
79.31%. Data for recovered runners were projected onto the models, resulting in 
five and seven out of twelve symptomatic classifications at M1 and M21, 
respectively. Following the onset of pain, a greater number of features were 
required to classify runners with PFP, suggesting they may experience individual 
pain adaptation strategies.

Although various measures have been proposed to evaluate dynamic balance during 
walking, it is currently unclear which measures are most sensitive to dynamic 
balance. We aimed to investigate which dynamic balance measure is most sensitive 
to detecting differences in dynamic balance during walking across various gait 
parameters, including short- and long-term Lyapunov exponents (λs and λl), 
margin of stability (MOS), distance between the desired and measured centre of 
pressure (dCOP-mCOP) and whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). A total of 10 
healthy young adults were asked to walk on a treadmill under three different 
conditions (normal walking, dual-task walking with a Stroop task as an unstable 
walking condition, and arm-restricted walking with arms restricted in front of 
the chest as another unstable walking condition) that were expected to have 
different dynamic balance properties. Overall, we found that λs of the centre of 
mass velocity, λs of the trunk velocity, λs of the hip joint angle, and the 
magnitude of the mediolateral dCOP-mCOP at heel contact can identify differences 
between tasks with a high sensitivity. Our findings provide new insights into 
the selection of sensitive dynamic balance measures during human walking.

BACKGROUND: Adult spinal deformity patients (ASD) experience altered spinal 
alignment affecting spatiotemporal parameters and joint kinematics. Differences 
in spinal deformity between patients with symptomatic idiopathic scoliosis 
(ID-ASD) and patients with ""de novo"" scoliosis (DN-ASD) may affect gait 
characteristics differently. This study aims to compare gait characteristics 
between ID-ASD, DN-ASD, and asymptomatic healthy matched controls.
METHODS: In this observational case-control study, ID-ASD (n = 24) and DN-ASD 
(n = 26) patients visiting the out-patient spine clinic and scheduled for 
long-segment spinal fusion were included. Patients were matched, based on age, 
gender, leg length and BMI, with asymptomatic healthy controls. Gait was 
measured at comfortable walking speed on an instrumented treadmill with 3D 
motion capture system. Trunk, pelvic and lower extremities range of motion (ROM) 
and spatiotemporal parameters (SPT) are presented as median (first and thirds 
quartile). Independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare ID-ASD, 
DN-ASD and controls. Statistical Parametric Mapping (independent t-test) was 
used to compare 3D joint kinematics.
RESULTS: DN-ASD patients walk with increased anterior trunk tilt during the 
whole gait cycle compared with ID-ASD patients and controls. ID-ASD walk with 
decreased trunk lateroflexion compared with DN-ASD and controls. DN-ASD showed 
decreased pelvic obliquity and -rotation, increased knee flexion, and decreased 
ankle plantar flexion. ID-ASD and DN-ASD displayed decreased trunk, pelvic and 
lower extremity ROM compared with controls, but increased pelvic tilt ROM. 
ID-ASD patients walked with comparable SPT to controls, whereas DN-ASD patients 
walked significantly slower with corresponding changes in SPT and wider steps.
CONCLUSIONS: DN-ASD patients exhibit distinct alterations in SPT and kinematic 
gait characteristics compared with ID-ASD and controls. These alterations seem 
to be predominantly influenced by sagittal spinal malalignment and kinematic 
findings in ASD patients should not be generalized as such, but always be 
interpreted with consideration for the nature of the ASD.

INTRODUCTION: The US Army Load Carriage Decision Aid (LCDA) metabolic model is 
used by militaries across the globe and is intended to predict physiological 
responses, specifically metabolic costs, in a wide range of dismounted 
warfighter operations. However, the LCDA has yet to be adapted for vest-borne 
load carriage, which is commonplace in tactical populations, and differs in 
energetic costs to backpacking and other forms of load carriage.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a metabolic model 
term that accurately estimates the effect of weighted vest loads on standing and 
walking metabolic rate for military mission-planning and general applications.
METHODS: Twenty healthy, physically active military-age adults (4 women, 16 men; 
age, 26 ± 8 yr old; height, 1.74 ± 0.09 m; body mass, 81 ± 16 kg) walked for 6 
to 21 min with four levels of weighted vest loading (0 to 66% body mass) at up 
to 11 treadmill speeds (0.45 to 1.97 m·s -1 ). Using indirect calorimetry 
measurements, we derived a new model term for estimating metabolic rate when 
carrying vest-borne loads. Model estimates were evaluated internally by k -fold 
cross-validation and externally against 12 reference datasets (264 total 
participants). We tested if the 90% confidence interval of the mean paired 
difference was within equivalence limits equal to 10% of the measured walking 
metabolic rate. Estimation accuracy, precision, and level of agreement were also 
evaluated by the bias, standard deviation of paired differences, and concordance 
correlation coefficient (CCC), respectively.
RESULTS: Metabolic rate estimates using the new weighted vest term were 
statistically equivalent ( P < 0.01) to measured values in the current study 
(bias, -0.01 ± 0.54 W·kg -1 ; CCC, 0.973) as well as from the 12 reference 
datasets (bias, -0.16 ± 0.59 W·kg -1 ; CCC, 0.963).
CONCLUSIONS: The updated LCDA metabolic model calculates accurate predictions of 
metabolic rate when carrying heavy backpack and vest-borne loads. Tactical 
populations and recreational athletes that train with weighted vests can 
confidently use the simplified LCDA metabolic calculator provided as 
Supplemental Digital Content to estimate metabolic rates for work/rest guidance, 
training periodization, and nutritional interventions.

BACKGROUND: Consumer and research activity monitors have become popular because 
of their ability to quantify energy expenditure (EE) in free-living conditions. 
However, the accuracy of activity trackers in determining EE in people with 
Huntington's Disease (HD) is unknown.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Can the ActiGraph wGT3X-B or the Fitbit Charge 4 accurately 
measure energy expenditure during physical activity, in people with HD compared 
to Indirect Calorimetry (IC) (Medisoft Ergo Card)?
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study with fourteen 
participants with mild-moderate HD (mean age 55.7 ± 11.4 years). All 
participants wore an ActiGraph and Fitbit during an incremental test, running on 
a treadmill at 3.2 km/h and 5.2 km/h for three minutes at each speed. We 
analysed and compared the accuracy of EE estimates obtained by Fitbit and 
ActiGraph against the EE estimates obtained by a metabolic cart, using with 
Intra-class correlation (ICC), Bland-Altman analysis and correlation tests.
RESULTS: A significant correlation and a moderate reliability was found between 
ActiGraph and IC for the incremental test (r = 0.667)(ICC=0.633). There was a 
significant correlation between Fitbit and IC during the incremental test 
(r = 0.701), but the reliability was poor at all tested speeds in the treadmill 
walk. Fitbit significantly overestimated EE, and ActiGraph underestimated EE 
compared to IC, but ActiGraph estimates were more accurate than Fitbit in all 
tests.
SIGNIFICANCE: Compared to IC, Fitbit Charge 4 and ActiGraph wGT3X-BT have 
reduced accuracy in estimating EE at slower walking speeds. These findings 
highlight the need for population-specific algorithms and validation of activity 
trackers.

BACKGROUND: Conventional balance and gait assessments for fall risk screening 
are often conducted under unperturbed conditions. However, older adults can 
allocate their attention to motor tasks (balance or walking) without revealing 
performance deficiencies, posing a challenge in identifying those with 
compromised gait and balance.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Do community-dwelling older adults exhibit greater changes 
in cognitive and/or walking performance under balance-challenging conditions 
compared to typical dual-task walking conditions?
METHODS: Twenty-nine healthy, community-dwelling older adults performed four 
cognitive tasks (visual and auditory Stroop tasks, Clock task, and Paced 
Auditory Serial Addition Test) while walking with and without lateral treadmill 
sways (Perturbed vs. Unperturbed) and during standing. We calculated dual-task 
costs (DTC) and walking perturbation effects (WPE) as the percentage of change 
in cognitive and walking performance between dual and single-task conditions and 
between Perturbed and Unperturbed conditions, respectively.
RESULTS: Older adults exhibited similar DTC and WPE on cognitive task 
performance. However, in walking performance, they demonstrated significantly 
greater WPE than DTC across all gait and stability measures (p < 0.01), 
including the mean and variability of stride and margins of stability (MOS) 
measures, the variability of trunk movement and lower-limb joint angles, and the 
local stability measures. Older adults took shorter but wider steps, exhibited 
shorter MOSAP but greater MOSML, and experienced increased movement variability 
and walking instability to a greater extent than during dual-task walking. 
Overall, changes in variability and stability measures were more pronounced than 
those in mean gait measures.
SIGNIFICANCE: Introducing destabilizing perturbations to increase the task 
demands of balance and gait assessments is a more effective method to challenge 
older adults compared to simply adding a concurrent cognitive task. Fall 
screening assessments for community-dwelling older adults should incorporate 
balance-challenging conditions, such as introducing gait perturbations.

Field hockey is characterized by a unique dribbling position which has been 
associated with a prevalence of low back pain and lumbar injury. To quantify the 
biomechanical response of the hockey-specific running gait, twelve field hockey 
players completed treadmill running at speeds of 6, 9 and 12 km·hr-1 with a 
normal running gait and whilst manipulating the hockey stick to replicate 
dribbling. Mechanical loading was quantified using tri-axial accelerometery at 
L4, and muscular activity was measured for biceps femoris (BF), gluteus medius 
(GM) and quadratus lumborum (QL) of each limb. Running with the stick elicited 
greater mechanical loading in the medio-lateral (p = 0.001) and antero-posterior 
(p = 0.003) planes, and increased peak (p = 0.004) and mean (p = 0.002) EMG 
response of QL (p = 0.004). The greater planar mechanical loading and QL 
activation in response to hockey-specific running technique support 
epidemiological observations of lower back pain prevalence. The sensitivity of 
uni-axial mechanical loading to the hockey-specific running posture provides an 
efficacious means of objectively monitoring mechanical loading in-vivo, whilst 
the QL activation response has implications for (p)rehabilitative interventions. 
Running posture and speed can be considered as discrete progressions when 
considering training load.

for Running.

The knee flexion angle is an important measurement for studies of the human 
gait. Running is a common activity with a high risk of knee injury. Studying the 
running gait in realistic situations is challenging because accurate joint angle 
measurements typically come from optical motion-capture systems constrained to 
laboratory settings. This study considers the use of shank and thigh inertial 
sensors within three different filtering algorithms to estimate the knee flexion 
angle for running without requiring sensor-to-segment mounting assumptions, body 
measurements, specific calibration poses, or magnetometers. The objective of 
this study is to determine the knee flexion angle within running applications 
using accelerometer and gyroscope information only. Data were collected for a 
single test participant (21-year-old female) at four different treadmill speeds 
and used to validate the estimation results for three filter variations with 
respect to a Vicon optical motion-capture system. The knee flexion angle 
filtering algorithms resulted in root-mean-square errors of approximately three 
degrees. The results of this study indicate estimation results that are within 
acceptable limits of five degrees for clinical gait analysis. Specifically, a 
complementary filter approach is effective for knee flexion angle estimation in 
running applications.

The efficiency of partial body weight-supported treadmill training (PBWSTT) for 
treating various conditions in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) 
in diverse contexts of rehabilitation, households, or schools is unknown. The 
major objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the 
effectiveness of PBWSTT on various outcomes in different contexts among children 
and adolescents with CP. We incorporated full-text, randomized controlled trial 
studies that specifically assessed the effects of PBWSTT walking, motor 
function, stride, balance, and endurance in children and adolescents aged 3 to 
18 years with CP. The literature search was carried out using Google Scholar, 
PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, Scopus, PEDro, and ResearchGate databases. 
The methodological quality was evaluated using a Cochrane risk of bias 
instrument. A meta-analysis of pooled data from 10 studies with 255 participants 
demonstrated that PBWSTT for 4-12 weeks in rehabilitation (mean difference [MD] 
= 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.40-2.48, p < 0.0001), at home or in a 
school context (MD = 13.5, 95% CI = 13.9-16.0, p < 0.0001), was significantly 
effective for treating various conditions in children and adolescents suffering 
with CP. The period of 4-12 weeks of PBWSTT in rehabilitation and at-home/school 
settings is effective on various outcomes in children or adolescents with CP.

Neuromechanical Adaptation to Walking With Electromechanical Ankle Exoskeletons 
Under Proportional Myoelectric Control.

Hybart RL(1), Ferris DP(1).

Gainesville FL 32611 USA.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if robotic ankle exoskeleton users decrease triceps 
surae muscle activity when using proportional myoelectric control, we studied 
healthy young participants walking with commercially available electromechanical 
ankle exoskeletons (Dephy Exoboot) with a novel controller. The vast majority of 
robotic lower limb exoskeletons do not have direct neural input from the user 
which makes adaptation of exoskeleton dynamics based on user intent difficult. 
Proportional myoelectric control has proven to allow considerable adaptation in 
muscle activation and gait kinematics in pneumatic, tethered ankle exoskeletons. 
In this study we quantified the changes in muscle activity and joint 
biomechanics of twelve participants walking for 30 minutes on a treadmill.
RESULTS: The exoskeletons provided 29% of the peak total ankle power and 18% of 
the peak total ankle moment by the end of the practice session. There was a 
decrease of 12% in soleus, 17% in lateral gastrocnemius and 5% in medial 
gastrocnemius electromyography (EMG) root mean square (root mean squared) after 
walking with the exoskeleton for 30 minutes compared to not wearing the 
exoskeleton, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were 
no differences in joint biomechanics of the ankle, hip, or knee between the end 
of training compared to walking without the exoskeletons.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to expectations, triceps surae muscle activity showed only 
small non-significant decreases in 30 minutes of walking with portable, 
electromechanical ankle exoskeletons under proportional myoelectric control. The 
commercially available ankle exoskeletons were likely too weak to produce a 
statistically meaningful decline in triceps surae recruitment. Future research 
should include a wider variety of tasks, including measurements of metabolic 
energy expenditure, and provide a longer period of adaptation to evaluate the 
ankle exoskeletons.

This study proposes a novel gait rehabilitation method that uses a hybrid system 
comprising a powered ankle-foot orthosis (PAFO) and FES, and presents its 
coordination control. The developed system provides assistance to the ankle 
joint in accordance with the degree of volitional participation of patients with 
post-stroke hemiplegia. The PAFO adopts the desired joint angle and impedance 
profile obtained from biomechanical simulation. The FES patterns of the tibialis 
anterior and soleus muscles are derived from predetermined electromyogram 
patterns of healthy individuals during gait and personalized stimulation 
parameters. The CNN-based estimation model predicts the volitional joint torque 
from the electromyogram of the patient, which is used to coordinate the 
contributions of the PAFO and FES. The effectiveness of the developed hybrid 
system was tested on healthy individuals during treadmill walking with and 
without considering the volitional muscle activity of the individual. The 
results showed that consideration of the volitional muscle activity 
significantly lowers the energy consumption by the PAFO and FES while providing 
adaptively assisted ankle motion depending on the volitional muscle activities 
of the individual. The proposed system has potential use as an assist-as-needed 
rehabilitation system, where it can improve the outcome of gait rehabilitation 
by inducing active patient participation depending on the stage of 
rehabilitation.

INTRODUCTION: The vestibular system, which encodes our head movement in space, 
plays an important role in maintaining our balance as we navigate the 
environment. While in-laboratory research demonstrates that the vestibular 
system exerts a context-dependent influence on the control of balance during 
locomotion, differences in whole-body and head kinematics between indoor 
treadmill and real-world locomotion challenge the generalizability of these 
findings. Thus, the goal of this study was to characterize vestibular-evoked 
balance responses in the real world using a fully portable system.
METHODS: While experiencing stochastic electrical vestibular stimulation (0-20 
Hz, amplitude peak ± 4.5 mA, root mean square 1.25 mA) and wearing inertial 
measurement units (IMUs) on the head, low back, and ankles, 10 participants 
walked outside at 52 steps/minute (∼0.4 m/s) and 78 steps/minute (∼0.8 m/s). We 
calculated time-dependent coherence (a measure of correlation in the frequency 
domain) between the applied stimulus and the mediolateral back, right ankle, and 
left ankle linear accelerations to infer the vestibular control of balance 
during locomotion.
RESULTS: In all participants, we observed vestibular-evoked balance responses. 
These responses exhibited phasic modulation across the stride cycle, peaking 
during the middle of the single-leg stance in the back and during the stance 
phase for the ankles. Coherence decreased with increasing locomotor cadence and 
speed, as observed in both bootstrapped coherence differences (p < 0.01) and 
peak coherence (low back: 0.23 ± 0.07 vs. 0.16 ± 0.14, p = 0.021; right ankle: 
0.38 ± 0.12 vs. 0.25 ± 0.10, p < 0.001; left ankle: 0.33 ± 0.09 vs. 0.21 ± 0.09, 
p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: These results replicate previous in-laboratory studies, thus 
providing further insight into the vestibular control of balance during 
naturalistic movements and validating the use of this portable system as a 
method to characterize real-world vestibular responses. This study will help 
support future work that seeks to better understand how the vestibular system 
contributes to balance in variable real-world environments.

Curved non-motorized treadmills do not biomechanically replicate overground 
running better than motorized treadmills.

The purpose of this study was to determine if curved non-motorized treadmills 
can reproduce overground running better than motorized treadmills by analysing 
the differences in joint kinematics (hip, knee, and ankle) using SPM. Nineteen 
recreational runners completed three randomized running tests on these surfaces. 
Kinematic data from the hip, knee, and ankle joints were collected. Two-tailed 
SPM t-tests were performed to analyse time-continuous gait cycles in three 
anatomical planes of each joint. Higher within-subject variability was observed 
in the frontal and transverse planes during curved non-motorized treadmill 
running. SPM analysis showed more significant differences (p < 0.05) between 
curved non-motorized treadmill and overground than between motorized treadmill 
and overground, mainly in knee (from 12% to 30% and 93% to 99% of the gait 
cycle) and ankle (from 19% to 23% of the gait cycle) in the sagittal plane. 
Therefore, running on curved non-motorized treadmills is more biomechanically 
different compared to overground than motorized treadmills, and might not be the 
best strategy to replicate overground running in terms of joint kinematics 
during highly controlled research studies. However, they could be an interesting 
tool in rehabilitation or training environments since the changes observed in 
joint kinematics were likely not functionally relevant.

IMU-Based Energy Expenditure Estimation for Various Walking Conditions Using a 
Hybrid CNN-LSTM Model.

In ubiquitous healthcare systems, energy expenditure estimation based on 
wearable sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) is important for 
monitoring the intensity of physical activity. Although several studies have 
reported data-driven methods to estimate energy expenditure during activities of 
daily living using wearable sensor signals, few have evaluated the performance 
while walking at various speeds and inclines. In this study, we present a hybrid 
model comprising a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory 
(LSTM) to estimate the steady-state energy expenditure under various walking 
conditions based solely on IMU data. To implement and evaluate the model, we 
performed level/inclined walking and level running experiments on a treadmill. 
With regard to the model inputs, the performance of the proposed model based on 
fixed-size sequential data was compared with that of a method based on 
stride-segmented data under different conditions in terms of the sensor 
location, input sequence format, and neural network model. Based on the 
experimental results, the following conclusions were drawn: (i) the CNN-LSTM 
model using a two-second sequence from the IMU attached to the lower body 
yielded optimal performance, and (ii) although the stride-segmented data-based 
method showed superior performance, the performance difference between the two 
methods was not significant; therefore, the proposed model based on fixed-size 
sequential data may be considered more practical as it does not require 
heel-strike detection.

Background and Objectives: The Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) is a short 
and simple tool to measure walking impairment for patients with peripheral 
arterial disease requiring no special equipment or trained staff. The aim of 
this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the culturally adapted 
Lithuanian WIQ version in patients with intermittent claudication. Materials and 
Methods: In total, 40 patients with intermittent claudication and ankle-brachial 
index < 0.90 participated in this study. Reliability and internal consistency of 
the questionnaire were assessed by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) 
and Cronbach's alpha (α), respectively. Validity was determined by correlations 
between the WIQ scores and a subjective test (Quality of Life 5 Dimension 
Questionnaire 3 Level Version (EQ-5D-3L)) and objective tests (6 min walk test 
(6MWT), treadmill test, and ankle-brachial index). Results: The test-retest 
reliability was assessed as excellent with an intraclass correlation coefficient 
of 0.90. The values of Cronbach's alpha were 0.957 (I time) and 0.948 (II time) 
and indicated an excellent internal consistency. Statistically significant 
Spearman correlations were detected between the WIQ and walking distances on the 
6MWT (rho 0.514, p < 0.001) and treadmill test (rho 0.515, p < 0.001). Higher 
WIQ scores were associated with longer walking distances and duration. Moderate 
negative and low negative correlations were found between the WIQ and EQ-5D-3L 
scores. Conclusions: The Lithuanian version of culturally adapted WIQ 
demonstrates reliability and validity for patients with intermittent 
claudication, supported by two different walking tests showing statistically 
significant moderate Spearman correlations.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity levels are low in people with Parkinson's disease 
(PD) and have proved difficult to increase with exercise programs alone. 
Intervention approaches that address both the capacity to engage in physical 
activity and self-management strategies to change and maintain exercise 
behaviours are needed to address this intractable issue.
METHODS: This will be an assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial performed 
in Brisbane, Australia. Ninety-two people with mild-moderate PD will be randomly 
allocated to two groups: usual care, and a physiotherapy-led group exercise 
program combined with self-management strategies. In the intervention group, 
twelve, 80-min sessions will be conducted over 4 weeks in groups of up to 4 
participants. The intervention will consist of circuit training including 
treadmill walking to target aerobic fitness, and activities targeting strength, 
balance, and gait performance. In addition, each session will also incorporate 
strategies focusing on self-management and behaviour change, augmented by the 
provision of a fitness activity tracker. Outcome measures will be collected at 
baseline (T1), immediately post intervention (T2) and at 6 months follow-up 
(T3). The primary outcome measure is free-living physical activity (average 
daily step count over 7 days) at pre (T1) and post (T2) intervention measured 
using an activPAL™ device. Secondary outcome measures captured at all time 
points include time spent walking, sedentary and in moderate intensity exercise 
over 7 days; spatiotemporal gait performance (step length, gait speed, 
endurance); health-related quality of life; and outcome expectations and 
self-efficacy for exercise.
DISCUSSION: Sustainability of gains in physical activity following exercise 
interventions is a challenge for most populations. Our incorporation of a 
chronic disease self-management approach into the exercise program including 
fitness tracking extends previous trials and has potential to significantly 
improve free-living physical activity in people with PD.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which arose in late 2019, caused 
extensive destruction, impacting a substantial proportion of the worldwide 
population and leading to millions of deaths. Although COVID-19 is mainly linked 
to respiratory and pulmonary complications, it has the potential to affect 
neurologic structures as well. Neurological involvement may manifest as minimal 
and reversible; however, a notable proportion of cases have exhibited pronounced 
neurological consequences, such as strokes. Endothelial inflammation, 
hypercoagulation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system alterations, and 
cardiogenic embolism are the pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke under 
COVID-19 circumstances. Physical activity and exercise have improved several 
aspects of post-stroke recovery, including cardiovascular health, walking 
capacity, and upper limb strength. They are commonly used to assist stroke 
survivors in overcoming their motor restrictions. Furthermore, stroke 
rehabilitation can incorporate a range of specific techniques, including 
body-weight-supported treadmill applications, constraint-induced movement 
therapy, robotic rehabilitation interventions, transcranial direct current 
stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and prism adaptation training. 
Under pandemic conditions, there were several barriers to neurological 
rehabilitation. The most significant of these were individual's fear of 
infection, which caused them to postpone their rehabilitation applications and 
rehabilitation areas being converted into COVID-19 units. The primary emphasis 
had turned to COVID-19 treatment. Several valuable data and views were gained in 
reorganizing rehabilitation during the pandemic, contributing to establishing 
future views in this regard.

Evoking muscle responses by electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) may help to 
understand the contribution of the vestibular system to postural control. 
Although paraspinal muscles play a role in postural stability, the 
vestibulo-muscular coupling of these muscles during walking has rarely been 
studied. This study aimed to investigate how vestibular signals affect 
paraspinal muscle activity at different vertebral levels during walking with 
preferred and narrow step width. Sixteen healthy participants were recruited. 
Participants walked on a treadmill for 8 min at 78 steps/min and 2.8 km/h, at 
two different step width, either with or without EVS. Bipolar electromyography 
was recorded bilaterally from the paraspinal muscles at eight vertebral levels 
from cervical to lumbar. Coherence, gain, and delay of EVS and EMG responses 
were determined. Significant EVS-EMG coupling (P < 0.01) was found at 
ipsilateral and/or contralateral heel strikes. This coupling was mirrored 
between left and right relative to the midline of the trunk and between the 
higher and lower vertebral levels, i.e. a peak occurred at ipsilateral heel 
strike at lower levels, whereas it occurred at contralateral heel strike at 
higher levels. EVS-EMG coupling only partially coincided with peak muscle 
activity. EVS-EMG coherence slightly, but not significantly, increased when 
walking with narrow steps. No significant differences were found in gain and 
phase between the vertebral levels or step width conditions. In summary, 
vertebral level specific modulation of paraspinal muscle activity based on 
vestibular signals might allow a fast, synchronized, and spatially co-ordinated 
response along the trunk during walking. KEY POINTS: Mediolateral stabilization 
of gait requires an estimate of the state of the body, which is affected by 
vestibular afference. During gait, the heavy trunk segment is controlled by 
phasic paraspinal muscle activity and in rodents the medial and lateral 
vestibulospinal tracts activate these muscles. To gain insight in 
vestibulospinal connections in humans and their role in gait, we recorded 
paraspinal surface EMG of cervical to lumbar paraspinal muscles, and 
characterized coherence, gain and delay between EMG and electrical vestibular 
stimulation, during slow walking. Vestibular stimulation caused phasic, 
vertebral level specific modulation of paraspinal muscle activity at delays of 
around 40 ms, which was mirrored between left, lower and right, upper vertebral 
levels. Our results indicate that vestibular afference causes fast, 
synchronized, and spatially co-ordinated responses of the paraspinal muscles 
along the trunk, that simultaneously contribute to stabilizing the centre of 
mass trajectory and to keeping the head upright.

Beneficial effects of natural environments on affect have been consistently 
reported, but effects on cognition have been less consistent. We examined affect 
and cognitive performance in the domains of attention, working memory, executive 
function, and recall and recognition memory in a sample of 188 undergraduate 
participants who completed a walk in one of three environments: an outdoor 
nature environment, an outdoor urban environment, or an indoor (treadmill) 
environment. Supporting the hypotheses, the outdoor nature environment resulted 
in the greatest increase in positive affect and decrease in negative affect from 
pre-to post-walk. However, there were no effects of location on any cognitive 
measure. These results suggest that cognitive effects do not always occur in 
tandem with affective benefits. Possible explanations, including prior frequent 
exposure to nature in our participants and extremity of the natural environment, 
are discussed.

Outdoor exercise is beneficial for psychophysical well-being. Limited studies 
have compared outdoor and virtual reality (VR) indoor physical activities, 
especially in coastal settings. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact 
of outdoor coastal walking and indoor walking in a VR simulation with a similar 
environment on physiological and psychological variables in healthy adults. A 
total of 26 subjects (14 M and 12 F, age 25.2 ± 2.5 years) voluntarily 
participated in this crossover randomized controlled and counterbalanced study 
and were allocated under three conditions: VR indoor walking (INVR), outdoor 
walking (OUT) and standard indoor walking (IN). IN and INVR conditions were 
performed on a treadmill (speed 4.5 km/h) and the OUT was performed on a seaside 
pedestrian road. The same outdoor environment was displayed in the visor during 
the INVR. Heart rate (HRmean/max), physical activity enjoyment (PACES-It) and 
state of mindfulness for physical activity (SMS-PA) were assessed at the end of 
each condition. The OUT condition showed significantly greater PACES-It scores 
and HRmean than IN and INVR (p < 0.001) and greater SMS-PA scores and HRmax than 
IN (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). No significant differences were found 
between OUT and INVR regarding HRmax and SMS-PA scores (p > 0.05). Findings 
suggest that physical activity in an immersive technology may lead to 
physiological loads comparable to the outdoor environment. OUT is more enjoyable 
than IN and INVR but exhibits a mindfulness response comparable to INVR. 
Therefore, INVR could be an alternative to OUT for those who cannot engage in 
outdoor activities for various reasons.

Achilles Tendon Loading during Running Estimated Via Shear Wave Tensiometry: A 
Step Toward Wearable Kinetic Analysis.

PURPOSE: Understanding muscle-tendon forces (e.g., triceps surae and Achilles 
tendon) during locomotion may aid in the assessment of human performance, injury 
risk, and rehabilitation progress. Shear wave tensiometry is a noninvasive 
technique for assessing in vivo tendon forces that has been recently adapted to 
a wearable technology. However, previous laboratory-based and outdoor 
tensiometry studies have not evaluated running. This study was undertaken to 
assess the capacity for shear wave tensiometry to produce valid measures of 
Achilles tendon loading during running at a range of speeds.
METHODS: Participants walked (1.34 m·s -1 ) and ran (2.68, 3.35, and 4.47 m·s -1 
) on an instrumented treadmill while shear wave tensiometers recorded Achilles 
tendon wave speeds simultaneously with whole-body kinematic and ground reaction 
force data. A simple isometric task allowed for the participant-specific 
conversion of Achilles tendon wave speeds to forces. Achilles tendon forces were 
compared with ankle torque measures obtained independently via inverse dynamics 
analyses. Differences in Achilles tendon wave speed, Achilles tendon force, and 
ankle torque across walking and running speeds were analyzed with linear 
mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: Achilles tendon wave speed, Achilles tendon force, and ankle torque 
exhibited similar temporal patterns across the stance phase of walking and 
running. Significant monotonic increases in peak Achilles tendon wave speed 
(56.0-83.8 m·s -1 ), Achilles tendon force (44.0-98.7 N·kg -1 ), and ankle 
torque (1.72-3.68 N·m·(kg -1 )) were observed with increasing locomotion speed 
(1.34-4.47 m·s -1 ). Tensiometry estimates of peak Achilles tendon force during 
running (8.2-10.1 body weights) were within the range of those estimated 
previously via indirect methods.
CONCLUSIONS: These results set the stage for using tensiometry to evaluate 
Achilles tendon loading during unobstructed athletic movements, such as running, 
performed in the field.

Speed alterations affect many gait analysis parameters. How horses adapt to 
speed is relevant in many equestrian disciplines and may differ between breeds. 
This study described changes in gait parameters in 38 Warmblood (WB) and 24 
Franches-Montagnes (FM) horses subjected to an incremental speed test at walk 
(1.35-2.05 m/s) and trot (3.25-5.5 m/s). Time, force and spatial parameters of 
each limb were measured with an instrumented treadmill and analysed with 
regression analysis using speed as the independent variable. With higher speeds, 
stride rate, length, over-tracking distance and vertical ground reaction forces 
increased while the impulses decreased. The parameters followed the same linear 
or polynomial regression curves independent of breed, while the slope (linear) 
or incurvation (polynomial) often differed significantly between breeds. Some 
differences between the breeds were associated with height and speed (e.g. 
stride length at walk), and would disappear when scaling the data. The main 
differences between the breeds seem to stem from the movement of the hind limbs, 
with the FM obtaining long over-tracking distances despite the shorter height at 
withers. Some parameters relevant to gait quality could be improved in the FM to 
resemble WB movement by strict selection using objective measurements systems.

BACKGROUND: Many people with chronic stroke (PwCS) exhibit walking balance 
deficits linked to increased fall risk and decreased balance confidence. One 
potential contributor to these balance deficits is a decreased ability to 
modulate mediolateral stepping behavior based on pelvis motion. This behavior, 
hereby termed mediolateral step modulation, is thought to be an important 
balance strategy but can be disrupted in PwCS.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Are biomechanical metrics of mediolateral step modulation 
related to common clinical balance measures among PwCS?
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 93 PwCS walked on a treadmill at their 
self-selected speed for 3-minutes. We quantified mediolateral step modulation 
for both paretic and non-paretic steps by calculating partial correlations 
between mediolateral pelvis displacement at the start of each step and step 
width (ρSW), mediolateral foot placement relative to the pelvis (ρFP), and final 
mediolateral location of the pelvis (ρPD) at the end of the step. We also 
assessed several common clinical balance measures (Functional Gait Assessment 
[FGA], Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale [ABC], self-reported fear of 
falling and fall history). We performed Spearman correlations to relate each 
biomechanical metric of step modulation to FGA and ABC scores. We performed 
Wilcoxon rank sum tests to compare each biomechanical metric between individuals 
with and without a fear of falling and a history of falls.
RESULTS: Only ρFP for paretic steps was significantly related to all four 
clinical balance measures; higher paretic ρFP values tended to be observed in 
participants with higher FGA scores, with higher ABC scores, without a fear of 
falling and without a history of falls. However, the strength of each of these 
relationships was only weak to moderate.
SIGNIFICANCE: While the present results do not provide insight into causality, 
they justify future work investigating whether interventions designed to 
increase ρFP can improve clinical measures of post-stroke balance in parallel.

Introduction: The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a well-established tool for 
assessing submaximal functional capacity for cardiac patients, but space 
limitations challenge its implementation. Treadmill-based (TR) 6MWT is a 
promising alternative, but it requires patients to complete a familiarization 
test to adapt treadmill speed regulation. With the advancement of sensors, it is 
possible to automatically control speed for individual patients and thus 
overcome the space limitation or the speed control difficulty on the treadmill 
for each patient.Methods: This study investigated the validity and 
interchangeability of automated speed TR6MWT and standard hallway (HL) 6MWT. 
Eighteen patients were assessed at baseline of the 12-week cardiac 
rehabilitation program. Fourteen of them were assessed after rehabilitation. All 
patients performed three TR6MWTs and three HL6MWTs at baseline and one of each 
test after the program.Results: Patients well tolerated the TR6MWT. There was a 
strong correlation between both test methods (r = 0.79). However, patients 
performed significantly better in HL6MWT (514.8m ± 59.7m) than in TR6MWT (447.2 
± 79.1m) with 95% CI, 40.4-94.6m, p < 0.05. Both tests showed high test-retest 
reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.86). The TR6MWT showed a 
valuable comparison of the effect of the cardiac rehabilitation program (20% 
increase, effect size 1.1) even though it is not interchangeable with the 
HL6MWT.Conclusion: The automated speed TR6MWT appears to be an acceptable tool 
with adequate validity, reliability, and responsiveness for assessing functional 
capacity in patients utilizing cardiac rehabilitation programs.

Human Gait Entrainment to Soft Robotic Hip Perturbation During Simulated 
Overground Walking.

Save OM, Das S, Carlson E, Ahn J, Lee H.

Entraining human gait with a periodic mechanical perturbation has been proposed 
as a potentially effective strategy for gait rehabilitation, but the related 
studies have mostly depended on the use of a fixed-speed treadmill (FST) due to 
various practical constraints. However, imposing a constant treadmill speed on 
participants becomes a critical problem because this speed constraint prohibits 
the participants from adjusting the gait speed, resulting in significant 
alterations in natural biomechanics as the entrainment alters the stride 
frequency. In this study, we hypothesized that the use of a variable-speed 
treadmill (VST), which enables the participants to continuously adjust their 
speed, can improve the success rate of gait entrainment and preserve natural 
gait biomechanics. To test this hypothesis, we recruited 15 young and healthy 
adults and let them walk on a conventional FST and a self-paced VST while 
wearing a soft robotic hip exosuit, which applied hip flexion perturbations at 
various frequencies, ranging from the preferred walking frequency to a 30% 
increased value. Kinematics and kinetics of the participants' walking under the 
two treadmill conditions were measured on two separate days. Experimental 
results demonstrated a higher success rate of entrainment during VST walking 
compared to FST walking, particularly at faster perturbation frequencies. 
Furthermore, walking on VST facilitated the maintenance of natural biomechanics, 
such as stride length and normalized propulsive impulse, better than walking on 
FST. The observed improvement, primarily attributed to allowing an increase in 
walking speed following the increase in the perturbation frequency, suggests 
that using a self-paced VST is a viable method for exploiting the potentially 
beneficial therapeutic effects of entrainment in gait rehabilitation.

Wearable exoskeletons show significant potential for improving gait impairments, 
such as interlimb asymmetry. However, a more profound understanding of whether 
exoskeletons are capable of eliciting neural adaptation is needed. This study 
aimed to characterize how individuals adapt to bilateral asymmetric joint 
stiffness applied by a hip exoskeleton, similar to split-belt treadmill 
training. Thirteen unimpaired individuals performed a walking trial on the 
treadmill while wearing the exoskeleton. The right side of the exoskeleton acted 
as a positive stiffness torsional spring, pulling the thigh towards the neutral 
standing position, while the left acted as a negative stiffness spring pulling 
the thigh away from the neutral standing position. The results showed that this 
intervention applied by a hip exoskeleton elicited adaptation in spatiotemporal 
and kinetic gait measures similar to split-belt treadmill training. These 
results demonstrate the potential of the proposed intervention for retraining 
symmetric gait.

Information Technology, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan 
(Y-JC).

OBJECTIVE: Verbal instruction is one of the most commonly used methods that 
therapists use to correct walking pattern for people with Parkinson disease. 
This study aimed to compare the long-term training effects of two different 
verbal instructions that either asked the participants to ""take big steps"" or 
""strike the ground with the heel"" on walking ability in individuals with 
Parkinson disease.
DESIGN: Forty-five participants with Parkinson disease were randomized into the 
big-step or heel strike group. The participants underwent 12 sessions of 
treadmill and overground gait training. Throughout the interventions, the 
big-step group received an instruction to ""take big steps,"" while the heel 
strike group received an instruction to ""strike the ground with your heel."" The 
primary outcome was gait performance, including velocity, stride length, 
cadence, and heel strike angle. The participants were assessed before, 
immediately after, and 1 mo after training.
RESULTS: Both groups showed significant improvements in gait performance after 
training. The heel strike group showed continuous improvements in velocity and 
stride length during the follow-up period; however, the big-step group showed 
slightly decreased performance.
CONCLUSIONS: A verbal instruction emphasizing heel strike can facilitate 
long-term retention of walking performance in people with Parkinson disease.

Numerous studies have evaluated the efficacy of interventions to improve 
locomotion after acute-onset brain injury, although most focus on patients with 
stroke, with less attention toward traumatic brain injury (TBI). For example, a 
number of studies in patients post-stroke have evaluated the effects of 
high-intensity training (HIT) attempting to maximize stepping practice, while no 
studies have attempted this intervention in patients with TBI. The purpose of 
this blinded-assessor randomized trial was to evaluate the effects of HIT 
focused on stepping practice versus conventional training on walking and 
secondary outcomes in individuals with TBI. Using a crossover design, ambulatory 
participants with TBI >6-months duration performed HIT focused on stepping in 
variable contexts (overground, treadmill, stairs) or conventional training for 
up to 15 sessions over five weeks, with interventions alternated >4 weeks later. 
HIT focused on maximizing stepping practice while trying to achieve higher 
cardiovascular intensities (>70% heart rate reserve), while conventional 
training focused on impairment-based and functional exercises with no 
restrictions on intensities achieved. Greater increases in 6-min walk test and 
peak treadmill speed during graded exercise testing were observed after HIT 
versus conventional training, with moderate associations between differences in 
stepping practice and outcomes. Greater gains were also observed in estimates of 
aerobic capacity and efficiency after HIT, with additional improvements in 
selected cognitive assessments. The present study suggests that the amount and 
intensity of stepping practice may be important determinants of improved 
locomotor outcomes in patients with chronic TBI, with possible secondary 
benefits on aerobic capacity/efficiency and cognition. Clinical Trial

BACKGROUND: The feasibility and safety of rehabilitation interventions for 
individuals recovering from COVID-19 after the acute stage is not well 
understood. This pilot study aims to provide a preliminary investigation of the 
feasibility and safety of providing high-intensity gait training (HIT) with a 
targeted cardiovascular intensity of 70-85% of the age-predicted maximum heart 
rate (HRmax) for individuals undergoing rehabilitation post-COVID-19.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who were medically cleared for HIT were invited to 
participate in the study. Participants practiced walking in varied contexts 
(treadmill, overground, and stairs), aiming to spend as much time as possible 
within their target cardiovascular intensity zone during scheduled physical 
therapy (PT) sessions. Training characteristics and adverse events were 
collected to determine the feasibility and safety of HIT. The severity of 
adverse events was graded on a 1-5 scale according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events.
RESULTS: The participants (n = 20) took a mean of 2093 (±619) steps per PT 
session. The average peak heart rate during PT sessions was 81.1% (±9.4) of 
HRmax, and 30.1% (±21.0) of the session time was spent at heart rates ≥ 70% 
HRmax. Mild adverse events (grade 1) occurred in <5% of the sessions, and no 
intervention-requiring or life-threatening adverse events (grade 2-5) occurred.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that HIT may be 
feasible and safe during inpatient rehabilitation for patients post-COVID-19 
following medical clearance.

BACKGROUND: Wearable robotic exoskeletons and leg braces are desirable for gait 
rehabilitation because they can apply loads directly to an affected joint. Yet, 
they are not widely used in clinics because they are costly and complex to set 
up. Conversely, tethered devices, such as elastic resistance bands, are widely 
available in clinics, are low-cost, and are quick to set up. However, resistance 
bands will affect walking differently based on how they are configured to pull 
on the leg (e.g., pulling forward or backward).
RESEARCH QUESTION: How can a resistance band be configured to alter muscle 
activation and gait biomechanics based on the segment it is attached to and the 
angle with which it attaches?
METHODS: We used an open-source musculoskeletal modeling platform to emulate 
several configurations of an elastic band pulling on the ankle, calf, and thigh 
at various angles during non-pathological walking. We evaluated gait 
biomechanics and simulated muscle activation using computed muscle control (CMC) 
and identified a subset of four configurations with potential applications for 
gait training. Eight non-pathological participants then walked on a treadmill 
under these configurations to verify how these configurations altered muscle 
activation.
RESULTS: We found that muscle activity greatly varied based on the location 
where the elastic band is attached and the angle with which the elastic band 
pulls on the leg. Notably, specific angles can be used to pull on the legs to 
elicit an increase or decrease in muscle activation.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides insight into how tethered devices can be 
configured to provide assistance or resistance during gait training. This 
information can be applied when developing low-cost gait training solutions for 
addressing individuals' impairments.

BACKGROUND: Balance perturbation studies during walking have improved our 
understanding of balance control in various destabilizing conditions. However, 
it is unknown to what extent balance recovery strategies can be generalized 
across different types of mediolateral balance perturbations.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Do similar mediolateral perturbations (foot placement versus 
surface translation) have similar effects on balance control and corresponding 
balance response strategies?
METHODS: Kinetic and kinematic data were previously collected during two 
separate studies, each with 15 young, healthy participants walking on an 
instrumented treadmill. In both studies, medial and lateral balance 
perturbations were applied at 80% of the gait cycle either by a treadmill 
surface translation or a pneumatic force applied to the swing foot. Differences 
in balance control (frontal plane whole body angular momentum) and balance 
response strategies (hip abduction moment, ankle inversion moment, center of 
pressure excursion and frontal plane trunk moment) between perturbed and 
unperturbed gait cycles were evaluated using statistical parametric mapping.
RESULTS: Balance disruptions after foot placement perturbations were larger and 
sustained longer compared to surface translations. Changes in joint moment 
responses were also larger for the foot placement perturbations compared to the 
surface translation perturbations. Lateral hip, ankle, and trunk strategies were 
used to maintain balance after medial foot placement perturbations, while a 
trunk strategy was primarily used after surface translations.
SIGNIFICANCE: Surface and foot placement perturbations influence balance control 
and corresponding response strategies differently. These results can help inform 
the development of perturbation-based balance training interventions aimed at 
reducing fall risk in clinical populations.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a subtype of 
osteoarthritis (OA). Exercise may produce and release the myokine irisin through 
muscle fiber contraction. However, the effect of exercise-promoted irisin 
production on the internal interactions of the muscle-bone unit in PTOA studies 
remains unclear.
METHODS: Eighteen 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 
three groups: Sham/sedentary (Sham/Sed), PTOA/sedentary (PTOA/Sed), and 
PTOA/treadmill-walking (PTOA/TW). The PTOA model was established by transection 
of anterior cruciate ligament (ACLT) and destabilization of medial meniscus 
(DMM). After 4 weeks of modeling, the PTOA/TW group underwent treadmill exercise 
(15 m/min, 30 min/d, 5 d/ week, 8 weeks), and the other two groups were free to 
move in the cage. Evaluation and correlation analysis of muscle, cartilage, 
subchondral bone and serological indexes were performed after euthanasia.
RESULTS: Eight weeks of treadmill exercise effectively alleviated the 
trauma-induced OA phenotype, thereby maintaining cartilage and subchondral bone 
integrity in PTOA, and reducing quadriceps atrophy and myofibril degradation. 
Exercise reversed the down-regulated expression of peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and fibronectin 
type III structural domain protein 5 (FNDC5) in muscle tissue of PTOA rats, and 
increased the blood irisin level, and the irisin level was positively correlated 
with the expression of PGC-1α and FNDC5. In addition, correlation analysis 
showed that irisin metabolism level was strongly negatively correlated with 
Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) and subchondral bone loss, 
indicating that irisin may be involved in cartilage biology and PTOA-related 
changes in cartilage and subchondral bone. Moreover, the metabolic level of 
irisin was strongly negatively correlated with muscle fiber cross-sectional area 
(CSA), Atrogin-1 and muscle ring-finger protein-1(MuRF-1) expression, suggesting 
that irisin may alleviate muscle atrophy through autocrine action.
CONCLUSION: Treadmill exercise can alleviate the atrophy and degeneration of 
muscle fibers in PTOA rats, reduce the degradation of muscle fibrin, promote the 
expression of serum irisin, and alleviate the degeneration of articular 
cartilage and subchondral bone loss in PTOA rats. These results indicate that 
treadmill exercise can affect the process of PTOA by promoting the expression of 
myokine irisin in rat muscle-bone unit.

INTRODUCTION: It is uncertain whether aerobic exercise in the form of walking 
contributes to the preservation or increase in total or regional skeletal muscle 
mass (SMM).
PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the effects of aerobic exercise on total 
and regional (upper body verses leg SMM) in male ( n = 105) and female ( n = 
133) adults with overweight and obesity.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data from four randomized controlled 
trials. Participants included those who completed the given trial (control, n = 
63; intervention, n = 175) and with complete magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
measured adipose tissue and SMM pre- and postintervention. Macronutrient intake 
was assessed for a subsample of participants. Supervised exercise was performed 
by walking on a treadmill for durations ranging from 12 to 24 wk at intensities 
between 50% and 75% of V̇O 2peak .
RESULTS: All MRI-measured adipose tissue depots were reduced, and 
cardiorespiratory fitness was increased by aerobic exercise compared with 
controls ( P < 0.001). Independent of baseline SMM, aerobic exercise was 
associated with a small reduction (estimated mean difference ± standard error) 
in whole-body SMM (-0.310 ± 0.150 kg, P = 0.039) and upper body SMM (-0.273 ± 
0.121 kg, P = 0.025) compared with control. No between-group difference was 
observed for change in leg SMM ( P > 0.10). A negative association was observed 
between the relative change in body weight and change in total ( R2 = 0.37, P < 
0.001), upper body ( R2 = 0.21, P < 0.001), and leg SMM ( R2 = 0.09, P = 0.701). 
The SMM-to-adipose tissue ratio increased in response to aerobic exercise and 
was positively associated with weight loss ( P < 0.001). Change in SMM was not 
associated with dietary protein intake ( P > 0.10).
CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise performed while walking preserves, but does not 
increase, SMM in exercising muscle of adults. SMM not directly targeted by 
aerobic exercise may not be maintained.

The purpose of this study was to analyse the differences in joint kinematic 
patterns among runners with different spatiotemporal characteristics in the 
running cycle. Lower extremity kinematic data and spatiotemporal stride 
parameters were collected for ninety-two recreational runners during a treadmill 
run at a self-selected comfortable speed. A K-means clustering analysis was 
conducted on normalised stride cadence and Duty Factor to identify running 
style. Cluster 1 characterised by reduced stance times and low Duty Factor; 
Cluster 2, long stance times and low stride cadence; Cluster 3, high Duty Factor 
and stride cadence. Functional principal component analysis was used to identify 
patterns of variability between runners. Runners who used a combination of high 
cadence and Duty Factor showed differences in hip, knee and ankle sagittal 
kinematics compared to other runners. On the contrary, the joint kinematics was 
not altered when the Duty Factor was increased along with a decrease in the 
stride cadence. This study has demonstrated that the combination of several 
spatial-temporal parameters of the running cycle should be considered when 
analysing the movement pattern of the lower limb.

This paper describes the development and evaluation of a novel, threshold-based 
gait event detection algorithm utilizing only one thigh inertial measurement 
unit (IMU) and unilateral, sagittal plane hip and knee joint angles. The 
algorithm was designed to detect heel strike (HS) and toe off (TO) gait events, 
with the eventual goal of detection in a real-time exoskeletal control system. 
The data used in the development and evaluation of the algorithm were obtained 
from two gait databases, each containing synchronized IMU and ground reaction 
force (GRF) data. All database subjects were healthy individuals walking in 
either a level-ground, urban environment or a treadmill lab environment. 
Inertial measurements used were three-dimensional thigh accelerations and 
three-dimensional thigh angular velocities. Parameters for the TO algorithm were 
identified on a per-subject basis. The GRF data were utilized to validate the 
algorithm's timing accuracy and quantify the fidelity of the algorithm, measured 
by the F1-Score. Across all participants, the algorithm reported a mean timing 
error of -41±20 ms with an F1-Score of 0.988 for HS. For TO, the algorithm 
reported a mean timing error of -1.4±21 ms with an F1-Score of 0.991. The 
results of this evaluation suggest that this algorithm is a promising solution 
to inertial based gait event detection; however, further refinement and 
real-time evaluation are required for use in exoskeletal control.

Factors affecting the efficiency of walking independence in patients with 
subacute stroke following robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) and conventional 
treatment (RAGT-CT) were examined. This retrospective cohort study included 37 
patients with stroke [ n  = 11 ischemic; n  = 26 hemorrhagic; median poststroke 
interval, 28 days (interquartile range, IQR, 24-42)] who underwent RAGT using 
Welwalk for a median of 3 weeks (IQR, 2-4) followed by conventional training 
(median, 129 days; IQR, 114-146). The primary outcome was the change in 
functional independence measure (FIM)-walk item score from before to after RAGT 
(FIM-walk efficiency). The secondary outcome was the FIM-walk score at 
discharge. The independent variables included sensorimotor function [lower 
extremity (LE) motor and sensory scores and trunk function from the Stroke 
Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS) and Berg Balance Scale (BBS)] and cognitive 
function (FIM-cognitive, MMSE and Cognitive-related Behavioral Assessment) 
before RAGT-CT and RAGT dose duration per session, total steps and average 
treadmill speed at week 1, and number of sessions). We first determined the 
bivariate associations of each independent variable with the FIM-walk efficiency 
at the end of the RAGT period as decided by the therapists and with the FIM-walk 
score at discharge. Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that only the 
FIM-cognitive score was a significant predictor of the FIM-walk efficiency at 
the end of the RAGT period ( β  = 0.47; P  < 0.01, adjusted R2  = 0.21) after 
accounting for age, days post-stroke, SIAS-total lower extremity (SIAS-LE) motor 
score, and number of RAGT sessions (all nonsignificant). Furthermore, only the 
SIAS-trunk score was a significant predictor of the FIM-walk score at discharge 
( β  = 0.52; P  < 0.01; adjusted R2  = 0.65) after accounting for age, days 
post-stroke, FIM-cognitive score, SIAS-LE motor score, and average treadmill 
speed at week 1 (all nonsignificant). Although patients with better cognition at 
the start of locomotor training achieved the pragmatic targets for terminating 
RAGT and proceeding with conventional therapy at a faster rate, the outcome at 
discharge is mainly dependent on early trunk function.

BACKGROUND: Walking speed and energy economy tend to decline with age. 
Lower-limb exoskeletons have demonstrated potential to improve either measure, 
but primarily in studies conducted on healthy younger adults. Promising 
techniques like optimization of exoskeleton assistance have yet to be tested 
with older populations, while speed and energy consumption have yet to be 
simultaneously optimized for any population.
METHODS: We investigated the effectiveness of human-in-the-loop optimization of 
ankle exoskeletons with older adults. Ten healthy adults > 65 years of age (5 
females; mean age: 72 ± 3 yrs) participated in approximately 240 min of training 
and optimization with tethered ankle exoskeletons on a self-paced treadmill. 
Multi-objective human-in-the-loop optimization was used to identify assistive 
ankle plantarflexion torque patterns that simultaneously improved self-selected 
walking speed and metabolic rate. The effects of optimized exoskeleton 
assistance were evaluated in separate trials.
RESULTS: Optimized exoskeleton assistance improved walking performance for older 
adults. Both objectives were simultaneously improved; self-selected walking 
speed increased by 8% (0.10 m/s; p = 0.001) and metabolic rate decreased by 19% 
(p = 0.007), resulting in a 25% decrease in energetic cost of transport 
(p = 8e-4) compared to walking with exoskeletons applying zero torque. Compared 
to younger participants in studies optimizing a single objective, our 
participants required lower exoskeleton torques, experienced smaller 
improvements in energy use, and required more time for motor adaptation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that exoskeleton assistance can improve walking 
performance for older adults and show that multiple objectives can be 
simultaneously addressed through human-in-the-loop optimization.

BACKGROUND: Rest-activity rhythms are directly related to health risks, but 
there are limited objective methods to assess them. This study aimed to 
investigate the relationship between rest-activity rhythms and cardiorespiratory 
fitness (CRF) in middle-aged workers.
METHODS: Peak oxygen uptake was measured on a treadmill to assess CRF in 254 
middle-aged workers who were divided into low, medium, and high-CRF groups based 
on tertiles. Participants were asked to wear an accelerometer (activPAL) on 
their thighs for 1 week, and the logarithmically transformed acceleration data 
were used for the analysis of a 24-hour rest-activity rhythm. Sex, age, body 
mass index, occupation, smoking status, and alcohol consumption were used as 
covariates in Model 1, with Model 2 also including walking count on 
non-workdays. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare time 
course of rest-activity rhythms changes on workdays between groups, and post-hoc 
tests were conducted using Bonferroni's correlation.
RESULTS: Higher CRF correlated with increased physical activity. In model 1, 
higher CRF showed improved interdaily stability, but the significant difference 
disappeared in model 2 after adjusting for non-workday walking counts. A 
time-course group comparison showed that the high group had significantly higher 
activity levels than those of the low group from 6:00 to 8:59 and 17:00 to 17:59 
and the medium group from 6:00 to 7:59 and 19:00 to 19:59.
CONCLUSIONS: Workers who have better rest-activity rhythms and engage in higher 
levels of physical activity on workdays tend to have higher CRF levels. Regular 
daily routines, influenced by physical activity during holidays, can positively 
impact cardiopulmonary endurance.

BACKGROUND: Persons after stroke present with an altered arm swing during 
walking. Given the known influence of the arm swing on gait, it is important to 
identify the characteristics of persons with stroke with different arm-to-leg 
coordination patterns during walking.
METHODS: Twenty-five persons after stroke walked on a self-paced treadmill at 
comfortable walking speed. The frequency of shoulder movements per stride was 
detected by Fast Fourier transform analysis on the kinematic data for hemiplegic 
shoulder movements in the sagittal plane. An independent-sample t-test or 
Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare clinical and biomechanical parameters 
between identified subgroups.
RESULTS: Two earlier described subgroups based on the number of shoulder 
flexion-extension movements during one stride could be confirmed. Participants 
in the 1:1 ratio subgroup (one arm swing during one stride, N = 15) presented 
with a less upper limb impairment and less spasticity of the elbow extensors 
(p = 0.012) than the participants in the 2:1 ratio subgroup (two arm swings 
during one stride, N = 9). Although not significant, the participants in the 1:1 
subgroup also seemed to have less spasticity of the shoulder internal rotators 
(p = 0.06) and a less walking variability based on the standard deviation of the 
step width. Further research on a greater sample should confirm these findings.
CONCLUSION: Fast Fourier transform analysis was used to identify subgroups based 
on sagittal shoulder kinematics during walking. The clinical and gait related 
differences between the identified subgroups can be taken into account in future 
research investigating post-stroke gait interventions aiming to improve the arm 
swing.

BACKGROUND: Maintaining correct posture and optimal spine function has become an 
important issue due to the increased use of computers and smartphones.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a 4-week downhill treadmill exercise 
(DTWE) program on participants with thoracic kyphosis and forward head posture 
(FHP).
METHODS: Twenty-eight male participants were randomly assigned to the DTWE (n= 
14) or standard treadmill walking exercise (STWE) (n= 14) group. They performed 
30-minute exercise three times a week for 4 weeks. The vertebral angle was 
measured using a three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis system. Surface 
electromyography (EMG) was performed to record muscle activity in the thoracic 
erector spinae (TES), sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM), and cervical erector 
spinae (CES).
RESULTS: The DTWE group showed significant increases in the craniovertebral 
angle (CVA) and TES EMG activity and significant decreases in the thoracic 
kyphosis angle and SCM and CES EMG activity compared with those shown by the 
STWE group following the intervention (p< 0.05). However, lumbar lordosis or 
pelvic tilt angles did not differ significantly between the groups after the 
intervention (p> 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: DTWE can be effective in reducing thoracic kyphosis and FHP without 
causing compensatory movements of the lumbar spine and pelvis.

Mobile brain imaging with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) can provide 
insight into the cortical processes involved in complex human walking tasks. 
While uneven terrain is common in the natural environment and poses challenges 
to human balance control, there is limited understanding of the supraspinal 
processes involved with traversing uneven terrain. The primary objective of this 
study was to quantify electrocortical activity related to parametric variations 
in terrain unevenness for neurotypical young adults. We used high-density EEG to 
measure brain activity when 32 young adults walked on a novel custom-made uneven 
terrain treadmill surface with four levels of difficulty at a walking speed 
tailored to each participant. We identified multiple brain regions associated 
with uneven terrain walking. Alpha (8 - 13 Hz) and beta (13 - 30 Hz) spectral 
power decreased in the sensorimotor and posterior parietal areas with increasing 
terrain unevenness while theta (4 - 8 Hz) power increased in the mid/posterior 
cingulate area with terrain unevenness. We also found that within stride 
spectral power fluctuations increased with terrain unevenness. Our secondary 
goal was to investigate the effect of parametric changes in walking speed (0.25 
m/s, 0.5 m/s, 0.75 m/s, 1.0 m/s) to differentiate the effects of walking speed 
from uneven terrain. Our results revealed that electrocortical activities only 
changed substantially with speed within the sensorimotor area but not in other 
brain areas. Together, these results indicate there are distinct cortical 
processes contributing to the control of walking over uneven terrain versus 
modulation of walking speed on smooth, flat terrain. Our findings increase our 
understanding of cortical involvement in an ecologically valid walking task and 
could serve as a benchmark for identifying deficits in cortical dynamics that 
occur in people with mobility deficits.

BACKGROUND: Push-off during the terminal stance phase has a major impact on 
forward progression during walking. During this phase, the ground reaction force 
is applied to a small area under the forefoot. A better understanding of how 
single forefoot areas contribute to push-off peak in healthy subjects is needed 
to develop biomimetic orthopedic devices for forefoot amputees.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the contribution of different forefoot sole areas to 
push-off peak as a function of speed and slope?
METHODS: In this analytical study, 15 healthy subjects walked on a treadmill at 
different speeds (0.8 m/s; 1.2 m/s; 1.6 m/s; max. gait speed) without 
de-/inclination and on different slopes (-10°; -5°; 0°; 5°; 10°) with normal 
walking speed. The Novel Pedar-X System was used to measure vertical sole force. 
Push-off peak of the entire sole was determined and relative contributions of 
the areas under the hallux, first ray, and toes (I-V) were calculated and 
analyzed using separate repeated-measures ANOVA (α = 0.05).
RESULTS: Push-off peak increases with faster walking speeds as well as with 10° 
inclination. Downhill walking is associated with a reduced push-off peak. The 
contribution of all forefoot areas increases with faster walking speeds and at a 
declination of -10°. Push-off contribution of the area under the hallux 
increases by about 64.6% at fast walking compared to slow walking and this 
increase is higher than that of the area under the first ray and toes 
(p < 0.05).
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate the major role of the hallux in speed 
generation and the importance of the forefoot during downhill walking. The 
results show the need for an adequate assistive device even in hallux amputation 
cases to compensate for deficits in the push-off phase.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify the contribution of the common synaptic 
drives to motor units during obstacle avoidance, using coherence analysis 
between a-pair electromyography (EMG) signals (EMG-EMG coherence).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen healthy volunteers walked on a treadmill with 
and without obstacle avoidance. During obstacle gait, subjects were instructed 
to step over an obstacle with their right leg while walking that would randomly 
and unpredictably appear. Surface EMG signals were recorded from the following 
muscles of the right leg: the proximal and distal ends of tibialis anterior (TAp 
and TAd), biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus (ST), lateral gastrocnemius (LG), 
and medial gastrocnemius (MG). Beta-band (13-30 Hz) EMG-EMG coherence was 
analysed.
RESULTS: Beta-band EMG-EMG coherence of TAp-TAd during swing phase and BF-ST 
during pre and initial swing phase when stepping over an obstacle were 
significantly higher compared to normal gait (both p < 0.05). Beta-band EMG-EMG 
coherence of TAp-TAd, BF-ST, and LG-MG during stance phase were not 
significantly different between the two gait conditions (all p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest increased common synaptic drives to 
motor units in ankle dorsiflexor and knee flexor muscles during obstacle 
avoidance. It also may reflect an increased cortical contribution to modify the 
gait patterns to avoid an obstacle.

Descending motor signals are disrupted after complete spinal cord injury (SCI) 
resulting in loss of standing and walking. We previously restored standing and 
trunk control in a person with a T3 complete SCI following implantation of 
percutaneous spinal cord epidural stimulation (SCES). We, hereby, present a 
step-by-step procedure on configuring the SCES leads to initiate rhythmic lower 
limb activation (rhythmic-SCES) resulting in independent overground stepping in 
parallel bars and using a standard walker. Initially, SCES was examined in 
supine lying at 2 Hz before initiating stepping-like activity in parallel bars 
using 20 or 30 Hz; however, single lead configuration (+2, -5) resulted in lower 
limb adduction and crossing of limbs, impairing the initiation of overground 
stepping. After 6 months, interleaving the original rhythmic-SCES with an 
additional configuration (-12, +15) on the opposite lead, resulted in a decrease 
of the extensive adduction tone and allowed the participant to initiate 
overground stepping up to 16 consecutive steps. The current paradigm suggests 
that interleaving two rhythmic-SCES configurations may improve the excitability 
of the spinal circuitry to better interpret the residual descending supraspinal 
signals with the ascending proprioceptive inputs, resulting in a stepping-like 
motor behavior after complete SCI.

Leg length discrepancy (LLD) is a common postural deviation of musculoskeletal 
origin, which causes compensatory reactions and often leads to injury. The aim 
of the study was to investigate the effect of artificially induced LLD on gait 
symmetry by means of the spatiotemporal gait parameters and ground reaction 
forces (GRFs) using a treadmill equipped with capacitive sensors (instrumented) 
as well as the EMG activity of trunk and hip muscles during walking and running. 
Twenty-six healthy male and female college students were required to perform two 
sets of four 2.5-min walking and running trials on an instrumented treadmill at 
5.6 and 8.1 km·h-1, respectively, without (0) and with 1, 2, and 3 cm LLD 
implemented by wearing a special rubber shoe. Statistical analysis was performed 
using one-way repeated measures or a mixed-design ANOVA. Most spatiotemporal 
gait parameters and GRFs demonstrated an increase or decrease as LLD increased 
either on the short-limb or the long-limb side, with changes becoming more 
apparent at ≥1 cm LLD during walking and ≥2 cm LLD during running. The EMG 
activity of trunk and hip muscles was not affected by LLD. Our findings showed 
that gait symmetry in terms of treadmill-based spatiotemporal parameters of gait 
and GRFs is affected by LLD, the magnitude of which depends on the speed of 
locomotion.

BACKGROUND: Low-Dye tape (LDT) is a short-term treatment for plantar fasciitis, 
where external stabilization by means of the tape improves kinetics, kinematics, 
pain level, and electromyography (EMG).
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the EMG of the medial 
gastrocnemius (MG) and changes in arch height (AH) based on the type of foot.
METHODS: A total of 30 subjects participated in this study; they walked on a 
treadmill barefoot and when taped, where the average activity and changes in AH 
were measured over a 30 s period. The statistical intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC) to test for reliability was calculated, and the Wilcoxon test 
was determined for measures of EMG and AH.
RESULTS: The reliability of the values of EMG was almost perfect. The data show 
that there was an increase in height in the comparison of the moment 
pre-baseline walking and post-taped walking on neutral feet (5.61 ± 0.46 vs. 
5.77 ± 0.39 cm, p < 0.05), on pronated feet (5.67 ± 0.57 vs. 6.01 ± 0.53 cm, p < 
0.001) and on supinated feet (5.97 ± 0.36 vs. 6.28 ± 0.27 cm, p < 0.05). In the 
MG, EMG activity decreased significantly in the taped condition compared to the 
baseline condition in neutral subjects (0.0081 ± 0.016 vs. 0.076 ± 0.016 mV, p < 
0.05) and in pronated subjects (0.081 ± 0.022 vs. 0.068 ± 0.025 mV, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that with the use of LDT, there was an 
improvement in the average activity in the MG in pronated and neutral feet. All 
foot types improved in arch height with the use of tape.

Intervention parameters such as the challenge, amount, and dosage (challenge × 
amount) have the potential to alter the efficacy of rehabilitation interventions 
after stroke. This systematic review investigated the effect of intervention 
parameters of challenge, amount, and dosage on improvements in walking outcomes 
following treadmill training (TT) and comparison interventions in people with 
stroke. Randomized controlled trials were included if they: (i) investigated 
interventions of TT or bodyweight-supported TT (BWSTT); (ii) made comparisons 
with other physiotherapy interventions, other types of TT, or no intervention; 
(iii) studied people with stroke; (iv) reported sufficient data on challenge and 
amount parameters; and (v) measured walking speed or endurance. Completeness of 
reporting was evaluated using the TIDieR-Rehab checklist and risk of bias was 
assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The review included 26 
studies; 15 studies compared TT or BWSTT with other physiotherapy interventions 
and 11 studies compared different types of TT. Meta-analyses provided evidence 
with low to moderate certainty that greater differences in challenge and dosage 
between treadmill and comparison physiotherapy interventions produced greater 
effects on walking endurance (p < 0.01). However, challenge and dosage did not 
influence walking speed outcomes. The analysis of intervention amount was 
limited by the lack of studies that manipulated the amount of intervention. 
Overall, the findings indicate that, after stroke, some of the efficacy of TT on 
walking endurance can be explained by the challenge level during training. This 
supports the implementation of TT at higher challenge levels in stroke 
rehabilitation practice.

Spatiotemporal gait parameters such as step time and walking speed can be used 
to quantify gait performance and determine physical function. Inertial 
measurement units (IMUs) allow for the measurement of spatiotemporal gait 
parameters in unconstrained environments but must be validated against a gold 
standard. While many IMU systems and algorithms have been validated during 
treadmill walking and overground walking in a straight line, fewer studies have 
validated algorithms during more complex walking conditions such as continuous 
turning in different directions. This study explored the concurrent validity in 
a population of healthy adults (range 26-52 years) of three different algorithms 
using lumbar and foot mounted IMUs to calculate spatiotemporal gait parameters: 
two methods utilizing an inverted pendulum model, and one method based on 
strapdown integration. IMU data was compared to a Vicon twelve-camera 
optoelectronic system, using data collected from 9 participants performing 
straight walking and continuous walking trials at different speeds, resulting in 
162 walking trials in total. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCA,1) for 
absolute agreement were calculated between the algorithm outputs and Vicon 
output. Temporal parameters were comparable in all methods and ranged from 
moderate to excellent, except double support time which was poor. Strapdown 
integration performed better for estimating spatial parameters than pendulum 
models during straight walking, but worse during turning. Selecting the most 
appropriate model should take into consideration both speed and walking 
condition.

With global warming, workers are increasingly exposed to strenuous occupations 
in hot environments. Given age- and disease-associated declines in 
thermoregulatory function, older workers are at an elevated risk of developing 
heat-related injuries. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is thought to 
confer neuroprotection during acute exercise, however, the influence of 
environmental heat on BDNF responses during prolonged work remains unclear. 
Therefore, we evaluated serum BDNF concentrations before and after 180 min of 
moderate-intensity treadmill walking (200 W/m2) and after 60 min of 
post-exercise recovery in temperate (wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) 16°C) and 
hot (WBGT 32°C) environments in 13 healthy young men (mean [SD; 22 [3] years), 
12 healthy older men (59 [4] years), 10 men with hypertension (HTN) (60 [4] 
years), and 9 men with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (60 [5] years). In the temperate 
condition, all but one participant (1 HTN) completed the 180 min of exercise. 
While exercise tolerance in the heat was lower in older men with HTN (117 min 
[45]) and T2D (123 min [42]) compared to healthy older men (159 min [31]) (both 
p ≤ 0.049), similar end-exercise rectal temperatures (38.9°C [0.4]) were 
observed across groups, paralleled by similar elevations in serum BDNF across 
groups at end-exercise (+1106 pg/mL [203]) and end-recovery (+938 pg/mL [146]; 
all p ≤ 0.01) in the heat. No changes in serum BDNF were observed in the 
temperate condition. Our findings indicate similar BDNF responses in individuals 
with HTN or T2D compared to their healthy counterparts, despite exhibiting 
reduced tolerance to heat.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a 24-week, center-based, aerobic 
exercise program plus duloxetine to treat symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) 
and major depression.
DESIGN: Patients with symptomatic knee OA and major depression were recruited 
between August 2021 and November 2022 from the University of Maryland and VA 
Maryland Health Care Systems and Baltimore metropolitan area using medical 
records and advertisements. The intervention included 1) supervised treadmill 
walking 3 times weekly and 2) duloxetine starting at 30 ​mg each day and 
titrating up to the optimal dosage of 60 ​mg daily. Data collection occurred at 
baseline and 12- and 24-weeks follow-up. Feasibility was evaluated from 
recruitment rates, reasons for drop out, and treatment adherence. Clinical 
measures included the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and 
the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D).
RESULTS: Among 377 interested participants, 9 patients were enrolled, and 1 
completed treatment. The most common reason reported for not prescreening was 
time commitment (n ​= ​39), many patients did not satisfy depression screening 
criteria (n ​= ​45), and most enrolled participants were not experiencing a 
major depressive episode (n ​= ​6). The single treated participant was 100 ​% 
adherent to duloxetine and depression severity decreased (HAM-D ​= ​25 to 1), 
but compliance to supervised exercise was only 26 ​%, and knee pain severity 
changed little (KOOS ​= ​41.7 to 44.4).
CONCLUSIONS: This intervention had low feasibility. Time commitment to 
supervised exercise sessions reduced accessibility, and depression defined by 
diagnostic criteria precluded knee OA patients with depressive symptoms not a 
meeting case-level diagnosis from receiving treatment.

Robotic ankle exoskeletons have been shown to reduce human effort during 
walking. However, existing ankle exoskeleton control approaches are limited in 
their ability to apply biomimetic torque across diverse tasks outside of the 
controlled lab environment. Energy shaping control can provide task-invariant 
assistance without estimating the user's state, classifying task, or reproducing 
pre-defined torque trajectories. In previous work, we showed that an optimally 
task-invariant energy shaping controller implemented on a knee-ankle exoskeleton 
reduced the effort of certain muscles for a range of tasks. In this paper, we 
extend this approach to the sensor suite available at the ankle and present its 
implementation on a commercially-available, bilateral ankle exoskeleton. An 
experiment with three healthy subjects walking on a circuit and on a treadmill 
showed that the controller can approximate biomimetic profiles for varying 
terrains and task transitions without classifying tasks or switching control 
modes.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of virtual reality-based 
treadmill training on gait performance and tolerance in the elderly.
DESIGN: Two-armed randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: The Medical Rehabilitation Sciences Department, Umm Al Qura University, 
Saudi Arabia.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty Saudi elderly of both sexes, aged 65-75 years, were 
included.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were divided into two groups. The control group 
received treadmill training without virtual reality, alongside a conventional 
exercise program. The experimental group received a training program that was 
similar to the control group's exercises but with C-Mill virtual reality 
treadmill training. The program lasted one hour, three times per week, over four 
consecutive weeks.
MAIN MEASURES: The study assessed changes in outcome measures at baseline, 
Post-1 (after four weeks of training), and Post-2 (four weeks post-training). 
These measures encompassed the primary outcome, the 6-minute walk test (meter), 
as well as secondary outcomes such as stride length (meter), stride time 
(second), cadence (steps/minute), and velocity (meter/second). These parameters 
were evaluated using the GaitRite electronic gait analysis walkway.
RESULTS: The experimental group showed better improvement in the mean values of 
the 6-minute walk test, stride length, stride time, cadence, and velocity 
compared to the control group at post-1 and post-2. The P-values were 
respectively at post-1 (0.019, 0.015, 0.041, 0.013, and 0.021) and (0.011, 
0.025, 0.073, 0.061, and 0.017) at post-2 (all, P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: C-Mill virtual reality treadmill training shows potential in 
improving gait parameters and walking tolerance in the elderly in Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND: Miyasato et al. show that peak oxygen consumption, walking economy, 
anaerobic threshold, and cardiovascular responses (heart rate, blood pressure, 
and rate pressure product) during walking were similar between men and women 
with peripheral artery disease and intermittent claudication. There were no 
differences in the physiological responses to walking between men and women with 
intermittent claudication. Sex per se is not a factor that demands changes in 
walking prescription for patients with intermittent claudication.
OBJECTIVE: Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), anaerobic threshold, walking 
economy, and cardiovascular responses during walking are used to guide and 
monitor walking training in patients with peripheral artery disease and 
intermittent claudication. Women with peripheral artery disease and intermittent 
claudication present greater impairments than men, and evaluating training 
markers according to sex for decisions regarding walking prescription in this 
population is important. This study aimed to compare VO2peak, walking economy, 
anaerobic threshold, and cardiovascular responses during walking in men and 
women with peripheral artery disease and intermittent claudication.
METHODS: Forty patients (20 men and 20 women with similar baseline 
characteristics) underwent a cardiopulmonary treadmill test (3.2km/h and 2% 
increase in slope every 2 minutes until maximal leg pain). The VO2 and 
rate-pressure product were assessed. Data from men and women were compared using 
t-tests.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between men and women (VO2peak: 
15.0±4.8 versus 13.9±2.9mL∙kg-1∙min-1, p=0.38; walking economy: 9.6±2.7 versus 
8.4±1.6mL∙kg-1∙min-1, p=0.09; anaerobic threshold: 10.5±3.2 versus 
10.5±2.2mL∙kg-1∙min-1, p=0.98; rate pressure product at 1st stage: 13,465± 2,910 
versus 14,445±4,379bpm∙mmHg, p=0.41; and rate pressure product at anaerobic 
threshold:13,673±3,100 versus 16,390±5,870bpm∙mmHg, p=0.08 and rate pressure 
product at peak exercise: 21,253±6,141 versus 21,923±7,414bpm∙mmHg, p=0.76, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Men and women with peripheral artery disease and similar baseline 
characteristics presented similar responses to walking, suggesting that 
decisions regarding walking prescription and monitoring can be made regardless 
of sex in this specific population.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is increasingly being used for 
Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the evaluation of its clinical impact remains 
complex owing to the heterogeneity of patients and treatments. Therefore, we 
used a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced PD rat model to investigate whether 
anodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex (M1) alleviates PD motor deficits. 
Before tDCS treatment, unilateral PD rats preferentially used the forelimb 
ipsilateral to the lesion in the exploratory cylinder test and showed reduced 
locomotor activity in the open field test. In addition, PD-related clumsy 
forelimb movements during treadmill walking were detected using deep 
learning-based video analysis (DeepLabCut). When the 5-day tDCS treatment began, 
the forelimb-use asymmetry was ameliorated gradually, and locomotor activity 
increased to pre-lesion levels. tDCS treatment also normalized unnatural 
forelimb movement during walking and restored a balanced gait. However, these 
therapeutic effects were rapidly lost or gradually disappeared when the tDCS 
treatment was terminated. Histological analysis at the end of the experiment 
revealed that the animals had moderately advanced PD, with 40-50% of dopamine 
neurons and fibers preserved on the injured side compared with those on the 
intact side. Although it remains a challenge to elucidate the neural mechanisms 
of the transient improvement in motor function induced by tDCS, the results of 
this study provide evidence that tDCS of the M1 produces positive behavioral 
outcomes in PD animals and provides the basis for further clinical research 
examining the application of tDCS in patients with PD.

BACKGROUND: A lack of data exist about the effectiveness of active treatments 
for persistent plantar heel pain (PPHP).
OBJECTIVES: To compare short-term functional and clinical effects of a 4-week 
barefoot or shod treadmill walking program for people with PPHP.
METHODS: A single-blinded clinical trial randomized 52 participants with PPHP 
into either a barefoot walking group (BWG), or a shod walking group (SWG). All 
participants received therapeutic ultrasound. Outcomes were measured at baseline 
(t0), following 4 weeks of treatment (t1), and at 1-month follow-up (t2). The 
SF-36 functional questionnaire score was the main outcome. Secondary outcomes 
were self-reported and clinically-assessed pain provocation levels, pressure 
pain thresholds and pain tolerance. Treadmill walking time and speed were 
measured at t0 and t1; people also recorded the time spent walking each day in a 
diary.
RESULTS: The BWG exhibited significant improvements in all SF-36 items (except 
""emotional well-being"") (P < 0.05), whereas the SWG exhibited improvements only 
in ""pain"" and ""health change"" items (P = 0.0001; effect size 0.13-0.94). Greater 
improvements were observed in the BWG than the SWG for ""physical function"" (P = 
0.019) and ""role limitations due to physical health"" items (P = 0.035). Both 
groups demonstrated significant improvements in pain, with greater improvements 
in the BWG (P = 0.0001; effect size 0.89). Only the BWG showed significant 
improvements in pain pressure thresholds (P < 0.05; effect size 0.70) and pain 
tolerance (P < 0.001; effect size 0.67). Both groups significantly increased 
their speed and time spent walking on the treadmill (BWG Δ=19.7 min and Δ=1.7 
km/h; SWG Δ=16.7 min and Δ=1.1 km/h) and time outdoors (SWG ∆=38.2 min/week; BWG 
mean ∆=48.5 min/week) (P < 0.001). All clinical tests of pain were significantly 
less positive in the BWG at all time points (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Both walking programs benefited people with PPHP by alleviating 
pain and improving function and quality of life. Greater improvements were 
observed in the BWG than the SWG overall.

BACKGROUND: The most common symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD) is 
intermittent claudication that involves the calf, thigh, and/or buttock muscles. 
How the specific location of this leg pain is related to altered gait, however, 
is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that because the location of claudication symptoms 
uniquely affects different leg muscle groups in people with PAD, this would 
produce distinctive walking patterns.
METHODS: A total of 105 participants with PAD and 35 age-matched older 
volunteers without PAD (CTRL) were recruited. Participants completed walking 
impairment questionnaires (WIQ), Gardner-Skinner progressive treadmill tests, 
the six-minute walk test, and we performed an advanced evaluation of the 
biomechanics of their overground walking. Participants with PAD were categorized 
into 4 groups according to their stated pain location(s): calf only (C, n = 43); 
thigh and calf (TC, n = 18); buttock and calf (BC, n = 15); or buttock, thigh, 
and calf (BTC, n = 29). Outcomes were compared between CTRL, C, TC, BC and BTC 
groups using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc comparisons to identify and assess 
statistically significant differences.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between CTRL, C, TC, BC and BTC 
groups in distances walked or walking speed when either pain-free or 
experiencing claudication pain. Each participant with PAD had significantly 
dysfunctional biomechanical gait parameters, even when pain-free, when compared 
to CTRL (pain-free) walking data. During pain-free walking, out of the 18 gait 
parameters evaluated, we only identified significant differences in hip power 
generation during push-off (in C and TC groups) and in knee power absorption 
during weight acceptance (in TC and BC groups). There were no between-group 
differences in gait parameters while people with PAD were walking with 
claudication pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that PAD affects the ischemic lower 
extremities in a diffuse manner irrespective of the location of claudication 
symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Controlled ankle motion (CAM) boots are often prescribed during the 
rehabilitation of lower limb injuries and pathologies to reduce foot and ankle 
movement and loading whilst allowing the patient to maintain normal daily 
function.
RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this study was to quantify the compensatory 
biomechanical mechanisms undergone by the ipsilateral hip and knee joints during 
walking. In addition, the compensatory mechanisms displayed by the contralateral 
limb were also considered.
METHODS: Twelve healthy participants walked on an instrumented treadmill at 
their preferred walking speed. They underwent kinematic and kinetic analysis 
during four footwear conditions: normal shoes (NORM), a Malleo Immobil Air 
Walker on the right leg (OTTO), a Rebound® Air Walker on the right leg with 
(EVEN) and without (OSS) an Evenup Shoelift™ on the contralateral leg.
RESULTS: CAM boot wear increased the relative joint contribution to total 
mechanical work from the ipsilateral hip and knee joints (p < 0.05), which was 
characterised by increased hip and knee abduction during the swing phase of the 
gait cycle. EVEN increased the absolute work done and relative contribution of 
the contralateral limb. CAM boot wear reduced walking speed (p < 0.05), which 
was partially compensated for during EVEN.
SIGNIFICANCE: The increased hip abduction in the ipsilateral leg was likely 
caused by the increase in effective leg length and limb mass, which could lead 
to secondary site complications following prolonged CAM boot wear. Although 
prescribing an even-up walker partially mitigates these compensatory mechanisms, 
adverse effects to contralateral limb kinematics and kinetics (e.g., elevated 
knee joint work) should be considered.

BACKGROUND: Gait retraining is a common therapeutic intervention that can alter 
gait characteristics to reduce knee loading in knee osteoarthritis populations. 
It can be enhanced when combined with biofeedback that provides real-time 
information about the users' gait, either directly (i.e. knee moment feedback) 
or indirectly (i.e. gait pattern feedback). However, it is unknown which types 
of biofeedback are more effective at reducing knee loading, and also how the 
changes in gait affect pain during different activities of daily living. 
Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the acute (6 weeks of training) and 
chronic (1 month post training) effects of biofeedback based on personalised 
gait patterns to reduce knee loading and pain in people with knee 
osteoarthritis, as well as examine if more than one session of knee moment 
feedback is needed to optimise the gait patterns.
METHODS: This is a parallel group, randomised controlled trial in a symptomatic 
knee osteoarthritis population in which participants will be randomised into 
either a knee moment biofeedback group (n = 20), a gait pattern biofeedback 
group (n = 20) or a control group (n = 10). Supervised training sessions will be 
carried out weekly for six continuous weeks, with real-time biofeedback provided 
using marker-based motion capture and an instrumented treadmill. Baseline, 
post-intervention and 1-month follow-up assessments will be performed to measure 
knee loading parameters, gait pattern parameters, muscle activation, knee pain 
and functional ability.
DISCUSSION: This study will identify the optimal gait patterns for participants' 
gait retraining and compare the effectiveness of gait pattern biofeedback to a 
control group in reducing knee loading and index knee pain. Additionally, this 
study will explore how many sessions are needed to identify the optimal gait 
pattern with knee moment feedback. Results will be disseminated in future 
peer-reviewed journal articles, conference presentations and internet media to a 
wide audience of clinicians, physiotherapists, researchers and individuals with 
knee osteoarthritis.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was retrospectively registered under the 
International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry on 7th March 
2023 (ISRCTN28045513).

INTRODUCTION: Backward-directed resistance is the resistance applied in the 
opposite direction of the individual's walking motion. Progressive application 
of backward-directed resistance during walking at a target speed engages 
adaptive motor control to maintain that speed. During split-belt walking, a 
motor control strategy must be applied that allows the person to keep up with 
the two belts to maintain their position on the treadmill. This situation 
becomes more challenging when progressive resistance is applied since each limb 
needs to adapt to the greater resistance to maintain the position. We propose 
that strategies aimed at changing relative propulsion forces with each limb may 
explain the motor control strategy used. This study aimed to identify the 
changes in propulsive force dynamics that allow individuals to maintain their 
position while walking on an instrumented split-belt treadmill with 
progressively increasing backward-directed resistance.
METHODS: We utilized an instrumented split-belt treadmill while users had to 
overcome a set of increasing backward-directed resistance through the center of 
mass. Eighteen non-impaired participants (mean age = 25.2 ± 2.51) walked against 
five levels of backward resistance (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20% of participant's body 
weight) in two different modalities: single-belt vs. split-belt treadmill. On 
the single-belt mode, the treadmill's pace was the participant's comfortable 
walking speed (CWS). In split-belt mode, the dominant limb's belt pace was half 
of the CWS, and the non-dominant limb's belt speed was at the CWS.
RESULTS: We assessed differences between single-belt vs. split-belt conditions 
in the slope of the linear relationship between change in propulsive impulse 
relative to change of backward resistance amount. In split-belt conditions, the 
slower limb showed a significantly steeper increase in propulsion generation 
compared to the fast limb across resistance levels.
DISCUSSION: As a possible explanation, the slow limb also exhibited a 
significantly increased slope of the change in trailing limb angle (TLA), which 
was strongly correlated to the propulsive impulse slope values. We conclude that 
the motor control strategy used to maintain position on a split-belt treadmill 
when challenged with backward-directed resistance is to increase the propulsive 
forces of the slow limb relative to the fast limb by progressively increasing 
the TLA.

BACKGROUND: Studies using inertial measurement units (IMUs) for gait assessment 
have shown promising results regarding accuracy of gait event detection and 
spatiotemporal parameters. However, performance of such algorithms is challenged 
in irregular walking patterns, such as in individuals with gait deficits. Based 
on the literature, we developed an algorithm to detect initial contact (IC) and 
terminal contact (TC) and calculate spatiotemporal gait parameters. We evaluated 
the validity of this algorithm for regular and irregular gait patterns against a 
3D optical motion capture system (OMCS).
METHODS: Twenty healthy participants (aged 59 ± 12 years) and 10 people in the 
chronic phase after stroke (aged 61 ± 11 years) were equipped with 4 IMUs: on 
both feet, sternum and lower back (MTw Awinda, Xsens) and 26 reflective makers. 
Participants walked on an instrumented treadmill for 2 minutes (i) with their 
preferred stride lengths and (ii) once with irregular stride lengths (±20% 
deviation) induced by light projected stepping stones. Accuracy of the algorithm 
was evaluated on stride-by-stride agreement of IC, TC, stride time, length and 
velocity with OMCS. Bland-Altman-like plots were made for the spatiotemporal 
parameters, while differences in detection of IC and TC time instances were 
shown in histogram plots. Performance of the algorithm was compared between 
regular and irregular gait with a linear mixed model. This was done by comparing 
the performance in healthy participants in the regular vs irregular walking 
condition, and by comparing the agreement in healthy participants with stroke 
participants in the regular walking condition.
RESULTS: For each condition at least 1,500 strides were included for analysis. 
Compared to OMCS, IMU-based IC detection in both groups and condition was on 
average 9-17 (SD ranging from 7 to 35) ms, while IMU-based TC was on average 
15-24 (SD ranging from 12 to 35) ms earlier. When comparing regular and 
irregular gait in healthy participants, the difference between methods was 2.5 
ms higher for IC, 3.4 ms lower for TC, 0.3 cm lower for stride length, and 0.4 
cm/s higher for stride velocity in the irregular walking condition. No 
difference was found on stride time. When comparing the differences between 
methods between healthy and stroke participants, the difference between methods 
was 7.6 ms lower for IC, 3.8 cm lower for stride length, and 3.4 cm/s lower for 
stride velocity in stroke participants. No differences were found on differences 
between methods on TC detection and stride time between stroke and healthy 
participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Small irrelevant differences were found on gait event detection and 
spatiotemporal parameters due to irregular walking by imposing irregular stride 
lengths or pathological (stroke) gait. Furthermore, IMUs seem equally good 
compared to OMCS to assess gait variability based on stride time, but less 
accurate based on stride length.

Lower-limb joint quasi-stiffness in the frontal and sagittal planes during 
walking at different step widths.

Quasi-stiffness describes the intersegmental joint moment-angle relationship 
throughout the progression of a task. Previous work has explored sagittal-plane 
ankle quasi-stiffness and its application for the development of powered 
lower-limb assistive devices. However, frontal-plane quasi-stiffness remains 
largely unexplored but has important implications for the development of 
exoskeletons since clinical populations often walk with wider steps and rely on 
frontal-plane balance recovery strategies at the hip and ankle. This study aimed 
to characterize frontal-plane hip and ankle quasi-stiffness during walking and 
determine how step width affects quasi-stiffness in both the frontal and 
sagittal planes. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected and quasi-stiffness 
values computed for healthy young adults (n = 15) during treadmill walking 
across a range of step widths. We identified specific subphases of the gait 
cycle that exhibit linear and quadratic frontal-plane quasi-stiffness 
approximations for the hip and ankle, respectively. In addition, we found that 
at wider step widths, sagittal-plane ankle quasi-stiffness increased during 
early stance (∼12-35% gait cycle), sagittal-plane hip quasi-stiffness decreased 
in late stance (∼40-55% gait cycle) and frontal-plane hip quasi-stiffness 
decreased during terminal stance (∼48-65% gait cycle). These results provide a 
framework for further exploration of frontal-plane quasi-stiffness, lend insight 
into how quasi-stiffness may relate to balance control at various step widths, 
and motivate the development of stiffness-modulating assistive devices to 
improve balance related outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Repetitive impacts during running are associated with some running 
injuries. Tibial acceleration is a proxy for tibial loading, and interventions 
that can decrease it are likely to be of interest to the running community.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What effect do running gait cues have on peak vertical tibial 
acceleration at a comfortable and moderate running pace, and how will these cues 
be executed?
METHODS: Twenty-seven participants ran on a treadmill according to the following 
cues in random order: run softly and lightly, run with shorter steps, and 
increase preferred step rate by 7.5 %. Participants maintained each condition 
for one minute before returning to their 'preferred' running pattern for two 
minutes. Two tibia-mounted inertial measurement unit sensors were used to 
collect tibial acceleration data at a 'comfortable' and 'moderate' run pace. A 
repeated measures analysis of variance test was used to compare the means 
between running conditions.
RESULTS: Compared to preferred running, the decrease step length (-8 %, 
p = 0.002, Cohen's d=0.33) and run softly and lightly (-9 %, p = 0.040, Cohen's 
d=0.38) cues provided a significant reduction in peak vertical tibial 
acceleration during a comfortable run pace. No significant difference was 
observed with an increase in step rate. Compared to preferred running, there was 
no significant difference in peak vertical tibial acceleration with any of the 
running gait cues during a moderate run pace.
SIGNIFICANCE: Instructing runners to decrease step length or run softly and 
lightly can result in small reductions in peak vertical tibial acceleration 
during a comfortable run pace, but running gait cues during a moderate run pace 
provide no effects. Differences in the execution of each cue are likely to 
influence overall tibial loading throughout the stride cycle. These findings 
provide novel biomechanical evidence for the potential effects of running 
retraining strategies for reducing tibial accelerations at different running 
paces.

Computer-controlled treadmills are common in many gait labs and offer great 
potential for conducting perturbation-based postural studies. However, the 
time-course of these disturbances can be too brief to be controlled manually 
through product software. Here we present a system that combines a Bertec® 
split-belt treadmill with custom hardware and software to deliver postural 
disturbances during standing and record data from multiple sources 
simultaneously. We used this system to administer to 15 healthy participants an 
8-session perturbation-based training protocol in which they learned to respond 
without stepping to progressively larger perturbations. Kinematic, 
electromyographic, and force data were collected throughout. Motion capture was 
used to characterize the accuracy and repeatability of the treadmill-delivered 
perturbations with respect to duration, displacement, and peak velocity. These 
(observed) data were compared to that expected based on software commands and 
the known constraints of the treadmill (i.e., 10 Hz operating speed). We found 
perturbation durations to be as expected. Peak velocities and displacements were 
slightly higher than expected (average increases were 0.59 cm/s and 1.76 cm, 
respectively). Because this increase in magnitude was consistent, it did not 
impede training or affect data analysis. Treadmill behavior was repeatable 
across 95 % of trials.

OBJECTIVES: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising 
non-invasive brain stimulation technique for treating chronic pain, yet its 
effectiveness in chronic lower extremity pain due to lumbar spinal stenosis 
(LSS) has not been studied. This research aimed to investigate the impact of 
tDCS on pain, walking capacity, functional status, and quality of life in LSS 
patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, 
sham-controlled study, 32 LSS patients received either real or sham tDCS over 
the motor cortex contralateral to the patient's painful lower extremity for 10 
consecutive weekdays (10 sessions). Evaluations were conducted at baseline, 
post-session, and 1-3 months later. The pain was evaluated by Visual Analog 
Scale (VAS), walking duration and distance by Treadmill Walking Test, functional 
status by Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (MODQ) and quality of life 
by Short Form-36 (SF-36).
RESULTS: In-group comparisons, active tDCS showed sustained analgesic effects 
for 3-month post-treatment, distinct from sham. After the final session, active 
group exhibited significantly better asymptomatic walking distance and duration. 
Active stimulation led to notably lower MOLBDQ scores after 1 month. Significant 
improvements in SF-36 subscales were seen after 3 months, especially in pain, 
physical functioning, and general health. Positive tDCS effects on pain, 
claudication, and some quality of life aspects were evident at 3 months, while 
functional status improvements were mainly limited to 1 month.
CONCLUSION: tDCS shows potential as a safe, non-invasive technique for 
alleviating chronic LSS-related pain, enhancing mobility, functionality, and 
quality of life.

Lower-limb gait training (GT) exoskeletons have been successfully used in 
rehabilitation programs to overcome the burden of locomotor impairment. However, 
providing suitable net interaction torques to assist patient movements is still 
a challenge. Previous transparent operation approaches have been tested in 
treadmill-based GT exoskeletons to improve user-robot interaction. However, it 
is not yet clear how a transparent lower-limb GT system affects user's gait 
kinematics during overground walking, which unlike treadmill-based systems, 
requires active participation of the subjects to maintain stability. In this 
study, we implemented a transparent operation strategy on the ExoRoboWalker, an 
overground GT exoskeleton, to investigate its effect on the user's gait. The 
approach employs a feedback zero-torque controller with feedforward compensation 
for the exoskeleton's dynamics and actuators' impedance. We analyzed the data of 
five healthy subjects walking overground with the exoskeleton in transparent 
mode (ExoTransp) and non-transparent mode (ExoOff) and walking without 
exoskeleton (NoExo). The transparent controller reduced the user-robot 
interaction torque and improved the user's gait kinematics relative to ExoOff. 
No significant difference in stride length is observed between ExoTransp and 
NoExo (p = 0.129). However, the subjects showed a significant difference in 
cadence between ExoTransp (50.9± 1.1 steps/min) and NoExo (93.7 ± 8.7 steps/min) 
(p = 0.015), but not between ExoTransp and ExoOff (p = 0.644). Results suggest 
that subjects wearing the exoskeleton adjust their gait as in an 
attention-demanding task changing the spatiotemporal gait characteristics likely 
to improve gait balance.

In everyday life during terrestrial locomotion our body interacts with two media 
opposing the forward movement of the body: the ground and the air. Whereas the 
work done to overcome the ground reaction force has been extensively studied, 
the work done to overcome still air resistance has been only indirectly 
estimated by means of theoretical studies and by measurements of the force 
exerted on puppets simulating the geometry of the human body. In this study, we 
directly measured the force exerted by still air resistance on eight male 
subjects during walking and running on an instrumented treadmill with a belt 
moving at the same speed of a flow of laminar air facing the subject. Overall, 
the coefficient of proportionality between drag and velocity squared (Aeff) was 
smaller during running than walking. During running Aeff decreased progressively 
with increasing average velocity up to an apparently constant, velocity 
independent value, similar to that predicted in the literature using indirect 
methods. A predictive equation to estimate drag as a function of the speed and 
the height of the running subject is provided.

Uptake and outcomes of supervised exercise therapy for peripheral artery 
disease: The importance of vascular medicine specialists at a large midwestern 
health care system during the first 5 years of CMS reimbursement.

BACKGROUND: Supervised exercise therapy (SET) is the cornerstone of medical 
therapy for symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD). Despite the efficacy of 
SET, initial reports following the 2017 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) reimbursement decision indicate low SET uptake, referral, and 
completion. Vascular medicine specialists are key to the success of such 
programs. We examined rates of SET referral, completion, and outcomes in a 
health system with a robust SET program during the first 5 years of CMS 
reimbursement.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with PAD referred to SET 
between October 1, 2017 and December 31, 2022 was conducted. Patient demographic 
and medical characteristics, SET indication, referring provider specialty, SET 
participation (e.g., exercise modality, number of sessions, treadmill 
prescription), and outcomes were abstracted. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, 
and multiple linear regression were used to examine the sample, evaluate 
outcomes, and explore outcomes by relevant covariates (i.e., age, sex, referring 
provider specialty).
RESULTS: Of 5320 patients with PAD, N = 773 were referred to SET; N = 415 
enrolled and were included in the present study. Vascular medicine and vascular 
surgery specialists were the two primary sources of referrals (30.6% and 51.6%, 
respectively). A total of 207 patients (49.9%) completed SET. Statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful improvements were observed in all 
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: SET referral and completion rates are low in the 5 years following 
CMS reimbursement, despite the advocacy of vascular medicine specialists. SET is 
effective in improving patient functional capacity and quality of life. 
Additional efforts are needed to increase both SET availability and referrals as 
part of comprehensive treatment of PAD.

Age-related adaptation of the body's kinematic responses to unpredictable trip 
perturbations induced by a split-belt treadmill().

Yoo D, Lee C, Ahn J, Lee BC.

This study quantitatively investigated motor adaptations to unpredictable trip 
perturbations repeatedly induced by a commercially available split-belt 
treadmill. Using a motion capture system, three outcome measures (i.e., maximum 
trunk flexion angle, maximum right hip flexion angle, and minimum whole-body 
center of mass (COM) position) quantified the kinematics of 10 healthy young 
(YG) and 10 healthy older adult (OG) groups. In each of the five trials, random 
trip perturbations were induced between the 31st and 40th steps. The three 
outcome measures were computed for the pre-trip period (from the baseline gait 
to the five steps before the trip perturbation) and the recovery period (after 
the trip perturbation to the baseline gait). The results showed that both groups 
progressively adapted the body's kinematic responses to the repetitive trip 
perturbations. The findings suggest that our trip-inducing technology may train 
young and older adults to improve the body's kinematic responses and reduce the 
risk of falling.

A Real-Time Gait Phase Detection Method Based on BiLSTM-Attention Model.

Xu S, Dong H, Xu R, Meng L, Ming D.

Real-time gait phase detection is essential to achieve accurate and stable 
walking assistance in intelligent rehabilitation training for patients with 
motor disorders. This study proposed an efficient real-time detection method to 
detect three gait phases (loading response, stance, and swing) based on a 
bidirectional long short-term memory network with an attention layer 
(BiLSTM-Attention). We validated our method on a public dataset where eight 
healthy subjects' data during treadmill walking were employed. A single inertial 
measurement unit (IMU) was attached to the shank to measure the sagittal plane 
acceleration of the lower leg and the angular velocity around the central 
lateral axis. These data were transposed and segmented into data sequences based 
on labels using a sliding window method. The data from 8 participants were 
divided into the training, validation, and test sets (5:1:2). Results showed the 
average recognition accuracy of the proposed model on new subjects was 97.40% 
with an average time delay of 15.7±10.1ms, showing the method's potential to be 
applied for practice use.

Classification of fall risk across the lifespan using gait derived features from 
a wearable device.

Sasso G, Mou L, Hernandez ME.

Falls are one of the leading factors of injury and fatality in older adults. 
Given the importance of early detection of adults at higher risk of falls, we 
evaluated the ability of machine learning to classify fall risk in adults across 
the lifespan using wearable sensors embedded in a smartshirt. We evaluated the 
classification performance of binary and multiclass fall risk classifier models 
using SciKit Digital Health in adults across the lifespan. Using a k-fold and 
group k-fold cross-validation strategy, we demonstrate the feasibility of fall 
risk classification using accelerometer data from 10 second epochs of treadmill 
walking data from adults across the lifespan. We achieved an 88% accuracy in a 
binary clasifier of fallers vs. non-fallers, and an 86% accuracy in a multiclass 
classifier comparing non-fallers, fallers, and recurrent fallers using 
retrospective fall histories. Comparing group k-fold vs. k-fold cross-validation 
strategies, we find a 22-27% drop-off in accuracy performance. Furthering the 
evaluation framework presented in this study would be valuable to the 
development of more robust and clinically relevant models used in the prediction 
of fall risk. These models could one day be applied in clinical settings to help 
better diagnose and monitor fall risk among older adults, improving the care of 
at-risk individuals and reducing the injury and associated cost of falls.

Classification Model for Differentiating Post-ACLR Individuals Using Loading 
Rate Variation.

Davidson NA, Halkiadakis YK, Morgan KD.

In post-ACLR individuals, gait variability often represents the presence of 
altered motor control. Quantifying variable limb loading is challenging, yet 
nonlinear analyses have been successful in detecting changes in gait variability 
due to altered motor control. Here, nonlinear metrics were derived and used to 
train multiple machine learning models to classify between healthy controls and 
post-ACLR individuals. The metrics were extracted from individuals' vertical 
ground reaction force data during a fast-walking trial as variable limb loading 
is exacerbated when the system is stressed and being challenged. It was 
hypothesized that effective differentiation between healthy control and 
post-ACLR individuals would be achieved using machine learning models derived 
from limb loading rate variability measures. Seventeen healthy control and 
fourteen post-ACLR participants with measured between-limb loading rate 
asymmetries completed the walking protocol. Ground reaction force data was 
collected on an instrumented treadmill where they performed walking trials at 
1.5 m/s. Nonlinear limb loading rate measures extracted from the healthy 
controls and post-ACLR participants' data served as inputs to the models in 
order to train them to distinguish between the two states. A Decision Tree 
Classifier that utilized a bagging strategy was the best model for 
distinguishing between healthy control and post-ACLR participants. The model was 
successful in classifying participants, reporting an accuracy score of 73%, 
precision score of 100%, and an AUC score of 0.77, despite the smaller dataset. 
The ability to detect and classify post-ACLR loading rate variation has 
significant clinical implications, as these methods could be implemented in 
clinical settings to diagnose pathological limb loading dynamics and/or altered 
motor control.Clinical Relevance- This classification model can be easily 
integrated into the clinic to help diagnose pathological limb loading based 
solely on vertical ground reaction forces and can aid clinicians in providing 
data-driven metrics to help inform rehabilitation decisions.

Design and Performance Evaluation of a Fully Integrated Knitted Knee Brace for 
Knee Motion Sensing.

Lau JL, Gupta U, Chia PZ, Tan YY, Soh GS, Low HY.

The use of e-textiles in wearable sensor design has recently received much 
interest in many applications, such as robotics, rehabilitation, personal 
wellness, and sports. Particularly in the rehabilitation domain, it has provided 
a potential alternative tool for telerehabilitation. In this paper, we designed 
and evaluated a knitted knee brace with interconnects, resistors, and sensors 
for real-time kinematic data acquisition. The real-time data acquisition is 
transmitted using a printed circuit board (PCB) connected to the knee brace 
through snap pins. The knitted knee brace was tested on three male and one 
female participant , aged between 30 and 50 years old. All participants were 
instructed to perform a walking activity at 1.5 km/h for a duration of 10 
seconds on the Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc (AMTI) treadmill over two 
sessions. The results demonstrated that the fully integrated knitted wearable 
knee brace could monitor and track human joint locomotion in real time with a 
standard deviation of 0.39V and 0.41V , respectively, for these two sessions. 
However, double peak signals were noticeable from the knitted knee brace at a 
mean of 80.54% during the gait cycles across the four subjects; this observation 
could be due to the coupled motion along the transverse and coronal planes 
during the activity.

A VR-based Treadmill Training System for Post-stroke Gait Rehabilitation().

Jiao Y, Dajime PF, Reading S, Zhang Y.

Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance rehabilitation by creating 
simulated multiple training environments, thereby maximizing the implementation 
of motor learning principles. However, previous use of VR-based treadmill 
training to improve post-stroke gait function is limited by high cost and a lack 
of adherence to post-stroke gait rehabilitation principles in system design. 
This paper describes the development of a gait rehabilitation system that 
integrates treadmill gait training with VR technology to create a virtual 
rehabilitation setting with gait training tasks and real-time performance 
feedback. The proposed system targets post-stroke patients and integrates 
low-cost sensor and rehabilitation principles to allow remote training and 
maximize training efficacy.Clinical Relevance-This system is developed with an 
emphasis on rehabilitation and motor learning principles.

Tracking Bilateral Lower Limb Kinematics of Distance Runners on Treadmill Using 
a Single Inertial Measurement Unit.

Patra Y, Liu Q, Chan RHM, Thomson D, Chow DHK, Fuller B, Cheung RTH.

Distance running related injuries are common, and many ailments have been 
associated with faulty posture. Conventional measurement of running kinematics 
requires sophisticated motion capture system in laboratory. In this study, we 
developed a wearable solution to accurately predict lower limb running 
kinematics using a single inertial measurement unit placed on the left lower 
leg. The running data collected from participants was used to train a model 
using long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an inter-subject 
approach that predicted lower limb kinematics with an average accuracy of 80.2%, 
85.8%, and 69.4% for sagittal hip, knee and ankle joint angles respectively for 
the ipsilateral limb. A comparable accuracy range was observed for the 
contralateral limb. The average RMSE (root mean squared error) of sagittal hip, 
knee and ankle were 8.76°, 13.13°, and 9.67° respectively for the ipsilateral 
limb. Analysis of contralateral limb kinematics was performed. The model 
established in this study can be used as a monitoring device to track essential 
running kinematics in natural running environments. Besides, the wearable 
solution can be an integral part of a real-time gait retraining biofeedback 
system for injury prevention and rehabilitation.

Measuring and Understanding the Health Impact of Greater Fatigability in Older 
Adults: A Call to Action and Opportunities.

Health, Pittsburgh, PA 15261.

Different from fatigue, an instantaneous state of tiredness, weakness and lack 
of energy, fatigability is a trait that contextualizes whole-body fatigue to the 
level of activity (i.e., intensity and duration) with which the fatigue is 
associated. Fatigability can be perceived or performance-related. Measuring 
fatigability improves upon traditional fatigue measures by accounting for 
self-pacing as older adults likely slow down or limit their daily activity to 
maintain fatigue in a tolerable range. Anchoring fatigue to activities/tasks 
improves sensitivity and allows for meaningful comparisons across 
individuals/between studies, as well as evaluating change over time and 
treatment effects. Two well-validated approaches are utilized to measure 
perceived fatigability: 1) a 5-minute slow-paced (1.5 mph/0.67 m/s, 0% grade) 
treadmill walk immediately followed by Borg rating of perceived exertion; and 2) 
a self-administered 10-item questionnaire, Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale, with 
both physical and mental subscales. Many walking-based performance fatigability 
measures are based on certain lap time or distance, while the Pittsburgh 
Performance Fatigability Index uses raw accelerometry data to quantify percent 
of cadence decline over the entire long distance walking tasks. Perceived 
fatigability prevalence ranges from 20-90% in older adults varying by assessment 
tool, and is higher with advancing age and in women compared to men. 
Fatigability is associated with physical and cognitive function, fall risk, 
mobility decline, and mortality. Unfortunately, the available research lacks 
representativeness in terms of racial and ethnic diversity. The time is now to 
incorporate our established sensitive and validated fatigability measures into 
global research and clinical practice to better understand mechanistic 
underpinnings and reveal intervention effects to reduce the burden and lessen 
the consequences of greater fatigability worldwide.

Spinal cord injuries (SCI) can result in sensory and motor dysfunctions, which 
were long considered permanent. Recent advancement in electrical neuromodulation 
has been proven to restore sensorimotor function in people with SCI. These 
stimulation protocols, however, were mostly invasive, expensive, and difficult 
to implement. In this study, transcutaneous electrical stimulation (tES) was 
used to restore over-ground walking of an individual with 21 years of chronic 
paralysis from a cervical SCI. After a total of 66 weeks of rehabilitation 
training with tES, which included standing, functional reaching, reclined 
sit-up, treadmill walking, and active biking, significant improvement in 
lower-limb volitional movements and overall light touch sensation were shown as 
measured by the International Standards for Neurological Classification of 
Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) score. By the end of the study, the participant 
could walk in a 4-m walking test with the aid of a walking frame and ankle-foot 
orthoses. The successful sensorimotor recovery of our study participant sheds 
light on the future of non-invasive neuromodulation treatment for SCI paralysis.

Inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been validated for measuring sagittal 
plane lower-limb kinematics during moderate-speed running, but their accuracy at 
maximal speeds remains less understood. This study aimed to assess IMU 
measurement accuracy during high-speed running and maximal effort sprinting on a 
curved non-motorized treadmill using discrete (Bland-Altman analysis) and 
continuous (root mean square error [RMSE], normalised RMSE, Pearson correlation, 
and statistical parametric mapping analysis [SPM]) metrics. The hip, knee, and 
ankle flexions and the pelvic orientation (tilt, obliquity, and rotation) were 
captured concurrently from both IMU and optical motion capture systems, as 20 
participants ran steadily at 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% of their maximal effort 
sprinting speed (5.36 ± 0.55, 6.02 ± 0.60, 6.66 ± 0.71, and 7.09 ± 0.73 m/s, 
respectively). Bland-Altman analysis indicated a systematic bias within ±1° for 
the peak pelvic tilt, rotation, and lower-limb kinematics and -3.3° to -4.1° for 
the pelvic obliquity. The SPM analysis demonstrated a good agreement in the hip 
and knee flexion angles for most phases of the stride cycle, albeit with 
significant differences noted around the ipsilateral toe-off. The RMSE ranged 
from 4.3° (pelvic obliquity at 70% speed) to 7.8° (hip flexion at 100% speed). 
Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.44 (pelvic tilt at 90%) to 0.99 (hip and 
knee flexions at all speeds). Running speed minimally but significantly affected 
the RMSE for the hip and ankle flexions. The present IMU system is effective for 
measuring lower-limb kinematics during sprinting, but the pelvic orientation 
estimation was less accurate.

OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effects of virtual reality-assisted gait 
adaptation training with the overground gait adaptation training on balance and 
walking in patients with stroke.
METHODS: Fifty-four eligible patients were enrolled. All patients were randomly 
divided into a virtual reality and control group, with 27 patients in each 
group. The virtual reality group received virtual reality-assisted training on 
the treadmill, whereas the control group received overground training in a 
physical therapy room. After the intervention, patients were assessed using 
walking speed, obstacle avoidance ability, Timed Up and Go test, postural 
stability, and the Barthel Index.
RESULTS: Significant improvements in walking speed, obstacle avoidance ability, 
Timed Up and Go test, and eye-opening center of pressure speed were observed 
after the intervention ( P < 0.05). No statistically significant differences 
were found in eye-closing center of pressure speed, tandem center of pressure 
speed, single-leg center of pressure speed, and Barthel Index ( P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Stroke patients may benefit from virtual reality-assisted gait 
adaptation training in improving walking and static balance function and 
reducing the risk of falls.

BACKGROUND: Biofeedback is a promising noninvasive strategy to enhance gait 
training among individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). Commonly, biofeedback 
systems are designed to guide movement correction using audio, visual, or 
sensorimotor (i.e., tactile or proprioceptive) cues, each of which has 
demonstrated measurable success in CP. However, it is currently unclear how the 
modality of biofeedback may influence user response which has significant 
implications if systems are to be consistently adopted into clinical care.
METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the extent to which adolescents with CP 
(7M/1F; 14 [12.5,15.5] years) adapted their gait patterns during treadmill 
walking (6 min/modality) with audiovisual (AV), sensorimotor (SM), and combined 
AV + SM biofeedback before and after four acclimation sessions (20 min/session) 
and at a two-week follow-up. Both biofeedback systems were designed to target 
plantarflexor activity on the more-affected limb, as these muscles are commonly 
impaired in CP and impact walking function. SM biofeedback was administered 
using a resistive ankle exoskeleton and AV biofeedback displayed soleus activity 
from electromyography recordings during gait. At every visit, we measured the 
time-course response to each biofeedback modality to understand how the rate and 
magnitude of gait adaptation differed between modalities and following 
acclimation.
RESULTS: Participants significantly increased soleus activity from baseline 
using AV + SM (42.8% [15.1, 59.6]), AV (28.5% [19.2, 58.5]), and SM (10.3% [3.2, 
15.2]) biofeedback, but the rate of soleus adaptation was faster using AV + SM 
biofeedback than either modality alone. Further, SM-only biofeedback produced 
small initial increases in plantarflexor activity, but these responses were 
transient within and across sessions (p > 0.11). Following multi-session 
acclimation and at the two-week follow-up, responses to AV and AV + SM 
biofeedback were maintained.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that AV biofeedback was critical to 
increase plantarflexor engagement during walking, but that combining AV and SM 
modalities further amplified the rate of gait adaptation. Beyond improving our 
understanding of how individuals may differentially prioritize distinct forms of 
afferent information, outcomes from this study may inform the design and 
selection of biofeedback systems for use in clinical care.

OBJECTIVE: To measure the trunk vertical displacement (VD) in horses trotting on 
a water treadmill (WT) at different water depths (WDs) and speeds.
ANIMALS: 6 sound Standardbred horses (median age 12 years [IQR:10.5-12]).
METHODS: The horses were trotted on a WT at 2 speeds (3.5 m/s and 5 m/s) and 
during 4 conditions: dry treadmill (DT), WD at mid-cannon (WD-CAN), mid-radius 
(WD-RAD), and shoulder (WD-SHOUL). The dorsoventral movement was obtained with 
accelerometers placed over the withers, thoracolumbar junction (T18), tuber 
sacrale (TS), and sacrum (S5). The VD was defined with the median value of the 
upward (Up) and downward (Down) amplitudes of the vertical excursion during each 
stride. The difference of VD at each sensor location was compared between the DT 
and the 3 WDs, and between the 2 trotting speeds for the same condition.
RESULTS: The VD amplitudes were significantly increased at any sensor location 
when trotting in water at WD-CAN and WD-RAD compared to DT (P < .05 for all), 
with the highest increase at WD-RAD and T18. When the speed increased from 3.5 
to 5 m/s, the VD amplitudes were significantly decreased at T18 at each water 
level (P = .03), and at WD-RAD only for the withers and TS (P = .03).
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Both water depth and speed affect the trunk VD in horses at 
trot on a WT with an opposite effect. The VD increases when increasing the WD up 
to mid-radius, while the VD decreases when increasing the trotting speed, with 
the main effects observed at the thoracolumbar junction.

modulation.

Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

According to the dual-axis model, running styles can be defined by cadence and 
duty factor, variables that have been associated with running performance, 
economy and injury risk. To guide runners in exploring different running styles, 
effective instructions to modulate cadence and duty factor are needed. Such 
instructions have been established for treadmill running, but not for overground 
running, during which speed can be varied. In this study, five participants 
completed eight field training sessions over a 4-week training period with 
acoustic instructions to modulate cadence, duty factor, and, in combination, 
running style. Instructions were provided via audio files. Running data were 
collected with sports watches. Participants' experiences with guided-exploration 
training were evaluated with the user experience questionnaire. Data analysis 
revealed acoustic pacing and verbal instructions to be effective in respectively 
modulating cadence and duty factor, albeit with co-varying effects on speed and 
the non-targeted variable (i.e. duty factor or cadence). Combining acoustic 
pacing and verbal instructions mitigated these co-varying effects considerably, 
allowing for running-style modulations in intended directions (particularly 
towards the styles with increased cadence and increased duty factor). User 
experience of this form of guided-exploration training was overall positive, but 
could be improved in terms of autonomy (dependability). In conclusion, combining 
acoustic pacing and verbal instructions for running-style modulation is

PURPOSE: The feasibility of ELEVATE with respect to adherence and preliminary 
efficacy was determined for children with spastic bilateral cerebral palsy (CP) 
from encephalopathy of prematurity.
METHODS: A case series was used. Participants were randomized to receive ELEVATE 
immediately or delay the intervention by 3 months before receiving the 
intervention. The outcomes included feasibility measures of (1) number of 
children recruited, (2) percentage of sessions attended, (3) stride counts 
during the intervention, and preliminary efficacy measures of change over the 
intervention period in (4) Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66), and (5) 
kinematics and weight-bearing during treadmill walking.
RESULTS: Four boys under 3 years of age participated. All participants tolerated 
60-minute intervention sessions four times/week for 12 weeks, and attended 
75%-94% (min-max) of the targeted sessions. The median step count per session 
ranged from 833 to 2484 steps (min-max) during the final week of training. 
Participants showed an increase in GMFM-66 score of 2.4-7.5 points (min-max) 
over the 3-month intervention phase, as compared to a decrease of 1.7 for one 
participant and an increase of 1.3 for another over the delay period. Three 
participants demonstrated small improvements in their gait with the 
intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Engaging young children with bilateral CP in intensive 
rehabilitation targeting gross motor function was feasible and demonstrated 
preliminary efficacy. The results have guided the design of a larger clinical 
trial to assess efficacy of early, active interventions for children with 
spastic bilateral CP.

Publisher: OBJECTIF: les chercheurs ont déterminé la faisabilité d’ELEVATE en 
matière d’adhésion et d’efficacité préliminaire chez des enfants ayant une 
paralysie cérébrale spastique bilatérale (PC) causée par une encéphalopathie de 
la prématurité.
MÉTHODOLOGIE: série de cas. Les participants ont été choisis au hasard entre 
l’utilisation immédiate d’ELEVATE ou son report de trois mois. Les résultats 
incluaient des mesures de fiabilité, soit 1) le nombre d’enfants recrutés, 2) le 
pourcentage de séances suivies, 3) le compte des foulées pendant l’intervention 
et les mesures d’efficacité préliminaire pendant la période de l’intervention 
sur le plan de 4) la mesure de la fonction motrice globale 66 (GMFM-66) et de 5) 
la cinématique et la mise en charge pendant la marche sur tapis roulant.
RÉSULTATS: quatre garçons de moins de trois ans ont participé. Tous ont toléré 
des séances d’intervention de 60 minutes quatre fois par semaine pendant 12 
semaines et ont assisté à 75 % à 94 % (minimum-maximum) des séances ciblées. Le 
compte médian de foulées par séance se situait entre 833 et 2 484 foulées 
(minimum–maximum) lors de la dernière semaine d’entraînement. Les participants 
ont présenté une augmentation de 2,4 à 7,5 points (minimum-maximum) au score du 
GMFM-66 pendant les trois mois de la phase d’intervention, par rapport à une 
diminution de 1,7 point chez un participant et à une augmentation de 1,3 point 
chez un autre pendant la période de report. Trois participants ont démonté de 
légères améliorations de leur démarche grâce à l’intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: il est faisable de faire participer des jeunes enfants ayant une PC 
bilatérale à une réadaptation intensive visant la fonction motrice globale, et 
cette intervention a une efficacité préliminaire démontrée. Les résultats ont 
entraîné la conception d’une étude clinique plus vaste pour évaluer l’efficacité 
d’interventions précoces actives chez les enfants ayant une PC bilatérale 
spastique.

BACKGROUND: Walking requires frequent maneuvers to navigate changing 
environments with shifting goals. Humans accomplish maneuvers and simultaneously 
maintain balance primarily by modulating their foot placement, but a direct 
trade-off between these two objectives has been proposed. As older adults may 
rely more on foot placement to maintain lateral balance, they may be less able 
to adequately adapt stepping to perform lateral maneuvers.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How do older adults adapt stepping to enact lateral 
lane-change maneuvers, and how do physical and perceived ability influence their 
task performance?
METHODS: Twenty young (21.7 ± 2.6 yrs) and 18 older (71.6 ± 6.0 yrs) adults 
walked on a motorized treadmill in a virtual environment. Following an audible 
and visual cue, participants switched between two parallel paths, centered 0.6 m 
apart, to continue walking on their new path. We quantified when participants 
initiated the maneuver following the cue, as well as their step width, lateral 
position, and stepping variability ellipses at each maneuver step.
RESULTS: Young and older adults did not differ in when they initiated the 
maneuver, but participants with lower perceived ability took longer to do so. 
Young and older adults also did not exhibit differences in step width or lateral 
positions at any maneuver step, but participants with greater physical ability 
reached their new path faster. While only older adults exhibited stepping 
adaptations prior to initiating the maneuver, both groups traded off stability 
for maneuverability to enact the lateral maneuver.
SIGNIFICANCE: Physical and perceived balance ability, rather than age per se, 
differentially influenced maneuver task performance. Humans must make decisions 
related to the task of walking itself and do so based on both physical and 
perceived factors. Understanding and targeting these interactions may help 
improve walking performance among older adults.

Accurate COP Trajectory Estimation in Healthy and Pathological Gait Using 
Multimodal Instrumented Insoles and Deep Learning Models.

Measuring center-of-pressure (COP) trajectories in out-of-the-lab environments 
may provide valuable information about changes in gait and balance function 
related to natural disease progression or treatment in neurological disorders. 
Traditional equipment to acquire COP trajectories includes stationary force 
plates, instrumented treadmills, electronic walkways, and insoles featuring 
high-density force sensing arrays, all of which are expensive and not widely 
accessible. This study introduces novel deep recurrent neural networks that can 
accurately estimate dynamic COP trajectories by fusing data from affordable and 
heterogeneous insole-embedded sensors (namely, an eight-cell array of force 
sensitive resistors (FSRs) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU)). The method 
was validated against gold-standard equipment during out-of-the-lab ambulatory 
tasks that simulated real-world walking. Root-mean-square errors (RMSE) in the 
mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) directions obtained from healthy 
individuals (ML: 0.51 cm, AP: 1.44 cm) and individuals with neuromuscular 
conditions (ML: 0.59 cm, AP: 1.53 cm) indicated technical validity. In 
individuals with neuromuscular conditions, COP-derived metrics showed 
significant correlations with validated clinical measures of ambulatory function 
and lower-extremity muscle strength, providing proof-of-concept evidence of the 
convergent validity of the proposed method for clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that a heuristic (i.e., evidence-based, 
rounded yet practical) cadence threshold of ≥ 100 steps/min was associated with 
absolutely-defined moderate intensity physical activity (i.e., ≥ 3 metabolic 
equivalents [METs]) in older adults 61-85 years of age. Although it was 
difficult to ascertain achievement of absolutely-defined vigorous (6 METs) 
intensity, ≥ 130 steps/min was identified as a defensible threshold for this 
population. However, little evidence exists regarding cadence thresholds and 
relatively-defined moderate intensity indicators, including ≥ 64% heart rate 
[HR] maximum [HRmax = 220-age], ≥ 40% HR reserve [HRR = HRmax-HRresting], and 
≥ 12 Borg Scale Rating of Perceived Exertion [RPE]; or vigorous intensity 
indicators including ≥ 77%HRmax, ≥ 60%HRR, and ≥ 14 RPE.
PURPOSE: To analyze the relationship between cadence and relatively-defined 
physical activity intensity and identify relatively-defined moderate and 
vigorous heuristic cadence thresholds for older adults 61-85 years of age.
METHODS: Ninety-seven ostensibly healthy adults (72.7 ± 6.9 years; 49.5% women) 
completed up to nine 5-min treadmill walking bouts beginning at 0.5 mph 
(0.8 km/h) and progressing by 0.5 mph speed increments (with 2-min rest between 
bouts). Directly-observed (and video-recorded) steps were hand-counted, HR was 
measured using a chest-strapped monitor, and in the final minute of each bout, 
participants self-reported RPE. Segmented mixed model regression and Receiver 
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses identified optimal cadence 
thresholds associated with relatively-defined moderate (≥ 64%HRmax, ≥ 40%HRR, 
and ≥ 12 RPE) and vigorous (≥ 77%HRmax, ≥ 60%HRR, and ≥ 14 RPE) intensities. A 
compromise between the two analytical methods, including Youden's Index (a sum 
of sensitivity and specificity), positive and negative predictive values, and 
overall accuracy, yielded final heuristic cadences.
RESULTS: Across all relatively-defined moderate intensity indicators, segmented 
regression models and ROC curve analyses identified optimal cadence thresholds 
ranging from 105.9 to 112.8 steps/min and 102.0-104.3 steps/min, respectively. 
Comparable values for vigorous intensity indicators ranged between126.1-132.1 
steps/min and 106.7-116.0 steps/min, respectively. Regardless of the 
relatively-defined intensity indicator, the overall best heuristic cadence 
threshold aligned with moderate intensity was ≥ 105 steps/min. Vigorous 
intensity varied between ≥ 115 (greater sensitivity) or ≥ 120 (greater 
specificity) steps/min.
CONCLUSIONS: Heuristic cadence thresholds align with relatively-defined 
intensity indicators and can be useful for studying and prescribing older 
adults' physiological response to, and/or perceived experience of, ambulatory 
physical activity.

Balance perturbations are used to study locomotor instability. However, these 
perturbations are designed to provoke a specific context of instability that may 
or may not generalize to a broader understanding of falls risk. The purpose of 
this study was to determine if the effect of balance perturbations on 
instability generalizes across contexts. 29 younger adults and 28 older adults 
completed four experimental trials, including unperturbed walking and walking 
while responding to three perturbation contexts: mediolateral optical flow, 
treadmill-induced slips, and lateral waist-pulls. We quantified the effect of 
perturbations as an absolute change in margin of stability from unperturbed 
walking. We found significant changes in mediolateral and anteroposterior margin 
of stability for all perturbations compared to unperturbed walking in both 
cohorts (p-values ≤ 0.042). In older adults, the mediolateral effects of lateral 
waist-pulls significantly correlated with those of optical flow perturbations 
and treadmill-induced slips (r ≥ 0.398, p-values ≤ 0.036). In younger adults but 
not in older adults, we found positive and significant correlations between the 
anteroposterior effect of waist-pull perturbations and optical flow 
perturbations, and the anteroposterior and mediolateral effect of 
treadmill-induced slips (r ≥ 0.428, p-values ≤ 0.021). We found no ""goldilocks"" 
perturbation paradigm to endorse that would support universal interpretations 
about locomotor instability. Building the most accurate patient profiles of 
instability likely requires a series of perturbation paradigms designed to 
emulate the variety of environmental contexts in which falls may occur.

Four Weeks of Incline Water Treadmill Exercise Can Contribute to Increase 
Epaxial Muscle Profile in Horses.

BACKGROUND: Water treadmill (WT) exercise is a popular modality for the training 
and rehabilitation of horses. However, evidence-based literature regarding the 
use of WT exercise, particularly using inclines, is lacking.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of recurring inclined 
WT sessions on equine epaxial muscle development.
METHODS: Six horses completed 24 sessions of 15 minutes of WT activity over four 
weeks. Horses walked with water at the midcannon level at a treadmill incline of 
4%. Back traces were measured at three and seven centimetres ventral to the 
dorsal midline at T5, T9, T14, and T18, prior to the first session (W0) and 
weekly for 4 weeks (W1-4).
RESULTS: Overall, the back traces demonstrated progressive increases in muscle 
development (p < 0.05), starting at W2 up to W4. At three centimetres ventral to 
the dorsal midline, the most to least significant increases in gross muscle 
development were at T18, T5, T9, and T14, respectively, and when measured at 
seven centimetres ventrally, the most to least significant increases were 
demonstrated at T5, T18, and T14. It was noted that increases in thoracic back 
profile musculature were mainly observed within two to four weeks of the WT 
intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: It has been concluded that repeated WT exercise on an inclined 
setting has a significant effect on the rate and size of growth of equine 
thoracic back profile musculature. Muscle hypertrophy due to resistance training 
in the WT starts at 2 weeks within the programme, and it progresses as exercise 
continues to be performed.

INTRODUCTION: In upright standing and walking, the motion of the body relative 
to the environment is estimated from a combination of visual, vestibular, and 
somatosensory cues. Associations between vestibular or somatosensory impairments 
and balance problems are well established, but less is known whether visual 
motion detection thresholds affect upright balance control. Typically, visual 
motion threshold values are measured while sitting, with the head fixated to 
eliminate self-motion. In this study we investigated whether visual motion 
detection thresholds: (1) can be reliably measured during standing and walking 
in the presence of natural self-motion; and (2) differ during standing and 
walking.
METHODS: Twenty-nine subjects stood on and walked on a self-paced, instrumented 
treadmill inside a virtual visual environment projected on a large dome. 
Participants performed a two-alternative forced choice experiment in which they 
discriminated between a counterclockwise (""left"") and clockwise (""right"") 
rotation of a visual scene. A 6-down 1-up adaptive staircase algorithm was 
implemented to change the amplitude of the rotation. A psychometric fit to the 
participants' binary responses provided an estimate for the detection threshold.
RESULTS: We found strong correlations between the repeated measurements in both 
the walking (R = 0.84, p < 0.001) and the standing condition (R = 0.73, p < 
0.001) as well as good agreement between the repeated measures with Bland-Altman 
plots. Average thresholds during walking (mean = 1.04°, SD = 0.43°) were 
significantly higher than during standing (mean = 0.73°, SD = 0.47°).
CONCLUSION: Visual motion detection thresholds can be reliably measured during 
both walking and standing, and thresholds are higher during walking.

BACKGROUND: Stance control knee-ankle-foot orthoses (SCKAFOs) ensure knee 
stability by locking during stance while allowing knee flexion during swing. 
Differences in function of the knee joints and building principles between 
devices may affect their effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary effectiveness of a NEURO TRONIC on 
safety outcomes, net energy cost (EC), and user experiences in individuals 
already using an E-MAG Active SCKAFO.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective uncontrolled intervention study.
METHODS: A convenience sample of 10 subjects with flaccid lower extremity muscle 
weakness, including the quadriceps, due to neuromuscular disorders already using 
an E-MAG Active SCKAFO were provided with a newly fabricated NEURO TRONIC 
SCKAFO. Outcomes included knee joint locking failures and unlocking failures 
(ULFs) (i.e., percentage of steps the knee joint failed to lock/unlock) when 
walking under challenging conditions on an instrumented treadmill while wearing 
a safety harness; net EC (J/kg per meter) assessed with a 6-min walk test at 
comfortable speed; 3D gait kinematics and kinetics; and patient-reported 
outcomes.
RESULTS: No differences between devices were found for knee joint locking 
failures (both devices 0%) and ULFs (9.9% for the NEURO TRONIC vs. 13.9% for the 
E-MAG Active SCKAFO). The mean (standard deviation) net EC with the NEURO TRONIC 
SCKAFO was 8.2% (from 3.68 [0.81] to 3.38 [0.75] J/kg per meter, p = 0.123) 
lower, although not significantly, compared with that with the E-MAG Active 
SCKAFO. Significant improvements with the NEURO TRONIC SCKAFO were found for 
ankle power ( p = 0.003), perceived walking effort ( p = 0.014), and reported 
falls ( p = 0.034).
CONCLUSION: Both the NEURO TRONIC SCKAFO and the E-MAG Active SCKAFO were safe 
in terms of knee joint locking, while ULFs were frequent with both devices. The 
net EC with the NEURO TRONIC SCKAFO decreased, although not significantly, by 
8.2%, likely due to insufficient power. Perceived walking effort was in favor of 
the NEURO TRONIC SCKAFO.

Mammals walk in different directions, such as forward and backward. In human 
infants/adults and decerebrate cats, one leg can walk forward and the other 
backward simultaneously on a split-belt treadmill, termed hybrid or 
bidirectional locomotion. The purpose of the present study was to determine if 
spinal sensorimotor circuits generate hybrid locomotion and if so, how the limbs 
remain coordinated. We tested hybrid locomotion in 11 intact cats and in five 
following complete spinal thoracic transection (spinal cats) at three treadmill 
speeds with the hindlimbs moving forward, backward or bidirectionally. All 
intact cats generated hybrid locomotion with the forelimbs on a stationary 
platform. Four of five spinal cats generated hybrid locomotion, also with the 
forelimbs on a stationary platform, but required perineal stimulation. During 
hybrid locomotion, intact and spinal cats positioned their forward and backward 
moving hindlimbs caudal and rostral to the hip, respectively. The hindlimbs 
maintained consistent left-right out-of-phase alternation in the different 
stepping directions. Our results suggest that spinal locomotor networks generate 
hybrid locomotion by following certain rules at phase transitions. We also found 
that stance duration determined cycle duration in the different locomotor 
directions/conditions, consistent with a common rhythm-generating mechanism for 
different locomotor directions. Our findings provide additional insight on how 
left-right spinal networks and sensory feedback from the limbs interact to 
coordinate the hindlimbs and provide stability during locomotion in different 
directions. KEY POINTS: Terrestrial mammals can walk forward and backward, which 
is controlled in part by spinal sensorimotor circuits. Humans and cats also 
perform bidirectional or hybrid locomotion on a split-belt treadmill with one 
leg going forward and the other going backward. We show that cats with a spinal 
transection can perform hybrid locomotion and maintain left-right out-of-phase 
coordination, indicating that spinal sensorimotor circuits can perform 
simultaneous forward and backward locomotion. We also show that the regulation 
of cycle duration and phase duration is conserved across stepping direction, 
consistent with a common rhythm-generating mechanism for different stepping 
directions. The results help us better understand how spinal networks 
controlling the left and right legs enable locomotion in different directions.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many patients with the chronic cholestatic liver disease 
primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) show fatigue and cognitive impairment that 
reduces their quality of life. Likewise, rats with bile duct ligation (BDL) are 
a model of cholestatic liver disease. Current PBC treatments do not improve 
symptomatic alterations such as fatigue or cognitive impairment and new, more 
effective treatments are therefore required. Golexanolone reduces the 
potentiation of GABAA receptors activation by neurosteroids. Golexanolone 
reduces peripheral inflammation and neuroinflammation and improves cognitive and 
motor function in rats with chronic hyperammonemia. The aims of the present 
study were to assess if golexanolone treatment improves fatigue and cognitive 
and motor function in cholestatic BDL rats and if this is associated with 
improvement of peripheral inflammation, neuroinflammation, and GABAergic 
neurotransmission in the cerebellum.
METHODS: Rats were subjected to bile duct ligation. One week after surgery, oral 
golexanolone was administered daily to BDL and sham-operated controls. Fatigue 
was analysed in the treadmill, motor coordination in the motorater, locomotor 
gait in the Catwalk, and short-term memory in the Y-maze. We also analysed 
peripheral inflammation, neuroinflammation, and GABAergic neurotransmission 
markers by immunohistochemistry and Western blot.
RESULTS: BDL induces fatigue, impairs memory and motor coordination, and alters 
locomotor gait in cholestatic rats. Golexanolone improves these alterations, and 
this was associated with improvement of peripheral inflammation, 
neuroinflammation, and GABAergic neurotransmission in the cerebellum.
CONCLUSION: Golexanolone may have beneficial effects to treat fatigue, and motor 
and cognitive impairment in patients with the chronic cholestatic liver disease 
PBC.

Studies of human locomotion have observed asymmetries in lower-limb kinematics, 
especially at the more distal joints. However, it is unclear whether these 
asymmetries are related to functional differences between the dominant and 
non-dominant limb. This study aimed to determine the effect of lower-limb 
dominance on foot kinematics during human locomotion. Range of motion for the 
metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ) and medial longitudinal arch (MLA), as well as 
time duration of windlass mechanism engagement, were recorded from healthy young 
adults (N = 12) across a range of treadmill walking and running speeds. On the 
group level, there were no differences in MPJ or MLA range of motion, or 
windlass engagement timing, between the dominant and non-dominant limb 
(p > 0.05). While not explained by limb dominance, between-limb differences in 
MPJ and MLA ranges of motion were observed for individual participants on the 
order of ∼2-6°, which could be clinically relevant or impact interpretation of 
research data.

It has been found that fractal-like patterns are present in the temporal 
structure of the variability of healthy biological rhythms, while pathology and 
disease lead to their deterioration. Interestingly, it has recently been 
suggested that these patterns in biological rhythms are related with each other, 
reflecting overall health or lack of it, due to their interaction. However, the 
underlying neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for such dependency remain 
unknown. In addition, this relationship between different elements needs to be 
first verified before we even pursue understanding their interaction. This study 
aimed to investigate the relationship between two elements of the neuromuscular 
system, gait and muscle activity variability patterns in older adults. 
Twenty-one older adults walked at their preferred walking speed on a treadmill. 
Inter-stride intervals were obtained through an accelerometer placed on the 
lateral malleoli to assess the temporal structure of variability of 
stride-to-stride fluctuations. Inter muscle peak intervals were obtained through 
the electromyographic signal of the gastrocnemius to assess the temporal 
structure of the variability of the simultaneous muscle activity. The temporal 
structure of variability from both signals was evaluated through the detrended 
fluctuation analysis, while their magnitude of variability was evaluated using 
the coefficient of variation. The Pearson's Correlation coefficient was used to 
identify the relationship between the two dependent variables. A significant 
strong positive correlation was found between the temporal structure of gait and 
muscle activity patterns. This result suggests that there is an interdependency 
between biological rhythms that compose the human neuromuscular system.

BACKGROUND: The effect of listening to audiobooks, podcasts, and other audio 
files while walking on gait performance has not been well studied. Although the 
number of audio users is growing annually. Evidence suggests that a 
posture-first strategy contributes to gait stability in healthy individuals 
during dual-task conditions, but this effect may be diminished when the 
cognitive task is consciously prioritized.
OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of listening to an audiobook while walking, as a 
daily life-like dual-task, on spatiotemporal gait parameters.
METHODS: Forty young healthy (24.05 ± 3.66) subjects participated in the study. 
Spatiotemporal gait parameters were measured for 5 min on a treadmill once 
without (single-task) and once while listening to an audiobook through over-ear 
headphones (dual-task). Measured parameters included spatiotemporal parameters, 
gait phases, maximum pressure, and dual-task cost. Data were statistically 
analyzed using SPSS software.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in any of the studied parameters 
between the single- and dual-task conditions, even though the subjective 
cognitive load of listening to audiobooks while walking was high. However, 
participants with different habits had significant differences in gait phases 
and maximum pressure. Rare listeners had a shorter stance phase, a longer swing 
phase, and a higher maximum pressure on the dominant heel. They also had 
significant differences in dual-task costs.
CONCLUSION: No differences in the spatiotemporal gait parameters for walking 
with and without listening to audiobooks, as a daily life-like dual-task, were 
observed. However, the difference between participants who listened rarely and 
participants who listened often may confirm the ""posture first"" strategy in 
young healthy people.

Treadmills are important rehabilitation tools used with or without handrails. 
The handrails could be used to attain balance, prevent falls, and improve the 
walking biomechanics of stroke survivors, but it is yet unclear how the 
treadmill handrails impact their stability margins. Here, we investigated how 3 
treadmill handrail-use conditions (no-hold, self-selected support, and light 
touch) impact stroke survivors' margins of stability (MoS). The anteroposterior 
MoS significantly increased for both legs with self-selected support while the 
mediolateral MoS of the unaffected leg decreased significantly when the 
participants walked with self-selected support in comparison to no-hold in both 
cases. We concluded that the contextual use of the handrail should guide its 
prescription for fall prevention or balance training in rehabilitation programs.

PURPOSE: Outdoor running surfaces are designed with a cross-slope, which can 
alter kinetic and kinematic gait parameters. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate running economy, gait characteristics, and muscle activation while 
running on a surface with cross-slopes similar to those encountered on roads and 
trails.
METHODS: Eleven recreational runners (females n = 6) completed 5-min running 
trials on a treadmill at 10 km h-1 with cross-slopes of 0, 1.15, 2.29, and 6 deg 
in a randomized order.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in VO2, HR, RER, or VE across 
cross-slope conditions. Compared to 0 deg of cross-slope, ground contact time 
and duty factor increased at 2.29 and 6 deg, with significant decreases in 
absolute and relative flight times. Rear foot angles increased in the upslope 
leg at 2.29 and 6 deg cross-slopes and decreased in the downslope leg at 6 deg 
compared to 0 deg of cross-slope, with differences between legs for the 2.29 and 
6 deg conditions. Knee flexion at foot strike increased in the upslope leg at a 
6 deg cross-slope. Vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius, and tibialis 
anterior activation were not affected by the cross-slope conditions. While 
cross-slopes up to 6 deg result in changes to some gait kinematics, these 
effects do not impact running economy at moderate running velocity.

BACKGROUND: The timing of the effects of botulinum toxin A on spastic muscles is 
not yet fully clarified. The goal of this study was to follow the temporal 
changes of surface electromyographic activity of lower limb muscles during 
walking, after a therapeutic dose of botulinum toxin A injected into the calf 
muscles of children with spastic cerebral palsy.
METHODS: A group of children with spastic equinus foot was administered 
botulinum toxin A into the gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis muscles. Surface 
electromyographic activity of the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius medialis, 
rectus femoris and medial hamstrings, was recorded before botulinum toxin A 
injections and after 4, 8, and 16 weeks. Children walked on ground and on a 
treadmill at an incline of 0% and 12%. The area of electromyographic activity 
and the index of muscle co-contraction were calculated for specific segments of 
gait cycle.
FINDINGS: Botulinum toxin A did not modify the speed of gait on ground. ANOVA 
showed significant differences in electromyography during the stance phase 
segments with a maximum decrease between 4 and 8 weeks' post botulinum toxin A 
and a full recovery at 16 weeks. A significant co-contraction of rectus 
femoris/gastrocnemius medialis, between 0 and 20% and 35-50% of the gait cycle, 
was observed from the 4th to the 8th week post- botulinum toxin A for both 
treadmill settings.
INTERPRETATION: The temporal identification of deterioration/recovery of 
electromyographic activity as well as of muscle co-contractions, could be key 
elements in a rehabilitation program planning combined with botulinum toxin A.

Gait variability (GV) is a crucial measure of inconsistency of muscular 
activities or body segmental movements during repeated tasks. Hence, GV might 
serve as a relevant and sensitive measure to quantify adjustments of walking 
control. However, it has not been clarified whether GV is associated with 
walking speed, a clarification needed to exploit effective better bilateral 
coordination level. For this aim, fourteen male students (age 22.4 ± 2.7 years, 
body mass 74.9 ± 6.8 kg, and body height 1.78 ± 0.05 m) took part in this study. 
After three days of walking 1 km each day at a self-selected speed (SS) on 
asphalt with an Apple Watch S. 7 (AppleTM, Cupertino, CA, USA), the participants 
were randomly evaluated on a treadmill at three different walking speed 
intensities for 10 min at each one, SS - 20%/SS + 20%/ SS, with 5 min of passive 
recovery in-between. Heart rate (HR) was monitored and normalized as %HRmax, 
while the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) (CR-10 scale) was asked after each 
trial. Kinematic analysis was performed, assessing the Contact Time (CT), Swing 
Time (ST), Stride Length (SL), Stride Cycle (SC), and Gait Variability as Phase 
Coordination Index (PCI). RPE and HR increased as the walking speed increased (p 
= 0.005 and p = 0.035, respectively). CT and SC decreased as the speed increased 
(p = 0.0001 and p = 0.013, respectively), while ST remained unchanged (p = 
0.277). SL increased with higher walking speed (p = 0.0001). Conversely, PCI was 
3.81 ± 0.88% (high variability) at 3.96 ± 0.47 km·h-1, 2.64 ± 0.75% (low 
variability) at SS (4.94 ± 0.58 km·h-1), and 3.36 ± 1.09% (high variability) at 
5.94 ± 0.70 km·h-1 (p = 0.001). These results indicate that while the metabolic 
demand and kinematics variables change linearly with increasing speed, the most 
effective GV was observed at SS. Therefore, SS could be a new methodological 
approach to choose the individual walking speed, normalize the speed intensity, 
and avoid a gait pattern alteration.

BMI-matched normal- (NGT, n = 10, 41 ± 4y, 35.6 ± 3.0 kg/m2 ) and 
abnormal-glucose-tolerant (AGT, n = 16, 51 ± 3y, 34.3 ± 1.5 kg/m2 ) participants 
were evaluated for body composition, metabolic health (oral glucose tolerance 
test [OGTT]), and VO2 max. Participants also completed a treadmill walking test 
at 65% VO2 max for 30 min. Total sRAGE, esRAGE, sTLR2, and sTLR4 were assessed 
via ELISA, and cRAGE was calculated. AGT exhibited greater (p < 0.05) body fat % 
(+24%), fasting plasma glucose (+37%), OGTT AUC (+59%), and HOMA-IR (+55%) and 
lower (p < 0.05) VO2 max (-24%). sTLR2 was 33% lower in AGT than NGT (main 
effect, p = 0.034). However, sTLR2 did not change (p > 0.05) following AE. sTLR4 
tended to be 36% lower in AGT than NGT (main effect, p = 0.096) and did not 
change following AE (p > 0.05). Total sRAGE and isoforms were similar (p > 0.05) 
between groups and did not change following AE (p > 0.05). sTLR2 was correlated 
with (p < 0.05) basal BG (r = -0.505) and OGTT AUC (r = -0.687). sTLR4 was 
correlated with basal BG (p < 0.10, r = -0.374) and OGTT AUC (p < 0.05, 
r = -0.402). Linear regressions were predictive of sTLRs in the basal state 
(sTLR2: R2  = 0.641, p = 0.01; sTLR4: R2  = 0.566, p = 0.037) and after acute 
exercise state (sTLR2: R2  = 0.681, p = 0.004, sTLR4: R2  = 0.568, 
p = 0.036).These findings show circulating sTLR profiles are disrupted in AGT 
and acute AE minimally modulates their levels.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of arm- and 
back-support exoskeletons on reactive balance after slip-like and trip-like 
perturbations on a treadmill. Twenty-eight participants used two arm-support 
exoskeletons and two back-support exoskeletons with support (i.e., assistive 
joint torque) activated or deactivated. In each exoskeleton condition, as well 
in as a control without any exoskeleton, participants were exposed to 12 
treadmill perturbations during upright standing. The exoskeletons did not 
significantly increase the probability of a failed recovery after the 
perturbations compared to wearing no exoskeleton, but did elicit effects on 
kinematic variables that suggested balance recovery was more challenging. 
Moreover, reactive balance differed when wearing back-support and arm-support 
exoskeletons, and when wearing an activated exoskeleton compared to a 
deactivated exoskeleton. Together, our results suggest these exoskeletons may 
increase the risk of slip- and trip-induced falls. The potential mechanisms of 
this increased risk are discussed and include the added mass and/or motion 
restrictions associated with wearing these exoskeletons. Our results do not 
support the assistive hip/back extension moment provided by back-support 
exoskeletons adversely affecting fall risk.

Joint kinematics are an important and widely utilized metric in quantitative 
human movement analysis. Typically, trajectory data for skin-mounted markers are 
collected using stereophotogrammetry, sometimes referred to as optical motion 
capture, and processed using various mathematical models to estimate joint 
kinematics (e.g., angles). Among the various sources of noise in optical motion 
capture data, soft tissue artifacts (STAs) remain a critical source of error. 
This study investigates the performance of the point cluster technique (PCT), an 
extension of the PCT using perturbation theory (PCT-PT), and singular value 
decomposition least squares (SVD-LS) method (as a reference) for 100 different 
marker configurations on the thigh and shank during treadmill walking. This 
study provides additional evidence that the PCT method is significantly limited 
by the underlying mathematical constraints governing its optimization process. 
Furthermore, the results suggest the PCT-PT method outperforms the PCT method 
across all performance metrics for both body segments during the entire gait 
cycle. For position-based metrics, the PCT-PT method provides better estimates 
than the SVD-LS method for the thigh during majority of the stance phase and 
provides comparable estimates for the shank during the entire gait cycle. For 
knee angle estimates, the PCT-PT method provides equivalent results as the 
SVD-LS method.

AIM: Assess the effect of low- and high-volume blood flow restriction training 
(BFR) on maximal aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and determine if alteration in VO2 
max is mediated through changes in hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) and blood volume.
METHODS: Participants' Hbmass (CO-rebreathe), single, and double-leg VO2 max and 
blood volume regulating hormonal responses (renin and copeptin) were measured 
before and after BFR training. Training consisted of treadmill walking either 
(1) twice-daily for 4week (CON and BFRHV ) or (2) twice-weekly for 6week (BFRLV 
). Each session consisted of five intervals (3 min, 5% incline, 5 km/h, 100% of 
lowest occlusion pressure), with 1 min of standing rest between sets.
RESULTS: VO2 max increased using both training exposures, in as quickly as 
2-weeks (BFRLV baseline to 4week: +315 ± 241 mL (8.7%), p = 0.02; BFRHV baseline 
to 2week: +360 ± 261 mL (7.9%), p < 0.01), for the BFRLV and BFRHV groups, with 
no change in CON. Single- and double-leg VO2 max improved proportionately 
(single/double-leg VO2 max ratio: BFRLV 78 ± 4.9-78 ± 5.8%, BFRHV 
79 ± 6.5-77 ± 6.5%), suggesting that the mechanism for increased VO2 max is not 
solely limited to central or peripheral adaptations. Hbmass remained unchanged 
across groups (CON: +10.2 ± 34 g, BFRLV : +6.6 ± 42 g, BFRHV : +3.2 ± 44 g; 
p = 0.9), despite a significant release of blood volume regulating hormones 
after initial BFR exposure (renin +20.8 ± 21.9 ng/L, p < 0.01; copeptin 
+22.0 ± 23.8 pmol/L, p < 0.01), which was blunted following BFRHV training 
(renin: +13.4 ± 12.4 ng/L, p = 0.09; copeptin: +1.9 ± 1.7 pmol/L, p = 0.98).
CONCLUSION: BFR treadmill walking increases VO2 max irrespective of changes in 
Hbmass or blood volume despite a large release of blood volume regulating 
hormones in response to BFR treadmill walking.

The Lokomat provides task-oriented therapy for patients with gait disorders. 
This robotic technology drives the lower limbs in the sagittal plane. However, 
normative gait also involves motions in the coronal and transverse planes. This 
study aimed to compare the Lokomat with Treadmill gait through three-dimensional 
(3D)-joint kinematics and inter-joint coordination. Lower limb kinematics was 
recorded in 18 healthy participants who walked at 3 km/h on a Treadmill or in a 
Lokomat with nine combinations of Guidance (30%, 50%, 70%) and bodyweight 
support (30%, 50%, 70%). Compared to the Treadmill, the Lokomat altered pelvic 
rotation, decreased pelvis obliquity and hip adduction, and increased ankle 
rotation. Moreover, the Lokomat resulted in significantly slower velocity at the 
hip, knee, and ankle flexion compared to the treadmill condition. Moderate to 
strong correlations were observed between the Treadmill and Lokomat conditions 
in terms of inter-joint coordination between hip-knee (r = 0.67-0.91), hip-ankle 
(r = 0.66-0.85), and knee-ankle (r = 0.90-0.95). This study showed that some 
gait determinants, such as pelvis obliquity, rotation, and hip adduction, are 
altered when walking with Lokomat in comparison to a Treadmill. Kinematic 
deviations induced by the Lokomat were most prominent at high levels of 
bodyweight support. Interestingly, different levels of Guidance did not affect 
gait kinematics. The present results can help therapists to adequately select 
settings during Lokomat therapy.

Falling is a major cause of morbidity, and is often caused by a decrease in 
postural stability. A key component of postural stability is whole-body 
centroidal angular momentum, which can be influenced by control moment 
gyroscopes. In this proof-of-concept study, we explore the influence of our 
wearable robotic gyroscopic actuator ""GyroPack"" on the balance performance and 
gait characteristics of non-impaired individuals (seven female/eight male, 30 ± 
7 years, 68.8 ± 8.4 kg). Participants performed a series of balance and walking 
tasks with and without wearing the GyroPack. The device displayed various 
control modes, which were hypothesised to positively, negatively, or neutrally 
impact postural control. When configured as a damper, the GyroPack increased 
mediolateral standing time and walking distance, on a balance beam, and 
decreased trunk angular velocity variability, while walking on a treadmill. When 
configured as a negative damper, both peak trunk angular rate and trunk angular 
velocity variability increased during treadmill walking. This exploratory study 
shows that gyroscopic actuators can influence balance and gait kinematics. Our 
results mirror the findings of our earlier studies; though, with more than 50% 
mass reduction of the device, practical and clinical applicability now appears 
within reach.

Gait variability of outdoor vs treadmill walking with bilateral robotic ankle 
exoskeletons under proportional myoelectric control.

Lower limb robotic exoskeletons are often studied in the context of steady-state 
treadmill walking in laboratory environments. However, the end goal of these 
devices is often adoption into our everyday lives. To move outside of the 
laboratory, there is a need to study exoskeletons in real world, complex 
environments. One way to study the human-machine interaction is to look at how 
the exoskeleton affects the user's gait. In this study we assessed changes in 
gait spatiotemporal variability when using a robotic ankle exoskeleton under 
proportional myoelectric control both inside on a treadmill and outside 
overground. We hypothesized that walking with the exoskeletons would not lead to 
significant changes in variability inside on a treadmill or outside compared to 
not using the exoskeletons. In addition, we hypothesized that walking outside 
would lead to higher variability both with and without the exoskeletons compared 
to treadmill walking. In support of our hypothesis, we found significantly 
higher coefficients of variation of stride length, stance time, and swing time 
when walking outside both with and without the exoskeleton. We found a 
significantly higher variability when using the exoskeletons inside on the 
treadmill, but we did not see significantly higher variability when walking 
outside overground. The value of this study to the literature is that it 
emphasizes the importance of studying exoskeletons in the environment in which 
they are meant to be used. By looking at only indoor gait spatiotemporal 
measures, we may have assumed that the exoskeletons led to higher variability 
which may be unsafe for certain target populations. In the context of the 
literature, we show that variability due to robotic ankle exoskeletons under 
proportional myoelectric control does not elicit different changes in stride 
time variability than previously found in other daily living tasks (uneven 
terrain, load carriage, or cognitive tasks).

INTRODUCTION: In addition to its effects on cognitive awareness, smartphone use 
while walking may reduce the speed, regularity, and symmetry of walking. 
Although its effects on spatiotemporal gait parameters, such as walking speed 
and step width, have already been studied, little is currently known about the 
impact of smartphone dual tasking on lower limb kinetics.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Does smartphone use during walking alter gait patterns (i.e., 
walking speed and step width) and consequently external knee moments?
METHODS: In a four-period crossover trial, external knee moment peaks, walking 
speed, and step width were assessed in 27 healthy adults during matched-speed 
walking, self-paced walking, self-paced walking with spoken calculation tasks, 
and self-paced walking with smartphone-entered calculation tasks. Differences 
between the smartphone use condition and all other conditions were determined 
using repeated measures ANOVA with predefined contrasts.
RESULTS: Decreased walking speed and increased step width were observed during 
smartphone use. The mean external knee abduction moment peak (Nm/kg) differed 
significantly (p < 0.01) across the intervention condition, namely walking with 
smartphone-entered calculations (0.15; 95 % CI: 0.12, 0.18), and the control 
conditions, namely matched-speed walking (0.11; 95 % CI: 0.08, 0.13), self-paced 
walking (0.11; 95 % CI: 0.09, 0.14), and walking with spoken calculations (0.14; 
95 % CI: 0.12, 0.16). After confounder adjustment for walking speed, step width, 
gender, and age, this primary outcome was significantly different between using 
the smartphone and self-paced walking (p < 0.01, r = 0.51). This effect size was 
reduced when comparing smartphone use with spoken calculations (p = 0.04, 
r = 0.32).
CONCLUSION: When using a smartphone while walking, walking speed is slowed down, 
step width is increased, and knee moments are adversely altered compared to 
walking without dual tasking. These altered knee moments are partially, but not 
entirely, attributable to the cognitive calculation task. These effects are 
age-independent, but women are more affected than men. Nevertheless, it remains 
unclear whether sustained walking while using a smartphone adversely affects the 
development of knee joint pathologies.

Vigorous physical activity has been associated with a reduced risk of developing 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, whether high-intensity interval training 
(HIIT) reduces OSA severity remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to 
investigate the impact of 12 weeks of HIIT on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and 
sleep parameters in participants with moderate-severe OSA. In this randomized 
controlled trial, 36 adults (19 males; 52.2 ± 9.8 years; body mass 
index = 34.2 ± 5.8) with moderate to severe OSA (AHI = 42.0 ± 22.9 e/h) were 
randomly assigned to HIIT [5 periods of 4 min of walking or running on a 
treadmill at 90-95 % of maximum heart rate (HRmax) interspersed with 3 min of 
walking at 50-55 % of HRmax performed three times per week for 12 weeks] or a 
control group (CG; stretching exercises performed two times per week for 12 
weeks). Sleep parameters were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks through 
overnight polysomnography. Generalized estimated equations assessed differences 
between groups over time. There was not group × time interaction for body mass 
index between groups (p = 0.074). However, significant group × time interactions 
were observed for AHI (CG change = 8.2 ± 3.7, HIIT change = -8.6 ± 4.8; 
p = 0.005), SaO2 minimum (CG change = -1.6 ± 1.6 %, HIIT change = 0.4 ± 2.3 %; 
p = 0.030), total sleep time (CG change = -31.5 ± 19.5 min, HIIT 
change = 33.7 ± 19.3 min; p = 0.049), and sleep efficiency (CG 
change = -3.2 ± 4.4 %, HIIT change = 9.9 ± 3.5 %; p = 0.026). Moreover, there 
was a significant time × group interaction for maximum oxygen consumption 
(VO2max; CG change = -1.1 ± 1.0 mL/kg/min, HIIT change = 4.8 ± 0.9 mL/kg/min; 
p < 0.001)]. However, In patients with OSA, 12 weeks of HIIT decreases sleep 
apnea severity, improves sleep quality, and cardiorespiratory fitness. CLINICAL

BACKGROUND: The exercise strategy that yields the greatest improvement in both 
cardiorespiratory fitness (V̇O2peak) and walking capacity poststroke has not 
been determined. This study aimed to determine whether conventional 
moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) or high-intensity interval 
training (HIIT) have different effects on V̇O2peak and 6-minute walk distance 
(6MWD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this 24-week superiority trial, people with poststroke 
gait dysfunction were randomized to MICT (5 days/week) or HIIT (3 days/week with 
2 days/week of MICT). MICT trained to target intensity at the ventilatory 
anaerobic threshold. HIIT trained at the maximal tolerable treadmill speed/grade 
using a novel program of 2 work-to-recovery protocols: 30:60 and 
120:180 seconds. V̇O2 and heart rate was measured during performance of the 
exercise that was prescribed at 8 and 24 weeks for treatment fidelity. Main 
outcomes were change in V̇O2peak and 6MWD. Assessors were blinded to the 
treatment group for V̇O2peak but not 6MWD. Secondary outcomes were change in 
ventilatory anaerobic threshold, cognition, gait-economy, 10-meter 
gait-velocity, balance, stair-climb performance, strength, and quality-of-life. 
Among 47 participants randomized to either MICT (n=23) or HIIT (n=24) (mean age, 
62±11 years; 81% men), 96% completed training. In intention-to-treat analysis, 
change in V̇O2peak for MICT versus HIIT was 2.4±2.7 versus 5.7±3.1 mL·kg-1·min-1 
(mean difference, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.5-4.8]; P<0.001), and change in 6MWD was 
70.9±44.3 versus 83.4±53.6 m (mean difference, 12.5 [95% CI, -17 to 42]; 
P=0.401). HIIT had greater improvement in ventilatory anaerobic threshold (mean 
difference, 2.07 mL·kg-1·min-1 [95% CI, 0.59-3.6]; P=0.008). No other 
between-group differences were observed. During V̇O2 monitoring at 8 and 24 
weeks, MICT reached 84±14% to 87±18% of V̇O2peak while HIIT reached 101±22% to 
112±14% of V̇O2peak (during peak bouts).
CONCLUSIONS: HIIT resulted in more than a 2-fold greater and clinically 
important change in V̇O2peak than MICT. Training to target (ventilatory 
anaerobic threshold) during MICT resulted in ~3 times the minimal clinically 
important difference in 6MWD, which was similar to HIIT. These findings show 
proof of concept that HIIT yields greater improvements in cardiorespiratory 
fitness than conventional MICT in appropriately screened individuals.

Novel Design and Implementation of a Neuromuscular Controller on a Hip 
Exoskeleton for Partial Gait Assistance.

Messara S, Manzoori AR, Di Russo A, Ijspeert A, Bouri M.

Exoskeletons intended for partial assistance of walking should be able to follow 
the gait pattern of their users, via online adaptive control strategies rather 
than imposing predefined kinetic or kinematic profiles. NeuroMuscular 
Controllers (NMCs) are adaptive strategies inspired by the neuromuscular 
modeling methods that seek to mimic and replicate the behavior of the human 
nervous system and skeletal muscles during gait. This study presents a novel 
design of a NMC, applied for the first time to partial assistance hip 
exoskeletons. Rather than the two-phase (stance/swing) division used in previous 
designs for the modulation of reflexes, a 5-state finite state machines is 
designed for gait phase synchronisation. The common virtual muscle model is also 
modified by assuming a stiff tendon, allowing for a more analytical computation 
approach for the muscle state resolution. As a first validation, the performance 
of the controller was tested with 9 healthy subjects walking at different speeds 
and slopes on a treadmill. The generated torque profiles show similarity to 
biological torques and optimal assistance profiles in the literature. Power 
output profiles of the exoskeleton indicate good synchronization with the users' 
intended movements, reflected in predominantly positive work by the assistance. 
The results also highlight the adaptability of the controller to different users 
and walking conditions, without the need for extensive parameter tuning.

Why Hard Code the Bionic Limbs When They Can Learn From Humans?

Dey S, De Schultz N, Schilling AF.

In this paper, we propose a task-generic learning-based model for the control of 
a powered ankle exoskeleton. In contrast to the traditional state machine-based 
control approaches that hard codes the transition heuristics for the different 
states and motion conditions during gait, we propose to learn the finer 
constraints of gait from multiple demonstrations of human gait. We validate our 
proposed approach on a dataset of ten subjects walking on various inclines and 
at multiple speeds. We deploy our model on an ankle exoskeleton, and conduct 
user studies on able-bodied subjects who perform gait scenarios across varying 
speeds and inclines. We conduct multiple online experiments to validate our 
learning-based approach for different motion conditions, e.g., normal walking, 
walking at different speeds and inclines, turns, cross-overs with variable speed 
and cadence, walking on a treadmill as well as on level ground. We find that our 
proposed learning-based model has the capability to extrapolate its learned 
decision rules to support untrained gait conditions, for, e.g., walking at 
higher speeds and inclines not seen during training. The subjects were able to 
adapt to the different gait scenarios comfortably without loss of stability.

Biomechanics of Exoskeleton-Assisted Treadmill Walking.

Di Tommaso F, Tamburella F, Lorusso M, Gastaldi L, Molinari M, Tagliamonte NL.

To exploit the benefits of treadmill-based exoskeletons, it is crucial to assess 
possible deviations from natural walking depending on assistive parameters. This 
study evaluated the biomechanics of exoskeleton-assisted treadmill walking by 
comparing it with free gait. Five healthy participants walked freely on a 
treadmill and with the assistance of the Lokomat gait trainer, while changing 
Body Weight Support (BWS), Gait Speed (GS), and Guidance Force (GF). Results 
showed that the hip and knee joint kinematics depended on BWS and GS, while 
changes due to GF were limited. Moreover, joint kinematics and the activity of 
related muscles were altered with respect to free gait, for any combination of 
robot parameters in the case of the ankle, and especially for low GS and with 
BWS in the case of hip and knee. Overall, walking with the Lokomat can mostly 
resemble free gait at high speed and without BWS.

Predictive Control of Peak Achilles Tendon Force in a Simulated System of the 
Human Ankle Joint with a Parallel Artificial Actuator During Hopping.

Nabipour M, Sawicki GS, Sartori M.

Latest advances in wearable exoskeletons for the human lower extremity 
predominantly focus on minimising metabolic cost of walking. However, there 
currently is no robotic exoskeleton that gains control on the mechanics of 
biological tissues such as biological muscles or series-elastic tendons. 
Achieving robotic control of biological tissue mechanics would enable prevention 
of musculoskeletal injuries or the personalization of rehabilitation treatments 
following injury with levels of precisions not attained before. In this paper, 
we introduce a new framework that uses nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) 
for the closed-loop control of peak tendon force in a simulated system of the 
human ankle joint with parallel exoskeletal actuation. We propose a 
computationally efficient NMPC's inner model consisting of explicit, closed-form 
equations of muscle-tendon dynamics along with those of the ankle joint with 
parallel actuation. The proposed formulation is tested and verified on movement 
data collected during dynamic ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion rotations 
executed on a dynamometer as well as during walking and running on a treadmill. 
The framework designed using the NMPC controller showed a promising performance 
in keeping the Achilles tendon force under a predefined threshold. Results 
indicated that our proposed model was generalizable to different muscles and 
gaits and suitable for real-time applications due to its low computational time.

Augmented Reality Feedback for Exoskeleton-Assisted Walking. A Feasibility 
Study.

Pinto-Fernandez D, Gomez M, Rodrigues C, Rojo A, Raya R, Rocon E, Moreno JC, 
Torricelli D.

Powered lower limb exoskeletons have been used in recent decades to support and 
improve conventional gait rehabilitation programs. In this context, visual 
feedback is considered a valuable tool to facilitate patient learning and 
engagement. Treadmill-based lower limb robotic exoskeletons are commonly 
incorporated with traditional screens or virtual reality (VR) devices. However, 
these modalities are incompatible with over-ground robotic exoskeletons, in 
which users should pay attention to multiple elements of the open environment 
and more complex tasks. Recent advances in augmented reality (AR) technology 
have unlocked a new way of displaying 3D graphics in untethered wearable devices 
like Microsoft's Hololens 2 without occluding the rest of the user's field of 
view. These advances can be crucial in certain situations and position AR as an 
excellent candidate to improve visual feedback when using robotic exoskeletons. 
In this work, we present the development of an AR-based audio-visual feedback 
system that tracks the trunk rotation from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to 
aid in walking tasks assisted by a lower limb robotic exoskeleton. A preliminary 
study was done integrating the H3 robotic exoskeleton with Hololens 2. We 
observed that displaying posture information is feasible and could help mitigate 
the unnatural posture often imposed by a robotic exoskeleton.

Late-life balance disorders remain a severe problem with fatal consequences. 
Perturbation-based balance training (PBT), a form of rehabilitation that 
intentionally introduces small, unpredictable disruptions to an individual's 
gait cycle, can improve balance. The Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD) is a 
cable-driven robotic trainer that applies perturbations to the user's pelvis 
during treadmill walking. Earlier work showcased improved gait stability and the 
first evidence of increased cognition acutely. The mobile Tethered Pelvic Assist 
Device (mTPAD), a portable version of the TPAD, applies perturbations to a 
pelvic belt via a posterior walker during overground gait, as opposed to 
treadmill walking. Forty healthy older adults were randomly assigned to a 
control group (CG, n = 20) without mTPAD PBT or an experimental group (EG, 
n = 20) with mTPAD PBT for a two-day study. Day 1 consisted of baseline 
anthropometrics, vitals, and functional and cognitive measurements. Day 2 
consisted of training with the mTPAD and post-interventional cognitive and 
functional measurements. Results revealed that the EG significantly outperformed 
the CG in several cognitive (SDMT-C and TMT-B) and functional (BBS and 4-Stage 
Balance: one-foot stand) measurements while showcasing increased confidence in 
mobility based on FES-I. To our knowledge, our study is the first randomized, 
large group (n = 40) clinical study exploring new mobile perturbation-based 
robotic gait training technology.

Corticospinal drive during walking is reduced in older adults compared with 
young adults, but it is not clear how this decrease might compromise one's 
ability to adjust stepping, particularly during visuomotor adaptation. We 
hypothesize that age-related changes in corticospinal drive could predict 
differences in older adults' step length and step time adjustments in response 
to visual perturbations compared with younger adults. Healthy young (n = 21; age 
18-33 yr) and older adults (n = 20; age 68-80 yr) were tested with a treadmill 
task, incorporating visual feedback of the foot position and stepping targets in 
real-time. During adaptation, the visuomotor gain was reduced on one side, 
causing the foot cursor and step targets to move slower on that side of the 
screen (i.e., split-visuomotor adaptation). Corticospinal drive was quantified 
by coherence between electromyographic signals in the beta-gamma frequency band 
(15-45 Hz). The results showed that 1) older adults adapted to visuomotor 
perturbations during walking, with a similar reduction in error asymmetry 
compared with younger adults; 2) however, older adults showed reduced adaptation 
in step time symmetry, despite demonstrating similar adaptation in step length 
asymmetry compared with younger adults; and 3) smaller overall changes in step 
time asymmetry was associated with reduced corticospinal drive to the tibialis 
anterior in the slow leg during split-visuomotor adaptation. These findings 
suggest that changes in corticospinal drive may affect older adults' control of 
step timing in response to visual challenges. This could be important for safe 
navigation when walking in different environments or dealing with unexpected 
circumstances.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Corticospinal input is essential for visually 
guided walking, especially when the walking pattern must be modified to 
accurately step on safe locations. Age-related changes in corticospinal drive 
are associated with inflexible step time, which necessitates different locomotor 
adaptation strategies in older adults.

The limited portability of pneumatic pumps presents a challenge for ankle-foot 
orthosis actuated by pneumatic actuators. The high-pressure requirements and 
time delay responses of pneumatic actuators necessitate a powerful and large 
pump, which renders the entire device heavy and inconvenient to carry. In this 
paper, we propose and validate a concept that enhances portability by employing 
a slack cable tendon mechanism. By managing slack tension properly, the time 
delay response problem of pneumatic actuators is eliminated through early 
triggering, and the system can be effectively controlled to generate the desired 
force for dorsiflexion assistance. The current portable integration of the 
system weighs approximately 1.6 kg, with distribution of 0.5 kg actuation part 
on the shank and 1.1 kg power system on the waist, excluding the battery. A 
mathematical model is developed to determine the proper triggering time and 
volumetric flow rate requirements for pump selection. To evaluate the 
performance of this actuation system and mathematical model, the artificial 
muscle's response time and real volumetric flow rate were preliminarily tested 
with different portable pumps on a healthy participant during treadmill walking 
at various speeds ranging from 0.5 m/s to 1.75 m/s. Two small pumps, 
specifically VN-C1 (5.36 L/min, 300 g) and VN-C4 (9.71L/min, 550 g), meet our 
design criteria, and then tested on three healthy subjects walking at normal 
speeds of 1 m/s and 1.5 m/s. The kinematic and electromyographic results 
demonstrate that the device can facilitate ankle dorsiflexion with a portable 
pump (300-500 g), generating sufficient force to lift up the foot segment, and 
reducing muscle activity responsible for ankle dorsiflexion during the swing 
phase by 8% and 10% at normal speeds of 1 m/s and 1.5 m/s respectively. This 
portable ankle robot, equipped with a compact pump weighing approximately 
1.6 kg, holds significant potential for assisting individuals with lower limb 
weakness in walking, both within their homes and in clinical settings.

Multifractality in stride-to-stride variations reveals that walking involves 
more movement tuning and adjusting than running.

Introduction: The seemingly periodic human gait exhibits stride-to-stride 
variations as it adapts to the changing task constraints. The optimal movement 
variability hypothesis (OMVH) states that healthy stride-to-stride variations 
exhibit ""fractality""-a specific temporal structure in consecutive strides that 
are ordered, stable but also variable, and adaptable. Previous research has 
primarily focused on a single fractality measure, ""monofractality."" However, 
this measure can vary across time; strideto-stride variations can show 
""multifractality."" Greater multifractality in stride-tostride variations would 
highlight the ability to tune and adjust movements more. Methods: We 
investigated monofractality and multifractality in a cohort of eight healthy 
adults during self-paced walking and running trials, both on a treadmill and 
overground. Footfall data were collected through force-sensitive sensors 
positioned on their heels and feet. We examined the effects of self-paced 
walking vs. running and treadmill vs. overground locomotion on the measure of 
monofractality, α-DFA, in addition to the multifractal spectrum width, W, and 
the asymmetry in the multifractal spectrum, WAsym, of stride interval time 
series. Results: While the α-DFA was larger than 0.50 for almost all conditions, 
α-DFA was higher in running and locomoting overground than walking and 
locomoting on a treadmill. Similarly, W was greater while locomoting overground 
than on a treadmill, but an opposite trend indicated that W was greater in 
walking than running. Larger WAsym values in the negative direction suggest that 
walking exhibits more variation in the persistence of shorter stride intervals 
than running. However, the ability to tune and adjust movements does not differ 
between treadmill and overground, although both exhibit more variation in the 
persistence of shorter stride intervals. Discussion: Hence, greater 
heterogeneity in shorter than longer stride intervals contributed to greater 
multifractality in walking compared to running, indicated by larger negative 
WAsym values. Our results highlight the need to incorporate multifractal methods 
to test the predictions of the OMVH.

BACKGROUND: Exercise transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement (Exercise-TcPO2) 
can be used to diagnose Lower Extremity Artery Disease (LEAD) and allows the 
quantification of limb ischemia during exercise on treadmill. Exercise-TcPO2 
test-retest reliability in patients with LEAD and severe walking impairment is 
unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability, 
standard error of measurement (SEM), and Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) of 
exercise-TcPO2 in patients with claudication.
METHODS: Data were collected from patients that performed 2 treadmill tests 
within a 1-month interval. Delta from Rest of Oxygen Pressure (DROP) values were 
measured at both buttocks (proximal) and both calves (distal). Test-retest 
reproducibility was assessed by recording transcutaneous oximetry measurements 
twice and expressed as SEM and intra-class correlation coefficients. MDC was 
calculated using the formula MDC = SEM x 1.96 x √ 2.
RESULTS: Twenty eight LEAD patients (61 ± 9 years old) were included. 
Intra-class correlation coefficients were 0.66 [0.50, 0.79] and 0.65 [0.49, 
0.79] for the proximal and distal levels, respectively. The SEM of DROP at the 
proximal and distal levels were 7 [6, 9] mm Hg and 9 [8, 11] mm Hg, 
respectively. The SEM for all (proximal and distal) DROP values was 8 [7, 10] mm 
Hg and the MDC of DROP was 23 mm Hg.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise-TcPO2 with measurement of DROP values has a moderate 
test-retest reliability in LEAD patients with a maximal walking distance ≤ 300m. 
For an individual, an improvement or deterioration in DROP of ≥ 23 mm Hg after 
an intervention would be required to be 95% confident that the change is 
significant. It should be considered in evaluating the impact of treatment in 
patients with claudication.

PURPOSE: To develop a virtual reality (VR) based intervention targeting 
community walking requirements.
METHODS: Two focus groups each involving 7 clinicians allowed exploring optimal 
features, needed support and perceived favorable/unfavorable factors associated 
with the use of the VR-based intervention from the clinicians' perspective. 
Three stroke survivors and 2 clinicians further interacted with the intervention 
and filled questionnaires related to acceptability and favorable/unfavorable 
perceptions on the VR intervention. Stroke participants additionally rated their 
perceived effort (NASA Tax Load Index), presence (Slater-Usoh-Steed) and 
cybersickness (Simulator Sickness Questionnaire).
RESULTS: Results identified optimal features (patient eligibility criteria, task 
complexity), needed support (training, human assistance), as well as favorable 
(cognitive stimulation, engagement, representativeness of therapeutic goals) and 
unfavorable factors (misalignment with a natural walking pattern, client 
suitability, generalization to real-life) associated with the intervention. 
Acceptability scores following the interaction with the tool were 28 and 42 (max 
56) for clinicians and ranged from 43 to 52 for stroke participants. Stroke 
participants reported moderate perceptions of effort (range:20-33/max:60), high 
levels of presence (29-42/42) and minimal cybersickness (0-3/64).
CONCLUSION: Findings collected in the early development phase of the VR 
intervention will allow addressing favorable/unfavorable factors and 
incorporating desired optimal features, prior to conducting effectiveness and 
implementation studies.

Plain Language Summary: This study presents the development process of a new 
virtual reality (VR) intervention for community walking and participation in 
stroke survivors.Results from the focus group and hands-on pilot trial suggest 
that the VR intervention is feasible and accepted by clinicians and stroke 
survivors.Addressing favorable/unfavorable factors and incorporating features 
desired by clinicians in the development of the VR tool should promote its 
eventual implementation in clinical setting.

Falls are a problem, especially for older adults. Placing our feet accurately 
relative to the center-of-mass helps us to prevent falling during gait. The 
degree of foot placement control with respect to the center-of mass kinematic 
state is decreased in older as compared to young adults. Here, we attempted to 
train mediolateral foot placement control in healthy older adults. Ten older 
adults trained by walking on shoes with a narrow ridge underneath (LesSchuh), 
restricting mediolateral center-of-pressure shifts. As a training effect, we 
expected improved foot placement control during normal walking. A training 
session consisted of a normal walking condition, followed by a training 
condition on LesSchuh and finally an after-effect condition. Participants 
performed six of such training sessions, spread across three weeks. As a 
control, before the first training session, we included two similar sessions, 
but on normal shoes only. We evaluated whether a training effect was observed 
across sessions and weeks in a repeated-measures design. Whilst walking with 
LesSchuh, the magnitude of foot placement error reduced half-a-millimeter 
between sessions within a week (cohen's d = 0.394). As a training effect in 
normal walking, the magnitude of foot placement errors was significantly lower 
compared to the control week, by one millimeter in weeks 2 (cohen's d = 0.686) 
and 3 (cohen's d = 0.780) and by two millimeters in week 4 (cohen's d = 0.875). 
Local dynamic stability of normal walking also improved significantly. More 
precise foot placement may thus have led to improved stability. It remains to be 
determined whether the training effects were the result of walking on LesSchuh 
or from repeated treadmill walking itself. Moreover, enhancement of mechanisms 
beyond the scope of our outcome measures may have improved stability. At the 
retention test, gait stability returned to similar levels as in the control 
week. Yet, a reduction in foot placement error persisted.

INTRODUCTION: Treatment options for adolescent patellofemoral pain (PFP) are 
limited. School footwear might be a suitable intervention to modulate 
patellofemoral joint (PFJ) loads in adolescents with PFP. This study examined 
the immediate effects of a flat, flexible school shoe compared with a 
traditional school shoe on knee joint kinematics and kinetics, and PFJ reaction 
force during walking and running in adolescents with PFP.
METHODS: A total of 28 adolescents (12 female, 16 male; mean ± SD age, 14.3 ± 
1.7 yr) with PFP walked and ran on an instrumented treadmill in two randomly 
ordered conditions: (i) flat, flexible school shoe and (ii) traditional school 
shoe. Three-dimensional marker trajectory and ground reaction force data were 
sampled at 250 and 1000 Hz, respectively. Continuous ankle and knee joint angles 
and moments, PFJ reaction force, and ankle power were compared between 
conditions using one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping paired t -tests 
( α < 0.05).
RESULTS: Walking in the flat, flexible school shoe resulted in a significant 
reduction in knee flexion (15%-35% of gait cycle, P < 0.001), knee extension 
moment (15%-40% of gait cycle, P < 0.001), and PFJ reaction force (15%-40% of 
gait cycle, P < 0.001) compared with the traditional school shoe. During 
running, knee flexion (10%-33% of gait cycle, P < 0.001), knee extension moment 
(15%-25% of gait cycle, P < 0.001), and PFJ reaction force (15%-25% of gait 
cycle, P < 0.001) were lower when wearing the flat, flexible school shoe 
compared with the traditional school shoe.
CONCLUSIONS: PFJ reaction force is reduced when adolescents walk and run in a 
flat, flexible school shoe compared with a traditional school shoe. Flat, 
flexible school shoes may be an effective intervention to modulate biomechanical 
factors related to PFP.

INTRODUCTION: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients with claudication 
symptoms exhibit impaired functional capacity, which has been associated with 
disease severity, worse quality of life and higher risk of cardiovascular 
events. Different tests have been used to assess functional capacity in PAD 
patients. Therefore, understanding the characteristics, strengths and 
limitations of these tests are important to support the choice of tests to be 
used in clinical practice.
AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the main methods to assess functional 
capacity in PAD patients, discussing their psychometric properties, 
applications, and limitations.
EXPERT OPINION: Robust evidence supports the use of treadmill and six-minute 
walk tests in PAD patients, as their results are associated with clinically 
meaningful outcomes, adequate psychometric properties and are sensitive to 
effects of interventions. On the other hand, other functional tests 
(Shuttle-walk test, outdoor walking capacity test, timed-up and go, four-meter 
walk test, heel-rise test, short physical performance battery and modified 
physical performance battery) are related to activities of daily living and do 
not require sophisticated equipment and can be easily used in clinical practice. 
However, these other tests still need evidence regarding their clinical 
relevance, reliability, and ability to detect long-term intervention changes, 
providing further investigation directions.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify how generalized fatigue along 
with hormonal changes throughout the menstrual cycle affects trunk variability 
and local dynamic stability during gait.
METHODS: General fatigue was induced by an incremental test on a treadmill, and 
the menstrual cycle was divided into three phases: follicular, ovulatory, and 
luteal. Twenty-six healthy, young volunteers (aged 18 to 28 years) who did not 
use oral contraceptives or other hormonal drugs with a regular menstrual cycle 
participated in the study. They walked on the treadmill for 4 min at the 
preferred speed, before the incremental test, followed by four sets of 4 min 
alternating between walking, also at preferred speed, and resting. From trunk 
kinematic data, the following were extracted: the mean of the standard deviation 
along strides, as a measure of variability, and the maximum Lyapunov exponent, 
as a measure of local dynamic stability (LDS).
RESULTS: After the incremental test, variability increased, and LDS decreased. 
However, they showed a tendency to return to the initial value faster in women 
compared to previous results for men. In the follicular phase, which has less 
hormonal release, the volunteers had an almost complete recovery in LDS soon 
after the first rest interval, suggesting that female hormones can interfere 
with fatigue recovery. Nevertheless, concerning the LDS, it was significantly 
lower in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase.
CONCLUSION: Women that are not taking oral contraceptives should be aware that 
they are susceptible to increased gait instabilities in the pre-menstrual phase 
after strenuous activities.

INTRODUCTION: Due to altered anatomy of the upper respiratory tract, 
brachycephalic dogs exhibit increased airway resistance and reduced surface area 
for evaporative heat loss, predisposing them to respiratory and thermoregulatory 
problems, a syndrome referred to as Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome 
(BOAS). Compared to non-brachycephalic dogs, brachycephalic breeds are more 
susceptible to heat-related injuries even at low ambient temperatures and 
relatively low physical activity levels. Surgical treatment alleviates clinical 
signs, potentially improving dogs' thermoregulatory ability with BOAS. Our study 
aimed to investigate the thermoregulatory response in French bulldogs before and 
after the surgical correction of BOAS, respectively.
METHODS: Thirteen dogs were exposed to dynamic exercise on a treadmill and the 
dynamics of their rectal temperature (RT) and heart rate (HR) was measured. The 
experiment was performed in two independent sessions, before and after the 
surgical treatment. The test consisted of two consecutive 5-min walks at a speed 
of 2.5 km/h, first at an inclination of 0% and the second at an inclination of 
5%, and a 30-min recovery period. Rectal temperature and HR were measured before 
the start of the test (t0), at the end of the first (t1) and the second part 
(t2), and 15 min (t3) and 30 min (t4) in the recovery.
RESULTS: A significant increase in RT and HR was observed during exercise and 
recovery compared to the resting values, implying that the exercise intensity 
was sufficient to challenge the thermoregulatory response. The increase of RT 
was significantly lower during both parts (t1: p  = 0.004; t2: p  <  0.001) of 
exercise after the surgical treatment than before the treatment. Although a 
trend of lower RT after recovery was observed compared to before the surgery, it 
did not reach statistical significance. Similarly to RT, the HR was 
significantly lower during exercise after the first (p  =  0.020) and the second 
part (p  =  0.011) of exercise after the surgery compared to before the surgery 
but did not reach significance in the recovery.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of BOAS can improve thermoregulation during 
exercise in French bulldogs with BOAS.

INTRODUCTION: Stroke is a neurological deficit caused by an acute focal injury 
to the central nervous system due to vascular injury that can result in loss of 
neurological function, lasting brain damage, long-term disability and, in some 
cases, death. The literature reports that aerobic physical exercise, as well as 
dual-task cognitive walking, are used for the cognitive recovery of people with 
stroke. We aimed to assess whether aerobic physical exercise influences 
post-stroke cognitive recovery, namely performance on selective and sustained 
attention. We tested the hypothesis that post-stroke aerobic physical exercise 
leads to more significant gains than post-stroke dual-task cognitive walking.
METHODS: We used a Randomized Clinical Trial, single-blind, parallel group, to 
verify the existence of differences between two groups. A total of 34 patients 
with subacute to chronic stroke were divided into two groups to train three 
times a week for 12 weeks: the aerobic physical exercise (PE) group engaged in 
20 min on a treadmill, 20 min on a stationary bicycle and 5 min on a desk bike 
pedal exerciser per session; the dual-task (DT) gait exercise group walked for 
45 min while simultaneously performing cognitive tasks per session. All 
participants were assessed on cognitive functioning with the Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) and d2 Test of Attention before acute interventions and post 
interventions. We have also applied a Visual Analog Scale to monitor the 
participants' perceived difficulty, pre-, post-acute, and post-chronic 
interventions. Participants also responded to a Borg Scale of perceived exertion 
following the acute and the final session of chronic training.
RESULTS: A mixed model ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect with a 
large effect size for most of the cognitive variables under study. The variables 
associated with the d2 Test of Attention showed significant differences between 
the groups, mainly from T0 to T2. Also for MMSE, an ANOVA revealed a significant 
interaction effect with significant improvements from T0 to T2. Our results 
strongly suggest that aerobic physical exercise is more beneficial than 
dual-task cognitive-gait exercise since in the PE group, cognitive attention 
scores increase, and cognitive impairment and perception of exertion decrease, 
compared to the DT group.
CONCLUSION: These findings support that PE provides more significant benefits 
for patients post-stroke when compared to DT.

Treadmill walking has been used as a surrogate for overground walking to examine 
how load carriage affects gait. The validity of using treadmill walking to 
investigate load carriage's effects on stability has not been established. 
Thirty young adults were randomized into 3 front-loaded groups (group 1: 0%, 2: 
10%, or 3: 20% of bodyweight). Participants carried their load during overground 
and treadmill walking. Dynamic gait stability (primary outcome) was determined 
for 2 gait events (touchdown and liftoff). Secondary variables included step 
length, gait speed, and trunk angle. Groups 1 and 2 demonstrated similar 
stability between walking surfaces. Group 3 was less stable during treadmill 
walking than overground (P ≤ .005). Besides trunk angle, all secondary outcomes 
were similar between groups (P > .272) but different between surfaces (P ≤ 
.001). The trunk angle at both events showed significant group- and 
surface-related differences (P ≤ .046). Results suggested that walking with an 
anterior load of up to 10% bodyweight causes comparable stability between 
surfaces. A 20% bodyweight front load could render participants less stable on 
the treadmill than overground. This indicates that anteriorly loaded treadmill 
walking may not be interchangeable with overground walking concerning stability 
for anterior loads of 20% bodyweight.

Locomotion results from the interactions of highly nonlinear neural and 
biomechanical dynamics. Accordingly, understanding gait dynamics across 
behavioral conditions and individuals based on detailed modeling of the 
underlying neuromechanical system has proven difficult. Here, we develop a 
data-driven and generative modeling approach that recapitulates the dynamical 
features of gait behaviors to enable more holistic and interpretable 
characterizations and comparisons of gait dynamics. Specifically, gait dynamics 
of multiple individuals are predicted by a dynamical model that defines a 
common, low-dimensional, latent space to compare group and individual 
differences. We find that highly individualized dynamics-i.e., gait 
signatures-for healthy older adults and stroke survivors during treadmill 
walking are conserved across gait speed. Gait signatures further reveal 
individual differences in gait dynamics, even in individuals with similar 
functional deficits. Moreover, components of gait signatures can be 
biomechanically interpreted and manipulated to reveal their relationships to 
observed spatiotemporal joint coordination patterns. Lastly, the gait dynamics 
model can predict the time evolution of joint coordination based on an initial 
static posture. Our gait signatures framework thus provides a generalizable, 
holistic method for characterizing and predicting cyclic, dynamical motor 
behavior that may generalize across species, pathologies, and gait 
perturbations.

Millions of people walk with asymmetric gait patterns, highlighting a need for 
customizable rehabilitation approaches that can flexibly target different 
aspects of gait asymmetry. Here, we studied how simple within-stride changes in 
treadmill speed could drive selective changes in gait symmetry. In Experiment 1, 
healthy adults (n = 10) walked on an instrumented treadmill with and without a 
closed-loop controller engaged. This controller changed the treadmill speed to 
1.50 or 0.75 m/s depending on whether the right or left leg generated propulsive 
ground reaction forces, respectively. Participants walked asymmetrically when 
the controller was engaged: the leg that accelerated during propulsion (right) 
showed smaller leading limb angles, larger trailing limb angles, and smaller 
propulsive forces than the leg that decelerated (left). In Experiment 2, healthy 
adults (n = 10) walked on the treadmill with and without an open-loop controller 
engaged. This controller changed the treadmill speed to 1.50 or 0.75 m/s at a 
prescribed time interval while a metronome guided participants to step at 
different time points relative to the speed change. Different patterns of gait 
asymmetry emerged depending on the timing of the speed change: step times, 
leading limb angles, and peak propulsion were asymmetric when the speed changed 
early in stance while step lengths, step times, and propulsion impulses were 
asymmetric when the speed changed later in stance. In sum, we show that simple 
manipulations of treadmill speed can drive selective changes in gait symmetry. 
Future work will explore the potential for this technique to restore gait 
symmetry in clinical populations.

Aging elicits numerous effects that impact both musculoskeletal structure and 
walking function. Tendon stiffness (kT) and push-off propulsive force (FP) both 
impact the metabolic cost of walking and are diminished by age, yet their 
interaction has not been studied. We combined experimental and computational 
approaches to investigate whether age-related changes in function (adopting 
smaller FP) may be adopted to mitigate the metabolic consequences arising from 
changes in structure (reduced kT). We recruited 12 young adults and asked them 
to walk on a force-sensing treadmill while prompting them to change FP (±20% & 
±40% of typical) using targeted biofeedback. In models driven by experimental 
data from each of those conditions, we altered the kT of personalized 
musculoskeletal models across a physiological range (2-8% strain) and simulated 
individual-muscle metabolic costs for each kT and FP combination. We found that 
kT and FP independently affect walking metabolic cost, increasing with higher kT 
or as participants deviated from their typical FP. Our results show no evidence 
for an interaction between kT and FP in younger adults walking at fixed speeds. 
We also reveal complex individual muscle responses to the kT and FP landscape. 
For example, although total metabolic cost increased by 5% on average with 
combined reductions in kT and FP, the triceps surae muscles experienced a 7% 
local cost reduction on average. Our simulations suggest that reducing FP during 
walking would not mitigate the metabolic consequences of lower kT. Wearable 
devices and rehabilitative strategies can focus on either kT or FP to reduce 
age-related increases in walking metabolic cost.

An in-depth understanding of the mechanism of lower extremity muscle 
coordination during walking is the key to improving the efficacy of gait 
rehabilitation in patients with neuromuscular dysfunction. This paper 
investigates the effect of changes in walking speed on lower extremity muscle 
synergy patterns and muscle functional networks. Eight healthy subjects were 
recruited to perform walking tasks on a treadmill at three different speeds, and 
the surface electromyographic signals (sEMG) of eight muscles of the right lower 
limb were collected synchronously. The non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) 
method was used to extract muscle synergy patterns, the mutual information (MI) 
method was used to construct the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz), beta frequency 
band (14-30 Hz) and gamma frequency band (31-60 Hz) muscle functional network, 
and complex network analysis methods were introduced to quantify the differences 
between different networks. Muscle synergy analysis extracted 5 muscle synergy 
patterns, and changes in walking speed did not change the number of muscle 
synergy, but resulted in changes in muscle weights. Muscle network analysis 
found that at the same speed, high-frequency bands have lower global efficiency 
and clustering coefficients. As walking speed increased, the strength of 
connections between local muscles also increased. The results show that there 
are different muscle synergy patterns and muscle function networks in different 
walking speeds. This study provides a new perspective for exploring the 
mechanism of muscle coordination at different walking speeds, and is expected to 
provide theoretical support for the evaluation of gait function in patients with 
neuromuscular dysfunction.

深入了解步行过程中的下肢肌肉协作机制是提高神经肌肉功能障碍患者步态康复疗效的关键。本文研究了步行速度的变化对下肢肌肉协同模式及肌肉功能网络的影响。招募了8名健康受试者分别以三种不同速度在跑步机上执行步行任务，同步采集右下肢8块肌肉的表面肌电信号（sEMG），通过非负矩阵分解（NNMF）方法提取肌肉协同模式，利用互信息（MI）方法分别构建alpha频段（8～13 
Hz）、beta频段（14～30 Hz）和gamma频段（31～60 
Hz）肌肉功能网络，引入复杂网络分析方法量化不同网络差异。肌肉协同分析提取到5个肌肉协同模式，步行速度的变化没有改变肌肉协同的数量，但导致了肌肉权值的变化；肌肉网络分析发现在同一速度下，高频段具有更低的全局效率和聚类系数，随着步行速度的增加，局部肌肉之间的连接强度增加。研究结果表明不同速度的步行运动存在不同的肌肉协同模式和肌肉功能网络，本研究为探索不同步行速度下肌肉协同机制提供了新的视野，有望为神经肌肉功能障碍患者的步态功能评估提供理论支撑。.

Wearable exoskeletons show significant potential for improving gait impairments, 
such as interlimb asymmetry. However, a more profound understanding of whether 
exoskeletons are capable of eliciting neural adaptation is needed. This study 
aimed to characterize how individuals adapt to bilateral asymmetric joint 
stiffness applied by a hip exoskeleton, similar to split-belt treadmill 
training. Thirteen unimpaired individuals performed a walking trial on the 
treadmill while wearing the exoskeleton. The right side of the exoskeleton acted 
as a positive stiffness torsional spring, pulling the thigh towards the neutral 
standing position, while the left acted as a negative stiffness spring pulling 
the thigh away from the neutral standing position. The results showed that this 
intervention applied by a hip exoskeleton elicited adaptation in spatiotemporal 
and kinetic gait measures similar to split-belt treadmill training. These 
results demonstrate the potential of the proposed intervention for retraining 
symmetric gait.

Treadmill-based gait rehabilitation protocols have shown that real-time visual 
biofeedback can promote learning of improved gait biomechanics, but previous 
feedback work has largely involved treadmill walking and not overground gait. 
The objective of this study was to determine the short-term response to hip 
extension visual biofeedback, with individuals post-stroke, during unconstrained 
overground walking. Individuals post-stroke typically have a decreased paretic 
propulsion and walking speed, but increasing hip extension angle may enable the 
paretic leg to better translate force anteriorly during push-off. Fourteen 
individuals post-stroke completed overground walking, one 6-min control bout 
without feedback, and three 6-min training bouts with real-time feedback. Data 
were recorded before and after the control bout, before and after the first 
training bout, and after the third training bout to assess the effects of 
training. Visual biofeedback consisted of a display attached to eyeglasses that 
showed one horizontal bar indicating the user's current hip angle and another 
symbolizing the target hip extension to be reached during training. On average, 
paretic hip extension angle (p = 0.014), trailing limb angle (p = 0.025), and 
propulsion (p = 0.011) were significantly higher after training. Walking speed 
increased but was not significantly higher after training (p = 0.089). 
Individuals demonstrated a greater increase in their hip extension angle 
(p = 0.035) and propulsion (p = 0.030) after the walking bout with feedback 
compared to the control bout, but changes in walking speed did not significantly 
differ (p = 0.583) between a control walking bout and a feedback bout. Our 
results show the feasibility of overground visual gait feedback and suggest that 
feedback regarding paretic hip extension angle enabled many individuals 
post-stroke to improve parameters important for their walking function.

BACKGROUND: In peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients with intermittent 
claudication (IC), the combination of aerobic and resistance exercises could 
counteract muscle loss and attenuate disease progression. This study analyzed 
the effects of six months of a combined exercise program on walking ability, 
lower limb body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, and Ankle-Brachial 
Index (ABI).
METHODS: Twenty-three patients (age 63.2±1.5 years and ABI 0.58±0.07) with PAD 
and IC were allocated to a control group (CG) or a supervised exercise group 
(SUP). Ten patients underwent six months of treadmill walking combined with 
resistance exercises, three times a week. The CG (N.=13) received a 
recommendation for walking. All patients were measured at baseline (M0), after 
three months (M3), and six months (M6).
RESULTS: During constant treadmill protocol, the claudication onset 
time/distance (COT/COD), absolute claudication time/distance (ACT/ACD), and 
number of pauses of overall patients significantly improved at M3 and M6. 
Between groups were found significant differences in COT and COD at M6 (P=0.005 
and P=0.007, respectively); and in ACT and ACD at M3 (P=0.003 for both) and at 
M6 (P=0.005 and P=0.005, respectively), with major improvements in the SUP. Over 
the six months, a significant group effect was found in fat-free mass (P=0.041) 
and predicted muscle mass (P=0.039) of the lower ABI leg, with greater 
improvements in the SUP.
CONCLUSIONS: A supervised exercise program that combines aerobic and resistance 
training improves PAD symptoms and has additional benefits for patients. 
Patients in the program showed improvements in walking ability, lower-limb body 
composition, perceived exertion, and heart rate during treadmill walking.

The underwater treadmill (UWTM) is utilized in dogs recovering from 
thoracolumbar intervertebral disc extrusion (TL-IVDE). Gait scoring is validated 
for dogs with TL-IVDE walking on the land treadmill (LT) but has not been 
reported for the UWTM. Our objective was to investigate if LT gait analysis 
could be applied to the UWTM and if non-ambulatory dogs walking unassisted on 
the UWTM, at a standardized water level, would be more likely to generate gait 
scores compared to on the LT. This was a prospective, observational study in 
dogs with TL-IVDE managed surigcally. At 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks 
post-operatively, paired video footage of dogs walking on the LT and UWTM (water 
level at the greater trochanter) was used to generate 0-100 stepping (SS) and 
coordination (regularity index, RI) scores. Scores were compared between 
treadmill type and over time. Twenty dogs were enrolled and seventy-eight paired 
recordings were available for review. Median gait scores increased over time but 
did not differ by treadmill type (P = 0.262 for SS, P = 0.533 for RI). Combining 
SS and RI, more recordings received scores of 0 for the LT (n = 58/156; 37.2 %) 
compared to the UWTM (n = 44/156; 28.2 %; P = 0.043). Scores of 0, at visits 
when there was at least movement present at multiple joints, was more common on 
the LT (n = 11/108; 10.2 %) compared to the UWTM (n = 2/108, 1.9 %; P = 0.026). 
In dogs recovering from TL-IVDE, LT-based gait scoring was feasible in dogs 
walking on the UWTM and might complement other gait analysis methods, especially 
for non-ambulatory dogs.

BACKGROUND: Hearing loss predicts cognitive decline and falls risk. It has been 
argued that degraded hearing makes listening effortful, causing competition for 
higher-level cognitive resources needed for secondary cognitive or motor tasks. 
Therefore, executive function training has the potential to improve cognitive 
performance, in turn improving mobility, especially when older adults with 
hearing loss are engaged in effortful listening. Moreover, research using mobile 
neuroimaging and ecologically valid measures of cognition and mobility in this 
population is limited. The objective of this research is to examine the effect 
of at-home cognitive training on dual-task performance using laboratory and 
simulated real-world conditions in normal-hearing adults and older hearing aid 
users. We hypothesize that executive function training will lead to greater 
improvements in cognitive-motor dual-task performance compared to a wait-list 
control group. We also hypothesize that executive function training will lead to 
the largest dual-task improvements in older hearing aid users, followed by 
normal-hearing older adults, and then middle-aged adults.
METHODS: A multi-site (Concordia University and KITE-Toronto Rehabilitation 
Institute, University Health Network) single-blinded randomized controlled trial 
will be conducted whereby participants are randomized to either 12 weeks of 
at-home computerized executive function training or a wait-list control. 
Participants will consist of normal-hearing middle-aged adults (45-60 years old) 
and older adults (65-80 years old), as well as older hearing aid users 
(65-80 years old, ≥ 6 months hearing aid experience). Separate samples will 
undergo the same training protocol and the same pre- and post-evaluations of 
cognition, hearing, and mobility across sites. The primary dual-task outcome 
measures will involve either static balance (KITE site) or treadmill walking 
(Concordia site) with a secondary auditory-cognitive task. Dual-task performance 
will be assessed in an immersive virtual reality environment in KITE's StreetLab 
and brain activity will be measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy 
at Concordia's PERFORM Centre.
DISCUSSION: This research will establish the efficacy of an at-home cognitive 
training program on complex auditory and motor functioning under laboratory and 
simulated real-world conditions. This will contribute to rehabilitation 
strategies in order to mitigate or prevent physical and cognitive decline in 
older adults with hearing loss.

OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the effect of gait training using a walking-assist robot 
that assists a subject's knee joint movement and leg swing to achieve toe 
clearance of the paralyzed-side lower limb during treadmill walking.
METHODS: The subjects were 10 hemiplegic stroke patients in a rehabilitation 
ward. The intervention consisted of gait training using the Welwalk WW-1000 
(Welwalk) robot for 40 min. Immediately before and after this intervention, a 
gait analysis of the patients' treadmill walking was performed by a 
three-dimensional motion capture system. Statistical analyses compared the 
foot-to-floor distance and the shortening of hip-toe length (SHTL) of the 
paralyzed side before and after the intervention, and examined the relationship 
between the change of lower-limb joint kinematics and toe clearance before and 
after the intervention.
RESULTS: The post-intervention SHTL was significantly lower compared to before 
the intervention, and there was a significant negative correlation between the 
change in the SHTL and the knee flexion angle from before to after the 
intervention.
CONCLUSION: Gait exercise using the Welwalk could contribute to the acquisition 
of more normal leg-swing strategies.

Objective. Gait assessments have traditionally been analysed in laboratory 
settings, but this may not reflect natural gait. Wearable technology may offer 
an alternative due to its versatility. The purpose of the study was to establish 
the validity and reliability of temporal gait outcomes calculated by the DANU 
sports system, against a 3D motion capture reference system.Approach. Forty-one 
healthy adults (26 M, 15 F, age 36.4 ± 11.8 years) completed a series of 
overground walking and jogging trials and 60 s treadmill walking and running 
trials at various speeds (8-14 km hr-1), participants returned for a second 
testing session to repeat the same testing.Main results. For validity, 1406 
steps and 613 trials during overground and across all treadmill trials were 
analysed respectively. Temporal outcomes generated by the DANU sports system 
included ground contact time, swing time and stride time all demonstrated 
excellent agreement compared to the laboratory reference (intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC) > 0.900), aside from ground contact time during overground 
jogging which had good agreement (ICC = 0.778). For reliability, 666 overground 
and 511 treadmill trials across all speeds were examined. Test re-test agreement 
was excellent for all outcomes across treadmill trials (ICC > 0.900), except for 
swing time during treadmill walking which had good agreement (ICC = 0.886). 
Overground trials demonstrated moderate to good test re-test agreement (ICC = 
0.672-0.750), which may be due to inherent variability of self-selected (rather 
than treadmill set) pacing between sessions.Significance. Overall, this study 
showed that temporal gait outcomes from the DANU Sports System had good to 
excellent validity and moderate to excellent reliability in healthy adults 
compared to an established laboratory reference.

To more closely mimic overground walking, researchers are developing adaptive 
treadmills (ATMs) that update belt speed in real-time based on user gait 
mechanics. Many existing ATM control schemes are solely based on position on the 
belt and do not respond to changes in gait mechanics, like propulsive forces, 
that result in increased overground walking speed. To target natural causal 
mechanisms to alter speed, we developed an ATM controller that adjusts speed via 
changes in position, step length, and propulsion. Gains on each input dictate 
the impact of the corresponding parameter on belt speed. The study objective was 
to determine the effect of modifying the position gain on self-selected walking 
speed, measures of propulsion, and step length. Twenty-two participants walked 
at their self-selected speed with four ATM controllers, each with a unique 
position gain. Walking speed, anterior and posterior ground reaction force peaks 
and impulses, net impulse, and step length were compared between conditions. 
Smaller position gains promoted more equivalent anterior and posterior impulses, 
resulting in a net impulse closer to zero (p = 0.0043), a characteristic of 
healthy gait. Walking speed, anterior and posterior ground reaction force peaks 
and impulses, and step length did not change between conditions (all p > 0.05). 
These results suggest that reducing the importance of position in the ATM 
controller may promote more balanced anterior and posterior impulses, possibly 
improving the efficacy of the ATM for gait rehabilitation by emphasizing changes 
in gait mechanics instead of position to naturally adjust speed.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to develop a standardized 
contrast-enhanced duplex ultrasound (CE-DUS) protocol to assess lower-extremity 
muscle perfusion before and after exercise and determine relationships of 
perfusion with clinical and functional measures.
METHODS: CE-DUS (EPIQ 5G, Philips) was used before and immediately after a 
10-minute, standardized bout of treadmill walking to compare microvascular 
perfusion of the gastrocnemius muscle in older (55-82 years) patients with 
peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (n = 15, mean ankle-brachial index, 0.78 ± 
0.04) and controls (n = 13). Microvascular blood volume (MBV) and microvascular 
flow velocity (MFV) were measured at rest and immediately following treadmill 
exercise, and the Modified Physical Performance Test (MPPT) was used to assess 
mobility function.
RESULTS: In the resting state (pre-exercise), MBV in patients with PAD was not 
significantly different than normal controls (5.17 ± 0.71 vs 6.20 ± 0.83 
arbitrary units (AU) respectively; P = .36); however, after exercise, MBV was 
∼40% lower in patients with PAD compared with normal controls (5.85 ± 1.13 vs 
9.53 ± 1.31 AU, respectively; P = .04). Conversely, MFV was ∼60% higher in 
patients with PAD compared with normal controls after exercise (0.180 ± 0.016 vs 
0.113 ± 0.018 AU, respectively; P = .01). There was a significant between-group 
difference in the exercise-induced changes in both MBV and MFV (P ≤ .05). Both 
basal and exercise MBV directly correlated with MPPT score in the patients with 
PAD (r = 0.56-0.62; P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: This standardized protocol for exercise stress testing of the lower 
extremities quantifies calf muscle perfusion and elicits perfusion deficits in 
patients with PAD. This technique objectively quantifies microvascular perfusion 
deficits that are related to reduced mobility function and could be used to 
assess therapeutic efficacy in patients with PAD.

BACKGROUND: Muscular strength is an important component of physical fitness. We 
evaluated the relationship between baseline muscular strength and risk of stroke 
among adults who were aged ≥65 years during follow-up.
METHODS: We included 7627 healthy adults (mean age = 43.9 years, 86.0% male) 
underwent a baseline physical examination between 1980 and 1989. Muscular 
strength was determined by 1-repetition maximum measures for bench press and leg 
press and categorized into age- and sex-specific tertiles for each measure. 
Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) was assessed via a maximal treadmill exercise 
test. Those enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare from 1999 to 2019 were included 
in the analyses. Associations between baseline strength and stroke outcomes were 
estimated using a modified Cox proportional hazards model. In a secondary 
analysis, we examined stroke risk by categories of CRF where Quintile 1 = low, 
Quintiles 2-3 = moderate, and Quintiles 4-5 = high CRF based on age and sex.
RESULTS: After 70,072 person-years of Medicare follow-up, there were 1211 
earliest indications of incident stroke. In multivariable analyses, the hazard 
ratio (95% confidence interval (95%CI)) for stroke across bench press categories 
were 1.0 (referent), 0.96 (0.83-1.11), and 0.89 (0.77-1.04), respectively (p 
trend = 0.14). The trend across categories of leg press was also non-significant 
(p trend = 0.79). Adjusted hazard ratio (95%CI) for stroke across ordered CRF 
categories were 1.0 (referent), 0.90 (0.71-1.13), and 0.72 (0.57-0.92) (p trend 
< 0.01).
CONCLUSION: While meeting public health guidelines for muscular strengthening 
activities is likely to improve muscular strength as well as many health 
outcomes in older adults, performing such activities may not be helpful in 
preventing stroke. Conversely, meeting guidelines for aerobic activity is likely 
to improve CRF and lower stroke risk.

BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia guidelines indicate that exercise is critical in the 
management of fibromyalgia, and there is evidence that patients with 
fibromyalgia can perform resistance training at moderate and high intensities. 
However, despite the biological plausibility that progression of intensity 
provides greater benefit to individuals, no studies have compared different 
intensities (progressive versus constant intensities) of the same exercise in 
this population.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of 24 sessions of resistance training 
(progressive vs. constant intensity) on impact of fibromyalgia, sleep quality, 
anxiety, depression, pain, walking ability, and musculoskeletal capacity.
METHODS: A protocol for a blinded randomized controlled trial. The sample will 
be randomized into three groups: group 1 (progressive intensity, experimental), 
group 2 (constant intensity, control A), and group 3 (walking, control B). Group 
1 will perform resistance training at moderate intensity (50% of maximum dynamic 
strength), previously determined by the 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) test in the 
proposed exercises. The strength of each individual will be reassessed every 4 
weeks (by 1-RM) and the intensity of each exercise will be positively adjusted 
by 20% of the value observed in kg (i.e., first month 50%; second month 70%; 
third month 90% of the maximum dynamic strength). Group 2 will perform the same 
procedure, but the intensity will be maintained at 50% of the maximum dynamic 
strength throughout the treatment (i.e., constant intensity from the first to 
the third month). Group 3 will perform a 40-minute treadmill walk at low 
intensity, defined by a walking speed corresponding to 60-70% of the maximum 
heart rate, which we will control with a heart rate monitor. All groups will 
receive a 45-minute pain education session prior to the exercise program, 
covering the pathophysiologic mechanisms of chronic pain, strategies for coping 
with pain, avoiding hypervigilance, and deconstructing beliefs and myths about 
chronic pain.
DISCUSSION: The results of the present study may help health care professionals 
adjust the intensity of resistance training and thus plan the most effective 
intervention (progressive or constant intensity) to reduce the impact of 
fibromyalgia on patients' lives.

The ankle dynamic joint stiffness (DJS), defined as the slope of the joint 
angle-moment plot, measures the resistance of the ankle joint to movement when 
the foot is in contact with the ground. DJS helps to stabilize the ankle joint, 
and its characterization helps to identify gait pathology and assist foot 
prosthesis design. This study analyzes the available gait dynamics data to 
obtain ankle DJS parameters for population groups according to age, gender, and 
gait speed for overground and treadmill walking. This study classified the 
groups into five walking speeds normalized using the Froude number. Herein, 12 
ankle DJS parameters were determined. These include four linear segments: 
controlled plantar flexion (CP), early response phase (ERP), large response 
phase (LRP), and descending phase (DP), their corresponding turning points, the 
net mechanical work, the absorbed work, and the loop direction. Ankle dynamics 
data for 92 individuals was collected from two gait data repositories. The 
analysis reveals a notable disparity in stiffness values between overground and 
treadmill gait. Specifically, the CP stiffness is significantly higher for 
overground gait. In contrast, the DP stiffness displays an opposing pattern, 
with higher values observed during treadmill walking. A negative stiffness for 
LRP was found at fast speeds for all groups. The sorted data, analysis tools, 
and findings of this study are meant to help practitioners design prosthetic and 
rehabilitation devices based on age, gender, and walking environment at 
different gait speeds.

Machine learning-based gait systems facilitate the real-time control of gait 
assistive technologies in neurological conditions. Improving such systems needs 
the identification of kinematic signals from inertial measurement unit wearables 
(IMUs) that are robust across different walking conditions without extensive 
data processing. We quantify changes in two kinematic signals, acceleration and 
angular velocity, from IMUs worn on the frontal plane of bilateral shanks and 
thighs in 30 adolescents (8-18 years) on a treadmills and outdoor overground 
walking at three different speeds (self-selected, slow, and fast). Primary 
curve-based analyses included similarity analyses such as cosine, Euclidean 
distance, Poincare analysis, and a newly defined bilateral symmetry 
dissimilarity test (BSDT). Analysis indicated that superior-inferior shank 
acceleration (SI shank Acc) and medial-lateral shank angular velocity (ML shank 
AV) demonstrated no differences to the control signal in BSDT, indicating the 
least variability across the different walking conditions. Both SI shank Acc and 
ML shank AV were also robust in Poincare analysis. Secondary parameter-based 
similarity analyses with conventional spatiotemporal gait parameters were also 
performed. This normative dataset of walking reports raw signal kinematics that 
demonstrate the least to most variability in switching between treadmill and 
outdoor walking to help guide future machine learning models to assist gait in 
pediatric neurological conditions.

Wireless wearable insoles are interesting tools to collect gait parameters 
during daily life activities. However, studies have to be performed specifically 
for each type of insoles on a big data set to validate the measurement in 
ecological situations. This study aims to assess the criterion validity and 
test-retest reliability of gait parameters from wearable insoles compared to 
motion capture system. Gait of 30 healthy participants was recorded using DSPro® 
insoles and a motion capture system during overground and treadmill walking at 
three different speeds. Criterion validity and test-retest reliability of 
spatio-temporal parameters were estimated with an intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC). For both systems, reliability was found higher than 0.70 for 
all variables (p < 0.001) except for minimum toe clearance (ICC < 0.50) with 
motion capture system during overground walking. Regardless of speed and 
condition of walking, Speed, Cadence, Stride Length, Stride Time and Stance Time 
variables were validated (ICC > 0.90; p < 0.001). During walking on treadmill, 
loading time was not validated during slow speed (ICC < 0.70). This study 
highlights good criterion validity and test-retest reliability of spatiotemporal 
gait parameters measurement using wearable insoles and opens a new possibility 
to improve care management of patients using clinical gait analysis in daily 
life activities.

The most recent WHO recommendations about physical activity emphasise the 
importance of total exercise volume above the significance of the duration of 
each bout. This study examined whether acute aerobic exercise changes 
circulating levels of IL-8 and MCP-1 and if these changes are associated with 
body composition and energy metabolism. Healthy adult volunteers completed a 10 
min walking-running exercise on a treadmill. Indirect calorimetry was used to 
determine their resting metabolic rate (RMR) and energy expenditure (EE) during 
the exercise. Pre-exercise levels of IL-8 and MCP-1 were similar in both sexes. 
There were positive correlations of pre-exercise IL-8 with body mass, waist 
circumference, and lean body mass in men and pre-exercise MCP-1 with RMR in 
women. The exercise led to an increase in IL-8 of 68% and a decrease in MCP-1 of 
74% of participants. An increase in post-exercise IL-8 in men was associated 
with greater walking EE and a greater increase in walking EE. The increase in 
post-exercise MCP-1 was associated with a lower RMR and running EE in women. 
There are both sex and individual variations in changes in chemokine secretion 
in response to the same exercise situation and their associations with values of 
metabolic parameters.

BACKGROUND: Despite advances in medical and cardiac resynchronization therapy 
(CRT), individuals with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) have persistent 
symptoms, including exercise intolerance. Optimizing cardio-locomotor coupling 
may increase stroke volume and skeletal muscle perfusion as previously shown in 
healthy runners. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that exercise stroke volume 
and cardiac output would be higher during fixed-paced walking when steps were 
synchronized with the diastolic compared with systolic portion of the cardiac 
cycle in patients with CHF and CRT.
METHODS: Ten participants (58±17 years of age; 40% female) with CHF and 
previously implanted CRT pacemakers completed 5-minute bouts of walking on a 
treadmill (range, 1.5-3 mph). Participants were randomly assigned to first 
walking to an auditory tone to synchronize their foot strike to either the 
systolic (0% or 100±15% of the R-R interval) or diastolic phase (45±15% of the 
R-R interval) of their cardiac cycle and underwent assessments of oxygen uptake 
(V̇o2; indirect calorimetry) and cardiac output (acetylene rebreathing). Data 
were compared through paired-samples t tests.
RESULTS: V̇o2 was similar between conditions (diastolic 1.02±0.44 versus 
systolic 1.05±0.42 L/min; P=0.299). Compared with systolic walking, stroke 
volume (diastolic 80±28 versus systolic 74±26 mL; P=0.003) and cardiac output 
(8.3±3.5 versus 7.9±3.4 L/min; P=0.004) were higher during diastolic walking; 
heart rate (paced) was not different between conditions. Mean arterial pressure 
was significantly lower during diastolic walking (85±12 versus 98±20 mm Hg; 
P=0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CHF who have received CRT, diastolic stepping 
increases stroke volume and oxygen delivery and decreases afterload. We 
speculate that, if added to pacemakers, this cardio-locomotor coupling 
technology may maximize CRT efficiency and increase exercise participation and 
quality of life in patients with CHF.

BACKGROUND: As people age there is a proximal shift of joint moment generation 
from ankle plantarflexion and knee extension toward hip extension and flexion 
moments. This age-related redistribution has been documented in the context of 
propulsive force generation during the push-off phase with less evidence in the 
context of weight bearing. Additionally, these sagittal plane joint moments have 
been a primary focus of studies though the hip frontal plane moment also 
contributes to vertical support but has received less attention. Furthermore, 
how aging affects the relationships between changes in sagittal and frontal 
joint moments and changes in vertical support force as a function of walking 
speed remains unclear RESEARCH QUESTION: How does aging affect the contributions 
of sagittal and frontal plane joint moments to weight-bearing across different 
walking speeds?
METHODS: Gait analysis was performed on 24 young and 17 healthy older subjects 
walked on the treadmill at their preferred and 30 % faster speeds. Stepwise 
linear regression analysis was performed to determine the joint moments that 
predict the peak amplitudes of the vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) across 
different walking speeds.
RESULTS: Hip abduction and knee extension moments were the primary contributors 
to leading limb weight-bearing in young, whereas hip extension moment was the 
primary contributor in older adults. Ankle plantarflexion moment was the main 
contributor to trailing limb weight-bearing in young and hip flexion moment was 
the main contributor in older adults. From preferred to faster walking speed 
changes in knee extension moment were the primary contributor to changes in the 
trailing limb weight-bearing in young whereas changes in hip extension moment 
were the primary contributor in olderadults.
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggested that older and younger adults used 
different joint moment contributions to produce leading limb and trailing limb 
vertical support forces across different walking speeds.

Modular armour allows soldiers to adjust the level of coverage according to the 
threat level. We hypothesized that armour configurations with lower levels of 
torso soft armour coverage attenuate physiological and perceptual responses 
during exercise in the heat. Fifteen adults (5 females/10 males, 26 ± 5 years) 
walked (5 km/h, 1% incline, 1h) in dry heat (38 °C, 20% humidity) while wearing 
body armour that provided; i) high coverage (HC: 0.57 ± 0.09 m2, 18.5 ± 0.3 kg), 
ii) moderate coverage (MC: 0.44 ± 0.07 m2, 18.1 ± 0.3 kg), iii) low coverage 
(LC1: 0.21 ± 0.03 m2, 17.4 ± 0.1 kg), or iv) low coverage with weight 
equalization (LC2: 0.21 ± 0.03 m2, 18.6 ± 0.2 kg). Core temperature (Tcore), 
heart rate (HR), metabolic heat production (M-W), whole-body sweat rate (WBSR), 
and perceptual responses were measured. M-W during exercise (629 ± 126 W) did 
not differ between configurations (p = 0.30). The change in Tcore (HC: 
0.88 ± 0.37 °C, MC: 0.85 ± 0.32 °C, LC1: 0.91 ± 0.38 °C, LC2: 0.89 ± 0.42 °C, 
p = 0.93), HR (HC: 97 ± 14 bpm, MC: 103 ± 16 bpm, LC1: 96 ± 15 bpm, LC2: 97 ± 20 
bpm, p = 0.08), and WBSR (HC: 10.2 ± 3.4 g/min, MC: 10.3 ± 4.3 g/min, LC1: 
9.9 ± 4.7 g/min, LC2: 10.4 ± 4.5 g/min, p = 0.84) did not differ between 
configurations. Perceptual responses did not differ between configurations (all 
p ≥ 0.15). Reducing torso soft armour coverage, with minimal reductions in 
armour load, does not reduce physiological or perceptual strain during walking 
in dry heat.

Deep Learning for Multiple Sclerosis Differentiation Using Multi-Stride Dynamics 
in Gait.

Kaur R, Levy J, Motl RW, Sowers R, Hernandez ME.

OBJECTIVE: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition of the 
central nervous system leading to various physical, mental and psychiatric 
complexities. Mobility limitations are amongst the most frequent and early 
markers of MS. We evaluated the effectiveness of a DeepMS2G (deep learning (DL) 
for MS differentiation using multistride dynamics in gait) framework, which is a 
DL-based methodology to classify multi-stride sequences of persons with MS 
(PwMS) from healthy controls (HC), in order to generalize over newer walking 
tasks and subjects.
METHODS: We collected single-task Walking and dual-task Walking-while-Talking 
gait data using an instrumented treadmill from a balanced collection of 20 HC 
and 20 PwMS. We utilized domain knowledge-based spatiotemporal and kinetic gait 
features along with two normalization schemes, namely standard size-based and 
multiple regression normalization strategies. To differentiate between 
multi-stride sequences of HC and PwMS, we compared 16 traditional machine 
learning and DL algorithms. Further, we studied the interpretability of our 
highest-performing models; and discussed the association between the lower 
extremity function of participants and our model predictions.
RESULTS: We observed that residual neural network (ResNet) based models with 
regression-based normalization were the top performers across both task and 
subject generalization classification designs. Considering regression-based 
normalization, a multi-scale ResNet attained a subject classification accuracy 
and F 1-score of 1.0 when generalizing from single-task Walking to dual-task 
Walking-while-Talking; and a ResNet resulted in the top subject-wise accuracy 
and F 1 of 0.83 and 0.81 (resp.), when generalizing over unseen participants.
CONCLUSION: We used advanced DL and dynamics across domain knowledge-based 
spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters to successfully classify MS gait 
across distinct walking trials and unseen participants.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our proposed DL algorithms might contribute to efforts to automate 
MS diagnoses.

Heart failure (HF) patients traditionally report dyspnoea as their main symptom. 
Although the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and 6 min walking test are the 
standardized tools in assessing functional capacity, neither cycle ergometers 
nor treadmill maximal efforts do fully represent the actual HF patients' 
everyday activities [activities of daily living (ADLs)] (i.e. climbing the 
stairs). New-generation portable metabolimeters allow the clinician to measure 
task-related oxygen intake (VO2) in different scenarios and exercise protocols. 
In the last years, we have made considerable progress in understanding the 
ventilatory and metabolic behaviours of HF patients and healthy subjects during 
tasks aimed to reproduce ADLs. In this paper, we describe the most recent 
findings in the field, with special attention to the relationship between the 
metabolic variables obtained during ADLs and CPET parameters (i.e. peak VO2), 
demonstrating, for example, how exercises traditionally thought to be 
undemanding, such as a walk, instead represent supramaximal efforts, 
particularly for subjects with advanced HF and/or artificial heart (left 
ventricular assist devices) wearers.

Plain Language Summary: This article summarizes the most recent evidence on the 
cardiometabolic behaviours of a full spectrum of heart failure (HF) patients of 
different severity during their daily life activities (i.e. walking, making a 
bed, and taking the stairs).Heart failure patients experience symptoms (mostly 
dyspnoea) during daily activities that sometimes represent maximal or 
supramaximal exercises for them, particularly for the most severe 
patients.Measuring metabolic parameters (O2 intake, ventilation, and CO2 
production) through appropriate devices during these activities provides a 
better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HF 
patients’ symptoms and their adaptation. This can lead to the detection of new 
parameters that can become novel patient-centred prognostic markers or 
therapeutic targets for drugs and rehabilitation treatments.

BACKGROUND: Accidental falls are a major health issue in older people. One 
significant and potentially modifiable risk factor is reduced gait stability. 
Clinicians do not have sophisticated kinematic options to measure this risk 
factor with simple and affordable systems. Depth-imaging with AI-pose estimation 
can be used for gait analysis in young healthy adults. However, is it applicable 
for measuring gait in older adults at a risk of falling?
METHODS: In this methodological comparison 59 older adults with and without a 
history of falls walked on a treadmill while their gait pattern was recorded 
with multiple inertial measurement units and with an Azure Kinect depth-camera. 
Spatiotemporal gait parameters of both systems were compared for convergent 
validity and with a Bland-Altman plot.
RESULTS: Correlation between systems for stride length (r=.992, [Formula: see 
text]) and stride time (r=0.914, [Formula: see text]) was high. Bland-Altman 
plots revealed a moderate agreement in stride length (-0.74 ± 3.68 cm; [-7.96 cm 
to 6.47 cm]) and stride time (-3.7±54 ms; [-109 ms to 102 ms]).
CONCLUSION: Gait parameters in older adults with and without a history of falls 
can be measured with inertial measurement units and Azure Kinect cameras. 
Affordable and small depth-cameras agree with IMUs for gait analysis in older 
adults with and without an increased risk of falling. However, tolerable 
accuracy is limited to the average over multiple steps of spatiotemporal 
parameters derived from the initial foot contact. Clinical Translation 
Statement- Gait parameters in older adults with and without a history of falls 
can be measured with inertial measurement units and Azure Kinect. Affordable and 
small depth-cameras, developed for various purposes in research and industry, 
agree with IMUs in clinical gait analysis in older adults with and without an 
increased risk of falling. However, tolerable accuracy to assess function or 
monitor changes in gait is limited to the average over multiple steps of 
spatiotemporal parameters derived from the initial foot contact.

PURPOSE: This study investigated the effects of a 12-week gait retraining 
program on the morphological and mechanical properties of the Achilles tendon 
(AT) during running on the basis of real-time dynamic ultrasound imaging.
METHODS: A total of 30 male recreational runners who were used to wearing 
cushioned shoes with a rearfoot strike (RFS) pattern were recruited. They were 
randomized into a retraining group (RG, n = 15) and a control group (CG, 
n = 15). The RG group was asked to run in five-fingered minimalist shoes with a 
forefoot strike (FFS) pattern, and the CG group was asked to keep their strike 
pattern. Three training sessions were performed per week. All the participants 
in RG uploaded running tracks obtained through a mobile application (.jpg) after 
each session for training supervision. The ground reaction force, kinematics, 
and kinetics of the ankle joint at 10 km/h were collected using an instrumented 
split-belt treadmill and a motion capture system. The morphological (length and 
cross-sectional area) and mechanical characteristics (force, stress, strain, 
etc.) of AT in vivo were recorded and calculated with a synchronous ultrasonic 
imaging instrument before and after the intervention. Repeated two-way ANOVA was 
used to compare the aforementioned parameters.
RESULTS: A total of 28 participants completed the training. The strike angle of 
RG after training was significantly smaller than that before training and 
significantly smaller than that of CG after training (F (1, 13)  = 23.068, 
p < 0.001, partial η2  = 0.640). The length (F (1, 13)  = 10.086, p = 0.007, 
partial η2  = 0.437) and CSA (F (1, 13)  = 7.475, p = 0.017, partial η2 
 = 0.365) of AT in RG increased after training. A significant main effect for 
time was observed for the time-to-peak AT force (F (1, 13)  = 5.225, p = 0.040, 
partial η2  = 0.287), average (F (1, 13)  = 7.228, p = 0.019, partial η2 
 = 0.357), and peak AT loading rate (F (1, 13)  = 11.687, p = 0.005, partial η2 
 = 0.473).
CONCLUSION: Preliminary evidence indicated that a 12-week gait retraining 
program could exert a beneficial effect on AT. 57% (8/14) runners in RG shifted 
from RFS to FFS pattern. Although not all runners were categorized as FFS 
pattern after the intervention, their foot strike angle was reduced. Retraining 
primarily positively promoted AT morphological properties (i.e., CSA and length) 
to strengthen AT capability for mechanical loading.

BACKGROUND: Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) measured by peak oxygen consumption 
(VO2peak) declines with aging and correlates with mortality and morbidity. 
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) has long been the criterion method to 
assess CRF, but its feasibility, efficacy and reliability in older adults is 
unclear. The large, multicenter Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) 
employed CPET to evaluate the mechanisms underlying declines in mobility with 
aging among community-dwelling older adults. Our primary objective was to design 
and implement a CPET protocol in older adults that was dependable, safe, 
scientifically valuable, and methodologically reliable.
METHODS: CPET was performed using treadmill exercise in 875 adults ≥70 years. A 
composite protocol included a symptom-limited peak exercise phase and two 
submaximal phases to assess cardiopulmonary ventilatory indices during 1) 
participants' preferred walking speed and 2) at slow walking speed of 1.5 mph 
(0.67 m/s). An adjudication process was in place to review tests for validity if 
they met any prespecified criteria (VO2peak <12.0 ml/kg/min; maximum heart rate 
(HR) <100 bpm; respiratory exchange ratio (RER) <1.05 and a rating of perceived 
exertion <15). A repeat test was performed in a subset (N=30) to assess 
reproducibility.
RESULTS: CPET was safe and well tolerated, with 95.8% of participants able to 
complete the VO2peak phase of the protocol. Only 56 (6.4%) participants had a 
risk alert during any phase of testing and only two adverse events occurred 
during the peak phase: a fall and atrial fibrillation. The average ± standard 
deviation for VO2peak was 20.2 ± 4.8 mL/kg/min, peak HR 142 ± 18 bpm, and peak 
RER 1.14 ± 0.09. VO2peak and RER were slightly higher in men than women. 
Adjudication was indicated in 47 participants; 20 were evaluated as valid, 27 as 
invalid (18 had a data collection error, 9 did not reach VO2peak). 
Reproducibility of VO2peak was high (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: CPET was feasible, effective and safe for community-dwelling older 
adults, many of whom had multimorbidity and frailty. These data support a 
broader implementation of CPET to provide important insight into the role of CRF 
and its underlying determinants in aging and age-related conditions and 
diseases.
CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE: What Is New?: Performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing 
in a community dwelling older adult with multimorbidities or frailty is feasible 
and exceptionally safe under highly trained exercise physiologists and physician 
supervision.Reproducibility of VO2peak among community-dwelling older adults 
with significant clinical complexity was high (intraclass correlation 
coefficient=0.97).The VO2peak observed was comparable to established normative 
data for older adults, and adds merit to the limited data collected on VO2peak 
norms in older adults.What Are the Clinical Implications?: Ventilatory gas 
collection during clinical cardiac stress testing may be valuable to plan of 
care in routine management of older adults due to the important role of aerobic 
fitness on morbidity and mortality.Cardiopulmonary exercise testing can provide 
insight into the role of cardiorespiratory fitness and its underlying 
determinants in aging and age-related conditions and diseases.

Movement flexibility and automaticity are necessary to successfully navigate 
different environments. When encountering difficult terrains such as a muddy 
trail, we can change how we step almost immediately so that we can continue 
walking. This flexibility comes at a cost since we initially must pay deliberate 
attention to how we are moving. Gradually, after a few minutes on the trail, 
stepping becomes automatic so that we do not need to think about our movements. 
Canonical theory indicates that different adaptive motor learning mechanisms 
confer these essential properties to movement: explicit control confers rapid 
flexibility, while forward model recalibration confers automaticity. Here we 
uncover a distinct mechanism of treadmill walking adaptation - an automatic 
stimulus-response mapping - that confers both properties to movement. The 
mechanism is flexible as it learns stepping patterns that can be rapidly changed 
to suit a range of treadmill configurations. It is also automatic as it can 
operate without deliberate control or explicit awareness by the participants. 
Our findings reveal a tandem architecture of forward model recalibration and 
automatic stimulus-response mapping mechanisms for walking, reconciling 
different findings of motor adaptation and perceptual realignment.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 
perturbation-based treadmill training on gait quality in daily life, a predictor 
of fall risk that was used as the primary outcome. An additional aim was to 
evaluate the effects on secondary outcomes, including balance, gait performance, 
self-efficacy, daily life physical activity, and falls.
METHODS: Seventy community-dwelling older adults (mean age = 74.73 [SD = 5.69] 
years; 46 women) at risk of falling were randomized and received 4 weeks of 
dual-task treadmill training, either with or without treadmill perturbations. 
Balance, gait performance, self-efficacy, and daily life trunk accelerometry at 
baseline, after intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up were assessed and 
compared within group over time and between groups for each time point, and 
their change rates between groups over time were also assessed.
RESULTS: Both groups improved in their balance, gait performance, and 
self-efficacy; the experimental group showed a significantly larger decrease in 
concern of falling and an increase in physical performance than the controls. 
These training effects did not translate into significant improvements in daily 
life gait quality or physical activity. However, the number of daily life falls 
and the percentage of fallers decreased significantly more in the experimental 
group.
CONCLUSION: A 4-week perturbation-based dual-task treadmill training program can 
improve self-efficacy, balance, and gait performance in a controlled setting and 
reduce daily life falls, although not through changes in quantity or quality of 
daily life gait.
IMPACT: Perturbation-based treadmill training is a safe and efficient way to 
train older adults' balance recovery and gait performance, increase 
self-efficacy, and prevent falls.

BACKGROUND: Burns constitute one of the foremost contributors to premature 
mortality and morbidity, and the recovery process from burn injuries is 
characterized by its intricate and protracted nature.
OBJECTIVE: The principal aim of this study was to assess the influence of an 
anti-gravity treadmill (Alter G) training program on both gait characteristics 
and postural stability indices (PSI) in adult individuals who have recovered 
from burns.
DESIGN: This study followed a single-blind, randomized, controlled design.
METHODS: A total of 45 adults, aged 18-35 years, with healed lower extremity 
burns that were circumferential and encompassed 35-50% of their total body 
surface area (TBSA) were randomly allocated to either the anti-gravity treadmill 
(Alter G) Training group (n = 22) or the traditional physical therapy program 
(TPTP) group (n=23). The TPTP group received conventional physical therapy, 
while the anti-gravity treadmill (Alter G) training group engaged in 
anti-gravity treadmill exercises alongside the traditional physical therapy 
program. The primary outcome measures, evaluated at both baseline and the 
conclusion of the 12-week intervention, included gait characteristics assessed 
using the GAITRite system and PSI measured by the Biodex Balance System (BBS).
RESULTS: The anti-gravity treadmill (Alter G) training group exhibited 
significantly greater enhancements than the TPTP group in terms of mean values 
and percentage changes in gait characteristics and PSI. Specifically, the 
percentage changes for the Alter G group were as follows: stride length 
(20.57%), step time (22.58%), step length (20.47%), velocity (15.67%), cadence 
(23.28%), and double support time (29.03%). In contrast, the TPTP group's 
percentage changes were: 6.73%, 8.19%, 7.65%, 7.75%, 8.89%, and 9.37%, 
respectively. Concerning PSI, the Alter G group exhibited percentage changes of 
55.17% for the medio-lateral stability index (MLI), 48.21% for antero-posterior 
stability index (API), and 48.48% for the overall stability index (OSI). The 
TPTP group's corresponding percentage changes were 20%, 14.03%, and 16.41%.
CONCLUSIONS: The amalgamation of anti-gravity treadmill training with the 
traditional physical therapy program yields greater efficacy than TPTP in 
isolation. Consequently, the findings underscore the efficiency of anti-gravity 
treadmill (Alter G) Training as a valuable tool for rehabilitating patients with 
burn injuries.

BACKGROUND: Delayed heart rate (HR) and blood pressure recovery after exercise 
test is known as the reliable indexes of autonomic dysfunction. Here we tried to 
evaluate the serial changes in various indicators during exercise test and 
correlations with recovery of HR and blood pressure in a normotensive healthy 
middle-aged group.
METHODS: A total of 122 patients without hypertension or diabetes was enrolled 
(mean age, 55.6 ± 11.0; male, 56.6%; mean blood pressure, 124.8 ± 16.6 / 81.5 ± 
9.6 mmHg). Treadmill test was performed for evaluation of chest pain. Patients 
with coronary artery disease, positive treadmill test result, left ventricular 
dysfunction or renal failure were excluded. Heart rate recovery was calculated 
by subtracting the HR in the first or second minute of recovery period from the 
HR of peak exercise (HRR1 or HRR2). Systolic blood pressure in the 4th minute of 
recovery stage (SBPR4) was used to show delayed blood pressure recovery.
RESULTS: Metabolic equivalents (METs) and HR in stage 2 to 4 were significantly 
correlated with both HRR1 and HRR2. Multiple regression analysis of HRR revealed 
significant correlation of METs and SBPR4. SBPR4 was significantly correlated 
with both HRR1 and HRR2 (HRR1, r = -0.376, p<0.001; HRR2, r = -0.244, p = 0.008) 
as well as SBP in the baseline to stage 3 and pulse pressure (r = 0.406, 
p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Delayed BP recovery after peak exercise test revealed significant 
association with autonomic dysfunction and increased pulse pressure in 
normotensive middle-aged healthy group. It can be a simple and useful marker of 
autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness.

BACKGROUND: Current studies on how external perturbations impact gait dynamics 
have primarily focused on the changes in the body's center of mass (CoM) during 
treadmill walking. The biomechanical responses, in particular to the 
multi-planar hip joint coordination, following perturbations in overground 
walking conditions are not completely known.
METHODS: In this study, a customized gait-perturbing device was designed to 
impose controlled lateral forces onto the subject's pelvis during overground 
walking. The biomechanical responses of bilateral hips were simulated by 
subject-specific neuromusculoskeletal models (NMS) driven by in-vivo motion 
data, which were further evaluated by statistical parameter mapping (SPM) and 
muscle coactivation index (CI) analysis. The validity of the subject-specific 
NMS was confirmed through comparison with measured surface electromyographic 
signals.
RESULTS: Following perturbations, the sagittal-plane hip motions were reduced 
for the leading leg by 18.39° and for the trailing leg by 8.23°, while motions 
in the frontal and transverse plane were increased, with increased hip abduction 
for the leading leg by 10.71° and external rotation by 9.06°, respectively. For 
the hip kinetics, both the bilateral hip joints showed increased abductor 
moments during midstance (20%-30% gait cycle) and decreased values during 
terminal stance (38%-48%). Muscle CI in both sagittal and frontal planes was 
significantly decreased for perturbed walking (p < 0.05), except for the leading 
leg in the sagittal plane.
CONCLUSION: The distinctive phase-dependent biomechanical response of the hip 
demonstrated its coordinated control strategy for balance recovery due to gait 
perturbations. And the changes in muscle CI suggested a potential mechanism for 
rapid and precise control of foot placement through modulation of joint 
stiffness properties. These findings obtained during actual overground 
perturbation conditions could have implications for the improved design of 
wearable robotic devices for balance assistance.

Water treadmill (WT) exercise may induce limb and back kinematics that meet 
specific training and rehabilitation goals. The study aimed to investigate the 
effects of walk speed, at different water depths (WDs), on limb and back 
kinematics of six Thoroughbreds exercising on a WT. Horses walked at 
2.8/4.3/5.5/6.0 km/h (i.e. 0.8/1.2/1.5/1.7 m/s) at dry, metacarpophalangeal and 
carpal WD. Videography captured limb movement in the sagittal plane. 
Motion-capture measured thoracolumbosacral flexion-extension (FE), and lateral 
bend (LB) ranges of movement (ROM) using skin surface markers on the sixth, 
tenth, thirteenth, eighteenth thoracic, third and fifth lumbar, and third sacral 
spinous processes. Inertial-motion-sensors measured poll, withers and pelvic 
displacements. Following preliminary univariable analyses, multivariable 
mixed-effects linear-regression analyses were used to examine the relationship 
between speed, WD and each outcome variable (P < 0.05). Peak 
metacarpophalangeal, carpal and tarsal joint flexion increased with speed 
(P ≤ 0.002) and depth combined (P 0.001) while peak metatarsophalangeal flexion 
increased with WD only (P 0.001). Thoracolumbar FE-ROM between T10 and L3 and 
hindlimb retraction was increased by speed and WD combined (P 0.001). Hindlimb 
protraction was increased by speed (P 0.001) while hindlimb retraction was 
increased by speed and WD combined (P 0.001). Dorsoventral poll displacement was 
increased by speed (P 0.001) and carpal WD (P = 0.013), craniocaudal poll 
displacement was increased by speed and WD combined (P 0.001). Pelvic (tubera 
coxae and sacrum) dorsoventral displacements increased with speed and WD 
combined (P 0.001). Understanding the effects of speed and WD on limb, back and 
pelvic kinematics will improve decision making relating to dry and WT exercise 
within training.

BACKGROUND: Perturbation-based training has shown to be effective in reducing 
fall-risk in people with chronic stroke (PwCS). However, most evidence comes 
from treadmill-based stance studies, with a lack of research focusing on 
training overground perturbed walking and exploring the relative contributions 
of the paretic and non-paretic limbs. This study thus examined whether PwCS 
could acquire motor adaptation and demonstrate immediate retention of 
fall-resisting skills following bilateral overground gait-slip perturbation 
training.
METHODS: 65 PwCS were randomly assigned to either (i) a training group, that 
received blocks of eight non-paretic (NP-S1 to NP-S8) and paretic (P-S1 to P-S8) 
overground slips during walking followed by a mixed block (seven non-paretic and 
paretic slips each interspersed with unperturbed walking trials) (NP-S9/P-S9 to 
NP-S15/P-S15) or (ii) a control group, that received a single non-paretic and 
paretic slip in random order. The assessor and training personnel were not 
blinded. Immediate retention was tested for the training group after a 30-minute 
rest break. Primary outcomes included laboratory-induced slip outcomes (falls 
and balance loss) and center of mass (CoM) state stability. Secondary outcomes 
to understand kinematic contributors to stability included recovery strategies, 
limb kinematics, slipping kinematics, and recovery stride length.
RESULTS: PwCS within the training group showed reduced falls (p < 0.01) and 
improved post-slip stability (p < 0.01) from the first trial to the last trial 
of both paretic and non-paretic slip blocks (S1 vs. S8). During the mixed block 
training, there was no further improvement in stability and slipping kinematics 
(S9 vs. S15) (p > 0.01). On comparing the first and last training trial (S1 vs. 
S15), post-slip stability improved on both non-paretic and paretic slips, 
however, pre-slip stability improved only on the non-paretic slip (p < 0.01). On 
the retention trials, the training group had fewer falls and greater post-slip 
stability than the control group on both non-paretic and paretic slips 
(p < 0.01). Post-slip stability on the paretic slip was lower than that on the 
non-paretic slip for both groups on retention trials (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: PwCS can reduce laboratory-induced slip falls and backward balance 
loss outcomes by adapting their post-slip CoM state stability after bilateral 
overground gait-slip perturbation training. Such reactive adaptations were 
better acquired and retained post-training in PwCS especially on the non-paretic 
slips than paretic slips, suggesting a need for higher dosage for paretic slips.

INTRODUCTION: The subject of this study was the creation of a new type of 
laboratory walking stress test for the Special Forces of the Army of the Czech 
Republic. This study developed a test model that has been validated in practice 
and that reflects the fact that the performance of endurance without and with a 
load varies considerably. Especially, if we focus on operators, as their 
activities are always performed with loads/full gear (equipment, weapons, 
equipment, etc.).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 24 men/operators from the Special Forces of the Army of 
the Czech Republic volunteered for this study. The maximal exercise 
test/spiroergometry was designed to include performance at a load of 55 kg/121 
lb, a constant speed of 5.3 km/h, and an increase in incline angle of 1 degree 
after each elapsed minute. The test was performed on a treadmill under standard 
time, location, and temperature conditions. During the test, the following 
values were recorded: VO2 = oxygen consumption indicating the intensity of the 
exercise was monitored, VO2/kg = oxygen consumption converted to body weight, 
VO2/HR = pulse oxygen (the amount of oxygen converted in one heartbeat), 
HR = heart rate, VE = ventilation, volume of air exhaled in 1 min, breathe 
frequency (BF) = respiratory rate in 1 min.
RESULTS: Out of the total number of 24 respondents, the study found these mean 
values of variables. The variable mapping the oxygen consumption, which 
indicates the intensity of VO2 loading, was 3.8, with the lowest value being 3.2 
and the highest being 4.5. After converting oxygen consumption to bodyweight, 
VO2/kg was 46, the lowest value of 38.8, and the highest 53.0 were measured for 
this variable. Pulse oxygen, i.e., the amount of oxygen calculated per heart 
contraction VO2/HR, was 20.5, the lowest value 16.0, and the highest 26.0. The 
average HR heart rate was 183.5, with the lowest value being recorded at 164 and 
the highest value is 205. Ventilation, i.e., the amount of exhaled air per 
minute in VE, was measured at 144.9, the lowest value was 114.7, and the highest 
was 176.6. The BF in 1 min was 58.5, the lowest value 35, and the highest 70. 
The mean time load was 10:20 min, the shortest test length was 7:25 min, and the 
longest was 13:23 min. These values correspond to the degree of inclination of 
the ascent, i.e., the mean value was 10 degrees, the smallest achieved slope was 
7 degrees, and the largest 13 degrees.
CONCLUSION: The designed weighted walking test proved to be fully functional and 
effective in measurement. The further established protocol corresponds to the 
requirements of the current needs of the Special Forces of the Army of the Czech 
Republic. Last but not least, the walking stress test is applied for the 
external and internal selection and screening of operators. Data obtained from 
testing were used to develop deployment requirements for patrol/nuclear combat 
missions.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the metabolic cost (C), 
mechanical work, and kinematics of walking on a multidirectional treadmill 
designed for locomotion in virtual reality.
METHODS: Ten participants (5 females, body mass 67.2 ± 8.1 kg, height 
1.71 ± 0.07 m, age 23.6 ± 1.9 years, mean ± SD) walked on a Virtuix Omni 
multidirectional treadmill at four imposed stride frequencies: 0.70, 0.85, 1.00, 
and 1.15 Hz. A portable metabolic system measured oxygen uptake, enabling 
calculation of C and the metabolic equivalent of task (MET). Gait kinematics and 
external, internal, and total mechanical work (WTOT) were calculated by an 
optoelectronic system. Efficiency was calculated either as WTOT/C or by summing 
WTOT to the work against sliding frictions. Results were compared with normal 
walking, running, and skipping.
RESULTS: C was higher for walking on the multidirectional treadmill than for 
normal walking, running, and skipping, and decreased with speed (best-fit 
equation: C = 20.2-27.5·speed + 15.8·speed2); the average MET was 4.6 ± 1.4. 
Mechanical work was higher at lower speeds, but similar to that of normal 
walking at higher speeds, with lower pendular energy recovery and efficiency; 
differences in efficiency were explained by the additional work against sliding 
frictions. At paired speeds, participants showed a more forward-leaned trunk and 
higher ankle dorsiflexion, stride frequency, and duty factor than normal 
walking.
CONCLUSION: Walking on a multidirectional treadmill requires a higher metabolic 
cost and different mechanical work and kinematics than normal walking. This 
raises questions on its use for gait rehabilitation but highlights its potential 
for high-intensity exercise and physical activity promotion.

Single therapeutic interventions have not yet been successful in restoring 
function after spinal cord injury. Accordingly, combinatorial interventions 
targeting multiple factors may hold greater promise for achieving maximal 
functional recovery. In this study, we applied a combinatorial approach of 
chronic chemogenetic neuronal activation and physical exercise including 
treadmill running and forelimb training tasks to promote functional recovery. In 
a mouse model of cervical (C5) dorsal hemisection of the spinal cord, which 
transects almost all descending corticospinal tract axons, combining selective 
activation of corticospinal motoneurons (CMNs) by intersectional chemogenetics 
with physical exercise significantly promoted functional recovery evaluated by 
the grid walking test, grid hanging test, rotarod test, and single 
pellet-reaching tasks. Electromyography and histological analysis showed 
increased activation of forelimb muscles via chemogenetic stimuli, and a greater 
density of vGlut1+ innervation in spinal cord grey matter rostral to the injury, 
suggesting enhanced neuroplasticity and connectivity. Combined therapy also 
enhanced activation of mTOR signaling and reduced apoptosis in spinal 
motoneurons, Counts revealed increased numbers of detectable choline 
acetyltransferase-positive motoneurons in the ventral horn. Taken together, the 
findings from this study validate a novel combinatorial approach to enhance 
motor function after spinal cord injury.

Gait rehabilitation commonly relies on bodyweight unloading mechanisms, such as 
overhead mechanical support and underwater buoyancy. Lightweight and wireless 
inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors provide a cost-effective tool for 
quantifying body segment motions without the need for video recordings or ground 
reaction force measures. Identifying the instant when the foot contacts and 
leaves the ground from IMU data can be challenging, often requiring scrupulous 
parameter selection and researcher supervision. We aimed to assess the use of 
machine learning methods for gait event detection based on features from foot 
segment rotational velocity using foot-worn IMU sensors during 
bodyweight-supported treadmill walking on land and underwater. Twelve healthy 
subjects completed on-land treadmill walking with overhead mechanical bodyweight 
support, and three subjects completed underwater treadmill walking. We placed 
IMU sensors on the foot and recorded motion capture and ground reaction force 
data on land and recorded IMU sensor data from wireless foot pressure insoles 
underwater. To detect gait events based on IMU data features, we used random 
forest machine learning classification. We achieved high gait event detection 
accuracy (95-96%) during on-land bodyweight-supported treadmill walking across a 
range of gait speeds and bodyweight support levels. Due to biomechanical changes 
during underwater treadmill walking compared to on land, accurate underwater 
gait event detection required specific underwater training data. Using 
single-axis IMU data and machine learning classification, we were able to 
effectively identify gait events during bodyweight-supported treadmill walking 
on land and underwater. Robust and automated gait event detection methods can 
enable advances in gait rehabilitation.

Prolonged gaze at a smartphone is characterized by pronounced flexion of the 
cervical spine and is associated with health risks. In addition, it is suspected 
that smartphone distraction could lead to gait changes. Therefore, the aim of 
this study was to detect smartphone-associated postural changes at thoracic and 
lumbar levels as well as gait changes. Spinal analysis was performed 
prospectively in 21 healthy men using the DIERS 4Dmotion®Lab in a controlled 
crossover design to evaluate posture-associated parameters while standing and 
walking. The examination sequence provided three randomized gaze directions: GN 
= Gaze Neutral; S1H = Smartphone one-handed; S2H = Smartphone two-handed. 
Results reveal a higher vertebra prominens (VP)-flexion in S1H (23.8° ± 6.9°; p 
≤ 0.001) and S2H (22.4° ± 4.7°; p ≤ 0.001) compared to GN (17.6° ± 3.8°). 
Kyphosis angles were also different with higher values observed in S1H (58.8° ± 
5.8°; p ≤ 0.001) and S2H (61.6° ± 4.9°; p ≤ 0.001) compared to GN (49.1° ± 
4.6°). During walking, similar results were observed in kyphosis angles. No 
differences were observed in gait during smartphone use (p = 0.180-0.883). The 
study revealed a significantly increased inclination of the lower cervical and 
thoracic spine during smartphone use. However, the inclination was larger during 
S2H. Standing or walking conditions did not affect the measurement outcomes. 
Long-term smartphone use associated with a larger inclination of the cervical 
and thoracic spine might result in increased pressure and shear forces acting on 
vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, and muscles, which potentially increases 
the risk of spinal pain and disease.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders 
that causes postural instability and gait alterations, such as reduced walking 
speed, shorter step length, and gait asymmetry, exposing patients to a higher 
risk of falling. Recently, virtual reality (VR) was added to a treadmill, in 
order to promote motor functional recovery and neuroplastic processes. Twenty PD 
patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups: the experimental 
group (EG) and the control group (CG). In particular, patients in the EG were 
trained with the C-Mill, an innovative type of treadmill, which is equipped with 
semi-immersive VR, whereas the CG performed conventional physiotherapy. Patients 
in both groups were evaluated through a specific motor assessment battery at 
baseline (T0) and after the training (T1). Comparing pre-(T0) and post-(T1) 
treatment scores, in the EG, we found statistical significances in the following 
outcome measures: 6 Minutes Walking Test (6MWT) (p < 0.0005), Timed up and go 
(TUG right) (p < 0.03), Berg Balance Scale (BBS) (p < 0.006), Tinetti Scale (TS) 
(p < 0.002), Falls Efficacy Scale- International (FES-I), (p < 0.03) Unified PD 
Rating Scale-III (UPDRS) (p < 0.002), and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) 
(p < 0.004). Also, the CG showed statistical significances after the training. 
Between-group (EG and CG) analysis showed significative statistical differences 
in 6MWT (p < 0.006), BBS (p < 0.006), TS (p < 0.008), FES-I (p < 0.01), and FIM 
(p < 0.009). From our results it emerges that both groups (EG and CG) achieved 
better outcome scores after the treatment, suggesting that both physiotherapy 
interventions were effective. However, the EG training using VR seemed to have 
induced more improvements, especially in gait and balance skills. Then, C-Mill 
could be a valid adjunctive treatment in the context of gait and balance 
disturbances, which are very common in the PD population.

BACKGROUND: Aging increases individual susceptibility to falls and injuries, 
suggesting poorer adaptation of balance responses to perturbation during 
locomotion, which can be measured with the locomotor adaptation task (LAT). 
However, it is unclear how aging and lifestyle factors affect these responses 
during walking. Hence, the present study investigates the relationship between 
balance and lifestyle factors during the LAT in healthy individuals across the 
adult lifespan using a correlational design.
METHODS: Thirty participants aged 20-78 years performed an LAT on a split-belt 
treadmill (SBT). We evaluated the magnitude and rate of adaptation and 
deadaptation during the LAT. Participants reported their lifelong physical and 
cognitive activity.
RESULTS: Age positively correlated with gait-line length asymmetry at the late 
post-adaptation phase (p = 0.007). These age-related effects were mediated by 
recent physical activity levels (p = 0.040).
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that locomotor adaptive responses are preserved 
in aging, but the ability to deadapt newly learnt balance responses is 
compromised with age. Physical activity mediates these age-related effects. 
Therefore, gait symmetry post-adaptation could effectively measure the risk of 
falling, and maintaining physical activity could protect against declines in 
balance.

Precision walking (PW) incorporates precise step adjustments into regular 
walking patterns to navigate challenging surroundings. However, the brain 
processes involved in PW control, which encompass cortical regions and 
interregional interactions, are not fully understood. This study aimed to 
investigate the changes in regional activity and effective connectivity within 
the frontoparietal network associated with PW. Functional near-infrared 
spectroscopy data were recorded from adult subjects during treadmill walking 
tasks, including normal walking (NOR) and PW with visual cues, wherein the 
intercue distance was either fixed (FIX) or randomly varied (VAR) across steps. 
The superior parietal lobule (SPL), dorsal premotor area (PMd), supplementary 
motor area (SMA), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) were specifically 
targeted. The results revealed higher activities in SMA and left PMd, as well as 
left-to-right SPL connectivity, in VAR than in FIX. Activities in SMA and right 
dlPFC, along with dlPFC-to-SPL connectivity, were higher in VAR than in NOR. 
Overall, these findings provide insights into the roles of different brain 
regions and connectivity patterns within the frontoparietal network in 
facilitating gait control during PW, providing a useful baseline for further 
investigations into brain networks involved in locomotion.

Ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) is known to correct abnormal gait patterns and improve 
walking stability and speed in patients with hemiparesis. To quantify these 
benefits in post-stroke gait, a three-dimensional motion analysis of gait 
pattern was conducted. Forty patients with hemiparesis were enrolled. A 
three-dimensional motion analysis system was used to analyze patients' treadmill 
walking with/without an AFO. Outcome measures were 12 abnormal gait indices 
(forefoot contact, knee extensor thrust, retropulsion of the hip, flexed-knee 
gait, medial whip in the stance phase, circumduction gait, hip hiking, 
insufficient knee flexion during the swing phase, excessive lateral shifting of 
the trunk, contralateral vaulting, excessive hip external rotation, and 
posterior pelvic tilt), calculated using kinematic data and spatiotemporal 
indices, and the symmetry index of double-stance and single-stance time and step 
length. Forefoot contact (without AFO vs. with AFO: 71.0 vs. 65.8, P < 0.001), 
circumduction gait (65.0 vs. 57.9, P < 0.001), and contralateral vaulting (78.2 
vs. 72.2, P = 0.003) were significantly reduced, whereas excessive hip external 
rotation (53.7 vs. 62.8, P = 0.003) significantly increased during walking with 
an AFO. Hip hiking (77.1 vs. 71.7) showed marginal reduction with the use of AFO 
( P = 0.096). The absolute symmetry index of double-stance time (21.9 vs. 16.1, 
P = 0.014) significantly decreased during walking with an AFO. AFO effectively 
mitigates abnormal gait patterns typical of hemiparetic gait. A 3D motion 
analysis system with clinically oriented indices can help assess intervention 
efficacy for gait abnormalities.

PURPOSE: Surgeons want to achieve native kinematics in primary total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA). Cruciate-substituting (CS) implants could restore the knee 
kinematics more efficiently than posterior-stabilised (PS) TKA. This study aimed 
to compare gait patterns in patients with CS or PS TKA at 6 months. The 
hypothesis was that CS implants would demonstrate comparable gait parameters to 
PS implants at 6 months.
METHODS: In this prospective case-control study, 38 primary TKA without coronal 
laxity were divided into 2 groups: 19 cruciate-substituting (CS) and 19 
posterior-stabilised (PS) implants. The type of prosthesis was determined 
according to the surgical period. Exclusion criteria were TKA revision, 
associated procedures and inability to walk on a treadmill. Gait analysis was 
conducted on a treadmill 6 months postoperatively for each patient with a knee 
assessment device (KneeKG®). Gait characteristics included analysis in three 
spatial dimensions (flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, internal-external 
rotation, anterior-posterior translation). Clinical outcomes (Knee Society Score 
and Forgotten Joint Score) were compared between both groups at 6 months 
postoperatively.
RESULTS: At 6 months, the gait analysis did not demonstrate any significant 
difference between CS and PS implants. The range and the maximum anteroposterior 
translation were similar in both groups (9.2 ± 6.5 mm in CS group vs. 8.1 ± 3 mm 
in PS group (n.s.); and - 5.2 ± 5 mm in CS group vs. - 6.3 ± 5.9 mm in PS group 
(n.s.), respectively). The internal/external rotation, the flexion, and the 
varus angle were similar between CS and PS implants. The KSS Knee score was 
higher at 6 months in the CS group than in the PS group (92.1 ± 5.6 vs. 
84.8 ± 8.9 (p < 0.01)).
CONCLUSION: Cruciate-substituting and posterior-stabilised TKA had similar gait 
patterns at 6 months postoperatively, despite a non-equivalent posterior 
stabilisation system. CS prostheses were an interesting option for primary TKA 
for knee kinematics restoration without requiring a femoral box.

Movement Artifact Suppression in Wearable Low-Density and Dry EEG Recordings 
Using Active Electrodes and Artifact Subspace Reconstruction.

Yang SY, Lin YP.

Wearable low-density dry electroencephalogram (EEG) headsets facilitate 
multidisciplinary applications of brain-activity decoding and brain-triggered 
interaction for healthy people in real-world scenarios. However, movement 
artifacts pose a great challenge to their validity in users with naturalistic 
behaviors (i.e., without highly controlled settings in a laboratory). 
High-precision, high-density EEG instruments commonly embed an active electrode 
infrastructure and/or incorporate an auxiliary artifact subspace reconstruction 
(ASR) pipeline to handle movement artifact interferences. Existing endeavors 
motivate this study to explore the efficacy of both hardware and software 
solutions in low-density and dry EEG recordings against non-tethered settings, 
which are rarely found in the literature. Therefore, this study employed a 
LEGO-like electrode-holder assembly grid to coordinate three 3-channel system 
designs (with passive/active dry vs. passive wet electrodes). It also conducted 
a simultaneous EEG recording while performing an oddball task during treadmill 
walking, with speeds of 1 and 2 KPH. The quantitative metrics of pre-stimulus 
noise, signal-to-noise ratio, and inter-subject correlation from the collected 
event-related potentials of 18 subjects were assessed. Results indicate that 
while treating a passive-wet system as benchmark, only the active-electrode 
design more or less rectified movement artifacts for dry electrodes, whereas the 
ASR pipeline was substantially compromised by limited electrodes. These findings 
suggest that a lightweight, minimally obtrusive dry EEG headset should at least 
equip an active-electrode infrastructure to withstand realistic movement 
artifacts for potentially sustaining its validity and applicability in 
real-world scenarios.

BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to compare the effects of simultaneous 
cognitive and motor tasks on walking performance between individuals with 
nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) and healthy controls.
METHODS: A total of 20 patients with NSCLBP and 20 healthy controls participated 
in this study. They walked at their self-selected speed on a treadmill under 3 
walking conditions in a randomized order: walking only, walking while performing 
a concurrent cognitive task, and walking while performing a concurrent motor 
task. Two-way repeated measure analysis of variance with additional post hoc 
comparison (Bonferroni test) was used to evaluate the effects of group and 
walking conditions on gait parameters.
RESULTS: The result showed a significant main effect of the group for swing time 
( P = 0.012) and double support time (P = 0.021) in those with NSCLBP compared 
with healthy controls. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between the 
group and condition for cadence ( P = 0.004) and step width variability (P = 
0.016).Regarding stride length variability and stride time variability, the 
analysis indicated a significant effect of condition (P = 0.002 and P = 0.030, 
respectively). In both groups, no significant differences were observed in gait 
parameters between motor dual task and single walking ( P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that those with NSCLBP adapted successfully 
to walking performance to maintain the performance of the concurrent cognitive 
task under the cognitive dual-task walking condition. Moreover, the present 
study observed no dual-task interference under the motor dual-task condition.

BACKGROUND: 'Perturbation-based balance training' (PBBT) is a training method 
that was developed to improve balance reactive responses to unexpected balance 
loss. This training method is more effective in reducing fall rates than 
traditional balance training methods. Many PBBTs are performed during standing 
or treadmill walking which targeted specifically step reactive responses, we 
however, aimed to develop and build a mechatronic system that can provide 
unexpected perturbation during elliptical walking the Elliptical Perturbation 
System (the EPES system), with the aim of improving specifically the trunk and 
upper limbs balance reactive control.
METHODS: This paper describes the development, and building of the EPES system, 
using a stationary Elliptical Exercise device, which allows training of trunk 
and upper limbs balance reactive responses in older adults.
RESULTS: The EPES system provides 3-dimensional small, controlled, and 
unpredictable sudden perturbations during stationary elliptical walking. We 
developed software that can identify a trainee's trunk and arms reactive balance 
responses using a stereo camera. After identifying an effective trunk and arms 
reactive balance response, the software controls the EPES system motors to 
return the system to its horizontal baseline position after the perturbation. 
The system thus provides closed-loop feedback for a person's counterbalancing 
trunk and arm responses, helping to implement implicit motor learning for the 
trainee. The pilot results show that the EPES software can successfully identify 
balance reactive responses among participants who are exposed to a sudden 
unexpected perturbation during elliptical walking on the EPES system.
CONCLUSIONS: EPES trigger reactive balance responses involving counter-rotation 
action of body segments and simultaneously evoke arms, and trunk reactive 
response, thus reactive training effects should be expected.

BACKGROUND: Optic flow-the apparent visual motion experienced while moving-is 
absent during treadmill walking. With virtual reality (VR), optic flow can be 
controlled to mediate alterations in human walking. The aim of this study was to 
investigate (1) the effects of fully immersive VR and optic flow speed 
manipulation on gait biomechanics, simulator sickness, and enjoyment in people 
post-stroke and healthy people, and (2) the effects of the level of immersion on 
optic flow speed and sense of presence.
METHODS: Sixteen people post-stroke and 16 healthy controls performed two 
VR-enhanced treadmill walking sessions: the semi-immersive GRAIL session and 
fully immersive head-mounted display (HMD) session. Both consisted of five 
walking trials. After two habituation trials (without and with VR), participants 
walked three more trials under the following conditions: matched, slow, and fast 
optic flow. Primary outcome measures were spatiotemporal parameters and lower 
limb kinematics. Secondary outcomes (simulator sickness, enjoyment, and sense of 
presence) were assessed with the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, Visual 
Analogue Scales, and Igroup Presence Questionnaire.
RESULTS: When walking with the immersive HMD, the stroke group walked with a 
significantly slower cadence (-3.69strides/min, p = 0.006), longer stride time 
(+ 0.10 s, p = 0.017) and stance time for the unaffected leg (+ 1.47%, 
p = 0.001) and reduced swing time for the unaffected leg (- 1.47%, p = 0.001). 
Both groups responded to the optic flow speed manipulation such that people 
accelerated with a slow optic flow and decelerated with a fast optic flow. 
Compared to the semi-immersive GRAIL session, manipulating the optic flow speed 
with the fully immersive HMD had a greater effect on gait biomechanics whilst 
also eliciting a higher sense of presence.
CONCLUSION: Adding fully immersive VR while walking on a self-paced treadmill 
led to a more cautious gait pattern in people post-stroke. However, walking with 
the HMD was well tolerated and enjoyable. People post-stroke altered their gait 
parameters when optic flow speed was manipulated and showed greater alterations 
with the fully-immersive HMD. Further work is needed to determine the most 
effective type of optic flow speed manipulation as well as which other 
principles need to be implemented to positively influence the gait pattern of 
people post-stroke.

METHODS: This was an open, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Patients 
with intermittent claudication attending vascular surgery outpatient clinics 
were randomized (1:1) to receive either neuromuscular electrical stimulation 
(NMES) or not in addition to local standard care available at study centres 
(best medical therapy alone or plus supervised exercise therapy (SET)). The 
objective of this trial was to investigate the clinical efficacy of an NMES 
device in addition to local standard care in improving walking distances in 
patients with claudication. The primary outcome was change in absolute walking 
distance, measured by a standardized treadmill test at 3 months. Secondary 
outcomes included intermittent claudication (IC) distance, adherence, quality of 
life, and haemodynamic changes.
RESULTS: Of 200 participants randomized, 160 were included in the primary 
analysis (intention to treat, Tobit regression model). The square root of 
absolute walking distance was analysed (due to a right-skewed distribution) and, 
although adjunctive NMES improved it at 3 months, no statistically significant 
effect was observed. SET as local standard care seemed to improve distance 
compared to best medical therapy at 3 months (3.29 units; 95 per cent c.i., 1.77 
to 4.82; P < 0.001). Adjunctive NMES improved distance in mild claudication 
(2.88 units; 95 per cent c.i., 0.51 to 5.25; P = 0.02) compared to local 
standard care at 3 months. No serious adverse events relating to the device were 
reported.
CONCLUSION: Supervised exercise therapy is effective and NMES may provide 
further benefit in mild IC.This trial was supported by a grant from the Efficacy 
and Mechanism Evaluation Program, a Medical Research Council and National 
Institute for Health and Care Research partnership. Trial registration: 
ISRCTN18242823.

Plain Language Summary: Patients with intermittent claudication experience pain 
in their legs during walking or exercise which ends with rest. This severely 
impairs physical activity and quality of life. Treatment for such patients 
typically involves best medical therapy, which includes exercise advice. This 
study aimed to determine whether a neuromuscular electrical stimulation device 
improved the walking distance of patients with intermittent claudication 
compared to local standard care available (which may include supervised exercise 
therapy) in a trial. Supervised exercise improved walking distances but there 
was no difference in those that received a device in this patient group.

INTRODUCTION: Recent advancements in functional near-infrared spectroscopy 
technology have offered a portable, wireless, wearable solution to measure the 
activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the human neuroscience field. This 
study is the first to validate the different contributions made by the PFC's 
eight subregions in healthy young adults to the reactive recovery responses 
following treadmill-induced unpredictable slip perturbations and vibrotactile 
cueing (i.e., precues).
METHODS: Our fall-inducing technology platform equipped with a split-belt 
treadmill provided unpredictable slip perturbations to healthy young adults 
while walking at their self-selected walking speed. A portable, wireless, 
wearable, and multi-channel (48 channels) functional near-infrared spectroscopy 
system evaluated the activity of PFC's eight subregions [i.e., right and left 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), 
frontopolar prefrontal cortex (FPFC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)] as 
quantified by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations. A motion capture 
system and two force plates beneath the split-belt treadmill were used to 
quantify participants' kinematic and kinetic behavior. All participants 
completed 6 trials: 2 consecutive trials without vibrotactile cueing and with a 
slip perturbation (control trials); 3 trials with vibrotactile cueing [2 trials 
with the slip perturbation (cueing trial) and 1 trial without the slip 
perturbation (catch trial)], and 1 trial without vibrotactile cueing and with a 
slip perturbation (post-control trial). The PFC subregions' activity and 
kinematic behavior were assessed during the three periods (i.e., standing, 
walking, and recovery periods).
RESULTS: Compared to the walkers' standing and walking periods, recovery periods 
showed significantly higher and lower levels of oxyhemoglobin and 
deoxyhemoglobin concentrations, respectively, in the right and left DLPFC, 
VLPFC, and FPFC, regardless of the presence of vibrotactile cueing. However, 
there was no significant difference in the right and left OFC between the three 
periods. Kinematic analyses confirmed that vibrotactile cueing significantly 
improved reactive recovery responses without requiring more involvement by the 
PFC subregions, which suggests that the sum of attentional resources is similar 
in cued and non-cued motor responses.
DISCUSSION: The results could inform the design of wearable technologies that 
alert their users to the risks of falling and assist with the development of new 
gait perturbation paradigms that prompt reactive responses.

Introduction: Tuning the control parameters is one of the main challenges in 
robotic gait therapy. Control strategies that vary the control parameters based 
on the user's performance are still scarce and do not exploit the potential of 
using spatiotemporal metrics. The goal of this study was to validate the 
feasibility of using shank-worn Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) for clinical 
gait analysis after stroke and evaluate their preliminary applicability in 
designing an automatic and adaptive controller for a knee exoskeleton (ABLE-KS). 
Methods: First, we estimated the temporal (i.e., stride time, stance, and swing 
duration) and spatial (i.e., stride length, maximum vertical displacement, foot 
clearance, and circumduction) metrics in six post-stroke participants while 
walking on a treadmill and overground and compared these estimates with data 
from an optical motion tracking system. Next, we analyzed the relationships 
between the IMU-estimated metrics and an exoskeleton control parameter related 
to the peak knee flexion torque. Finally, we trained two machine learning 
algorithms, i.e., linear regression and neural network, to model the 
relationship between the exoskeleton torque and maximum vertical displacement, 
which was the metric that showed the strongest correlations with the data from 
the optical system [r = 0.84; ICC(A,1) = 0.73; ICC(C,1) = 0.81] and peak knee 
flexion torque (r = 0.957). Results: Offline validation of both neural network 
and linear regression models showed good predictions (R2 = 0.70-0.80; MAE = 
0.48-0.58 Nm) of the peak torque based on the maximum vertical displacement 
metric for the participants with better gait function, i.e., gait speed > 
0.7 m/s. For the participants with worse gait function, both models failed to 
provide good predictions (R2 = 0.00-0.19; MAE = 1.15-1.29 Nm) of the peak torque 
despite having a moderate-to-strong correlation between the spatiotemporal 
metric and control parameter. Discussion: Our preliminary results indicate that 
the stride-by-stride estimations of shank-worn IMUs show potential to design 
automatic and adaptive exoskeleton control strategies for people with moderate 
impairments in gait function due to stroke.

Purposeful movement across unpredictable environments requires quick, accurate, 
and contextually appropriate motor corrections in response to disruptions in 
balance and posture.1,2,3 These responses must respect both the current position 
and limitations of the body, as well as the surrounding environment,4,5,6 and 
involve a combination of segmental reflexes in the spinal cord, vestibulospinal 
and reticulospinal pathways in the brainstem, and forebrain structures such as 
the motor cortex.7,8,9,10 These motor plans can be heavily influenced by the 
animal's surrounding environment, even when that environment has no mechanical 
influence on the perturbation itself. This environmental influence has been 
considered as cortical in nature, priming motor responses to a perturbation.8,11 
Similarly, postural responses can be influenced by environments that alter 
threat levels in humans.12,13,14,15,16,17,18 Such studies are generally in 
agreement with work done in the mouse showing that optogenetic stimulation of 
the lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN) only results in motor responses when the 
animal is on a balance beam at height and not when walking on the stable surface 
of a treadmill.10 In general, this ability to flexibly modify postural responses 
across terrains and environmental conditions is a critically important component 
of the balance system.19,20 Here we show that LVN-generated motor corrections 
can be altered by manipulating the surrounding environment. Furthermore, 
environmental influence on corrections requires noradrenergic signaling from the 
locus coeruleus, suggesting a potential link between forebrain structures that 
convey sensory information about the environment and brainstem circuits that 
generate motor corrections.

OBJECTIVES: Compare and assess relationships between strength and running 
biomechanics among healthy adolescents and young adult males and females.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
SETTING: Clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: 802 healthy participants (570 F, 232 M; 16.6 ± 2.3 years).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mass-normalized knee flexor and extensor strength, hip 
adductor and abductor strength, hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q), and 
abductor-to-adductor (Abd:Add) ratios were obtained using hand-held dynamometry. 
Mass-normalized peak vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), %stance, cadence, 
and stride length were obtained using an instrumented treadmill. Multivariate 
analyses of variance were used to compare strength and biomechanics across ages 
and sexes. Linear regressions were used to assess the relationships between 
strength and biomechanics, accounting for speed, age, and sex. Independent 
t-tests were used to compare strength between strength ratio profiles.
RESULTS: Strength and running biomechanics significantly differed between sexes 
(p-range: <0.001-0.05) and age groups (p-range: <0.001-0.02). Strength and 
strength ratios were significantly associated with increased cadence 
(p-range:0.001-0.04) and stride lengths (p-range:0.004-0.03), and decreased vGRF 
(p < 0.001). Lower H:Q ratios had significantly lower strength measures 
(p < 0.001). Higher Abd:Add ratios had significantly increased abductor strength 
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Strength and running biomechanics differed by sexes and ages. Hip 
and knee strength and strength ratios were related to select spatiotemporal and 
kinetic biomechanical features.

Chronic exposure to high tibiofemoral joint (TFJ) contact forces can be 
detrimental to knee joint health. Load carriage increases TFJ contact forces, 
but it is unclear whether medial and lateral tibiofemoral compartments respond 
similarly to incremental load carriage. The purpose of our study was to compare 
TFJ contact forces when walking with 15% and 30% added body weight. Young 
healthy adults (n = 24) walked for 5 minutes with no load, 15% load, and 30% 
load on an instrumented treadmill. Total, medial, and lateral TFJ contact peak 
forces and impulses were calculated via an inverse dynamics informed 
musculoskeletal model. Results of 1-way repeated measures analyses of variance 
(α = .05) demonstrated total, medial, and lateral TFJ first peak contact forces 
and impulses increased significantly with increasing load. Orthogonal polynomial 
trends demonstrated that the 30% loading condition led to a curvilinear increase 
in total and lateral TFJ impulses, whereas medial first peak TFJ contact forces 
and impulses responded linearly to increasing load. The total and lateral 
compartment impulse increased disproportionally with load carriage, while the 
medial did not. The medial and lateral compartments responded differently to 
increasing load during walking, warranting further investigation because it may 
relate to risk of osteoarthritis.

BACKGROUND: Higher impact loading during walking is implicated in the 
pathogenesis of knee osteoarthritis. Accelerometry enables the measurement of 
peak tibial acceleration outside the laboratory. We characterized the relations 
of peak tibial acceleration to knee pain and impact loading during walking in 
adults with knee osteoarthritis.
METHODS: Adults with knee osteoarthritis reported knee pain then walked at a 
self-selected speed on an instrumented treadmill for 3 min with an ankle-worn 
inertial measurement unit. Ground reaction forces and tibial acceleration data 
were sampled for 1 min. Vertical impact peaks, and average and peak 
instantaneous load rates were determined and averaged across 10 steps. Peak 
tibial acceleration was extracted for all steps and averaged. Pearson's 
correlations and multiple linear regression analyses assessed the relation of 
peak tibial acceleration to pain and impact loading metrics, independently and 
after controlling for gait speed and pain.
FINDINGS: Higher peak tibial acceleration was associated with worse knee pain 
(r = 0.39; p = 0.01), and higher vertical average (r = 0.40; p = 0.01) and 
instantaneous (r = 0.46; p = 0.004) load rates. After adjusting for gait speed 
and pain, peak tibial acceleration was a significant predictor of vertical 
average (R2 = 0.33; p = 0.003) and instantaneous (R2 = 0.28; p = 0.02) load 
rates, but not strongly associated with vertical impact peak.
INTERPRETATIONS: Peak tibial acceleration during walking is associated with knee 
pain and vertical load rates in those with knee osteoarthritis. Clinicians can 
easily access measures of peak tibial acceleration with wearable sensors 
equipped with accelerometers. Future work should determine the feasibility of 
improving patient outcomes by using peak tibial acceleration to inform clinical 
management.

Patients with cerebellar stroke display relatively mild ataxic gaits. These 
motor deficits often improve dramatically; however, the neural mechanisms of 
this improvement have yet to be elucidated. Previous studies in mouse models of 
gait ataxia, such as ho15J mice and cbln1-null mice, have shown that they have a 
dysfunction of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum. However, 
the effects of cerebellar stroke on the locomotor kinematics of wild-type mice 
are currently unknown. Here, we performed a kinematic analysis of gait ataxia 
caused by a photothrombotic stroke in the medial, vermal, and intermediate 
regions of the cerebellum of wild-type mice. We used the data and observations 
from this analysis to develop a model that will allow locomotive prognosis and 
indicate potential treatment regimens following a cerebellar stroke. Our 
analysis showed that mice performed poorly in a ladder rung test after a stroke. 
During walking on a treadmill, the mice with induced cerebellar stroke had an 
increased duty ratio of the hindlimb caused by shortened duration of the swing 
phase. Overall, our findings suggest that photothrombotic cerebellar infarction 
and kinematic gait analyses will provide a useful model for quantification of 
different types of acute management of cerebellar stroke in rodents.

Impact of Blood Flow Restriction Exercise on Central Hemodynamics and Fluid 
Regulating Hormones.

CANADA.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to characterize both the efficacy of 
altered restriction pressures and consequences of optimized blood flow 
restriction (BFR) for altering the cardiovascular and fluid regulating response 
in humans.
METHODS: This work comprised a series of related trials. Phase 1: during 
semi-recumbent cycling (5 min, 60 W) with BFR at 0%, 50%, 75%, 100%, and 125% of 
participants' lowest arterial occlusion pressure (LOP) echocardiographic images 
were collected alongside continuous heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). In 
phase 2, 24 h fluid balance (intake-output) and fluid-regulating hormone 
responses were measured after a practical BFR exercise session (treadmill 
walking: 5·3 min, 1 min rest, 5 km·h -1 , 5% incline, 100% LOP). Phase 3 
examined the magnitude and effect of blood volume distribution following BFR 
treadmill walking using a modified CO-rebreathe technique.
RESULTS: Cardiac ejection fraction remained stable irrespective of cuff pressure 
and despite a reduction in end-diastolic volume (Δ of 11 ± 9 mL, P = 0.02). HR 
and BP were highest at 100% LOP (ΔHR = 18 ± 19 bpm, ΔSBP = 51 ± 30 mm Hg, ΔDBP = 
33 ± 15 mm Hg, ΔRate Pressure Product = 76 ± 32 bpm·mm Hg·100 -1 ). BFR 
treadmill walking stimulated a greater release of fluid-regulating hormones than 
normal walking (Δrenin = BFR: 25.3 ± 24.2 vs CON: 9.1 ± 11.8 ng·L -1 ; Δcopeptin 
= BFR: 50.1 ± 97.9 vs. CON: 0.43 ± 0.8 pmol·L -1 ), but no difference in fluid 
retention was observed ( P = 0.2). Approximately 27% of total blood volume was 
confined to the legs during BFR, but the relative volume trapped in the legs was 
not related to fluid-regulating hormone release (renin r = -0.04, P = 0.9; 
copeptin r = 0.27, P = 0.3).
CONCLUSIONS: BFR exercise elicits the largest cardiovascular effect using 100% 
LOP, with evidence of appreciable fluid regulating hormonal response during a 
typical BFR exercise session. The relative volume of blood sequestered in the 
limb does not appear to drive this response.

BACKGROUND: Walking impairments are a common consequence of neurological 
disorders and are assessed with clinical scores that suffer from several 
limitations. Robot-assisted locomotor training is becoming an established 
clinical practice. Besides training, these devices could be used for assessing 
walking ability in a controlled environment. Here, we propose an adaptive 
assist-as-needed (AAN) control for a treadmill-based robotic exoskeleton, the 
Lokomat, that reduces the support of the device (body weight support and 
impedance of the robotic joints) based on the ability of the patient to follow a 
gait pattern displayed on screen. We hypothesize that the converged values of 
robotic support provide valid and reliable information about individuals' 
walking ability.
METHODS: Fifteen participants with spinal cord injury and twelve controls used 
the AAN software in the Lokomat twice within a week and were assessed using 
clinical scores (10MWT, TUG). We used a regression method to identify the 
robotic measure that could provide the most relevant information about walking 
ability and determined the test-retest reliability. We also checked whether this 
result could be extrapolated to non-ambulatory and to unimpaired subjects.
RESULTS: The AAN controller could be used in patients with different injury 
severity levels. A linear model based on one variable (robotic knee stiffness at 
terminal swing) could explain 74% of the variance in the 10MWT and 61% in the 
TUG in ambulatory patients and showed good relative reliability but poor 
absolute reliability. Adding the variable 'maximum hip flexor torque' to the 
model increased the explained variance above 85%. This did not extend to 
non-ambulatory nor to able-bodied individuals, where variables related to stance 
phase and to push-off phase seem more relevant.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel AAN software for the Lokomat can be used to quantify the 
support required by a patient while performing robotic gait training. The 
adaptive software might enable more challenging training conditions tuned to the 
ability of the individuals. While the current implementation is not ready for 
assessment in clinical practice, we could demonstrate that this approach is 
safe, and it could be integrated as assist-as-needed training, rather than as 
assessment.

Out-toeing gait may cause alterations in lower limb biomechanics that could lead 
to an increased risk of overuse injuries. Surgery and physical therapy are 
conventional methods for mitigating such gait, but they are costly and 
time-consuming. Wearable devices like braces and orthoses are used as affordable 
alternatives, but they apply non-negligible stress on the skin. Haptic 
feedback-delivering shoes were also recently developed, but they require 
actuators and power sources. The purpose of our study is to develop compression 
tights with inward directing taping lines that apply compression to lower limb 
muscles and segments to facilitate inward rotation of the foot, overcoming the 
drawbacks of previous methods. These compression tights were manufactured to fit 
the average height, leg length, hip girth, and waist girth of South Korean 
females in their twenties. The efficacy of these compression tights was 
evaluated by comparing walking kinematics and user satisfaction of 12 female 
dancers with an out-toeing gait under three conditions: wearing tights with 
taping lines, tights without taping lines, and basic bicycle shorts. The foot 
rotation angles and joint kinematics were recorded using a pressure-pad 
treadmill and motion capture system, respectively. Multiple pairwise comparisons 
revealed that the compression tights with inward-directing lines significantly 
reduced foot rotation angles (up to an average of 20.1%) compared with the 
bicycle shorts (p = 0.002 and 0.001 for dominant and non-dominant foot, 
respectively) or the compression tights without taping lines (p = 0.005 and p = 
0.001 for dominant and non-dominant foot, respectively). Statistical parametric 
mapping revealed significant main effects of the tight type on joint kinematics. 
Also, t-tests revealed that the participants reported significantly higher 
ratings of perceived functionality and usability on the compression tights with 
inward-directing taping lines. In conclusion, we developed a comfortable and 
practical apparel-type wearable and demonstrated its short-term efficacy in 
mitigating out-toeing gait.

runners across different speeds.

Sport), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China.

This study aims to determine the validity of the lower extremity joint 
kinematics measured by inertial measurement units (IMUs) in non-rearfoot strike 
pattern (NRFS) runners across different speeds. Fifteen NRFS runners completed 
three 2-min running tests on a treadmill in random order at 8, 10 and 12 km/h, 
whilst data were synchronously collected using the IMU system and an optical 
motion capture system. Before the offset was corrected, the validity of the knee 
angle waveform was higher than that of the hip and ankle; after the offset was 
corrected, the validity increased in all three joints. The correlation between 
the touchdown angles in the sagittal plane measured by the two systems was 
relatively high after the offset was corrected. The running speed influenced the 
offset-corrected measurements, with higher error values at higher speeds. The 
IMU system was able to provide measurements of running kinematics in the 
sagittal plane of NRFS runners at different running speeds but was unable to 
reliably measure motion in the frontal and horizontal planes. Future research 
should analyse the 3D gait of NRFS runners under a larger range of speed 
conditions to provide evidentiary support for the use of IMUs in running 
analysis outside the laboratory.

IMPORTANCE: Few people with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) 
participate in supervised treadmill exercise covered by the Center for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services. In people with PAD, the benefits of home-based walking 
exercise, relative to supervised exercise, remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To study whether home-based walking exercise improves 6-minute walk 
(6MW) more than supervised treadmill exercise in people with PAD (defined as 
Ankle Brachial Index ≤0.90).
DATA SOURCES: Data were combined from 5 randomized clinical trials of exercise 
therapy for PAD using individual participant data meta-analyses, published from 
2009 to 2022.
STUDY SELECTION: Of the 5 clinical trials, 3 clinical trials compared supervised 
treadmill exercise to nonexercise control (N = 370) and 2 clinical trials 
compared an effective home-based walking exercise intervention to nonexercise 
control (N = 349).
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Individual participant-level data from 5 
randomized clinical trials led by 1 investigative team were combined. The 5 
randomized clinical trials included 3 clinical trials of supervised treadmill 
exercise and 2 effective home-based walking exercise interventions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in 6MW distance, maximum treadmill walking 
distance, and Walking Impairment Questionnaire at 6-month follow-up. The 
supervised treadmill exercise intervention consisted of treadmill exercise in 
the presence of an exercise physiologist, conducted 3 days weekly for up to 50 
minutes per session. Home-based walking exercise consisted of a behavioral 
intervention in which a coach helped participants walk for exercise in or around 
home for up to 5 days per week for 50 minutes per session.
RESULTS: A total of 719 participants with PAD (mean [SD] age, 68.8 [9.5] years; 
46.5% female) were included (349 in a home-based exercise clinical trial and 370 
in a supervised exercise trial). Compared with nonexercise control, supervised 
treadmill exercise was associated with significantly improved 6MW by 32.9 m (95% 
CI, 20.6-45.6; P < .001) and home-based walking exercise was associated with 
significantly improved 6MW by 50.7 m (95% CI, 34.8-66.7; P < .001). Compared 
with supervised treadmill exercise, home-based walking exercise was associated 
with significantly greater improvement in 6MW distance (between-group 
difference: 23.8 m [95% CI, 3.6, 44.0; P = .02]) but significantly less 
improvement in maximum treadmill walking distance (between-group 
difference:-132.5 m [95% CI, -192.9 to -72.1; P < .001]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this individual participant data meta-analyses, 
compared with supervised exercise, home-based walking exercise was associated 
with greater improvement in 6MW in people with PAD. These findings support 
home-based walking exercise as a first-line therapy for walking limitations in 
PAD.

The use of body weight support (BWS) can reveal important insights into the 
relationship between lower-limb muscle activities and the ventilatory response 
during sinusoidal walking. Here, healthy participants (n = 15) walked on a 
treadmill while 0%, 30%, and 50% of their body weight was supported with BWS. 
The walking speed was varied sinusoidally between 3 and 6 km h-1, and three 
different frequencies, and periods ranging from 2 to 10 min were used. 
Breath-by-breath ventilation ([Formula: see text]) and CO2 output ([Formula: see 
text]) were measured. The tibialis anterior (TA) muscle activity was measured by 
electromyography throughout the walking. The amplitude (Amp), normalized Amp 
[Amp ratio (%)], and phase shift (PS) of the sinusoidal variations in 
measurement variables were calculated using a Fourier analysis. The results 
revealed that the Amp ratio in [Formula: see text] increased with the increase 
in BWS. A steeper slope of the [Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] 
relationship and greater [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text] values were 
observed under reduced body weight conditions. The Amp ratio in TA muscle was 
significantly positively associated with the Amp ratio in the [Formula: see 
text] (p < 0.001). These findings indicate that the greater amplitude in the TA 
muscle under BWS may have been a potent stimulus for the greater response of 
ventilation during sinusoidal walking.

Visual Occlusions Result in Phase Synchrony Within Multiple Brain Regions 
Involved in Sensory Processing and Balance Control.

Symeonidou ER, Ferris DP.

There is a need to develop appropriate balance training interventions to 
minimize the risk of falls. Recently, we found that intermittent visual 
occlusions can substantially improve the effectiveness and retention of balance 
beam walking practice (Symeonidou & Ferris, 2022). We sought to determine how 
the intermittent visual occlusions affect electrocortical activity during beam 
walking. We hypothesized that areas involved in sensorimotor processing and 
balance control would demonstrate spectral power changes and inter-trial 
coherence modulations after loss and restoration of vision. Ten healthy young 
adults practiced walking on a treadmill-mounted balance beam while wearing 
high-density EEG and experiencing reoccurring visual occlusions. Results 
revealed spectral power fluctuations and inter-trial coherence changes in the 
visual, occipital, temporal, and sensorimotor cortex as well as the posterior 
parietal cortex and the anterior cingulate. We observed a prolonged alpha 
increase in the occipital, temporal, sensorimotor, and posterior parietal cortex 
after the occlusion onset. In contrast, the anterior cingulate showed a strong 
alpha and theta increase after the occlusion offset. We observed transient phase 
synchrony in the alpha, theta, and beta bands within the sensory, posterior 
parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices immediately after occlusion onset and 
offset. Intermittent visual occlusions induced electrocortical spectral power 
and inter-trial coherence changes in a wide range of frequencies within cortical 
areas relevant for multisensory integration and processing as well as balance 
control. Our training intervention could be implemented in senior and 
rehabilitation centers, improving the quality of life of elderly and 
neurologically impaired individuals.

The mechanical and metabolic responses of walking by obese children are not yet 
well understood. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare the pendular 
mechanism (recovery, phase shift by α and β values, and ratio between forward 
and vertical mechanical work), the maximum possible elastic energy usage and the 
bilateral coordination during walking between non-obese and obese children, and 
(2) to verify if the bilateral coordination could contribute to understanding 
the pendular mechanism and elastic energy usage in these populations. Nine obese 
(six female, 8.7 ± 0.5 years, 1.38 ± 0.04 m, 44.4 ± 6.3 kg and 24.1 ± 3.50 kg/m2 
) and eight non-obese (four female, 7.4 ± 0.5 years, 1.31 ± 0.08 m, 
26.6 ± 2.1 kg and 16.4 ± 1.40 kg/m2 ) children were analysed during walking on a 
treadmill at five speeds: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 km/h. The results indicated that 
although the mechanical energy response of the centre of mass during walking is 
similar between obese and non-obese children, the obese children showed a lower 
pendulum-like mechanism and greater elastic energy usage during level walking. 
Therefore, obese children seem to use more elastic energy during walking 
compared to non-obese children, which may be related to their apparent higher 
positive work production during the double support phase. Finally, bilateral 
coordination presented high values at slow speeds in both groups and requires 
further attention due to its association with falls. NEW FINDINGS: What is the 
central question of this study? Are there any differences of the pendular and 
elastic mechanisms and bilateral coordination during walking between non-obese 
and obese children? What is the main finding and its importance? To our 
knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the mechanical energy usage and 
the bilateral coordination of obese and non-obese children during walking. Obese 
children had a lower pendular recovery mechanism and used more elastic energy 
compared to non-obese children. The bilateral coordination was higher at slow 
speeds in both groups and requires further attention due to its association with 
falls.

BACKGROUND This study aimed to compare the ankle-brachial index (ABI), maximal 
claudication distance (MCD), pain-free walking distance (PFWD), claudication 
pain, and quality of life (intermittent claudication questionnaire [ICQ]) before 
and 3 months after revascularization surgery in 98 patients diagnosed with 
peripheral arterial disease (PAD) at a single center in Poland. MATERIAL AND 
METHODS Ninety-eight patients were examined (77% men, 23% women, 65.65±7.27 
years old), diagnosed with PAD, and qualified for revascularization. The 
diagnosis of PAD was made on the basis of ABI ≤0.9 and medical records. The 
patients underwent a noninvasive examination, including measurement of ABI (by 
Doppler with the EZ8 probe), assessment of the quality of life by ICQ, distance 
of intermittent claudication on a treadmill using the Gardner-Skinner protocol 
(including PFWD and MCD), and pain intensity during walking (numeric rating 
scale [NRS11]). The assessment was carried out twice: 1 to 5 days before surgery 
and 3 months after surgery. RESULTS There was an increase of ABI (0.4 vs 0.62, 
P<0.001), PFWD (26.64 vs 80.21, P<0.001), MCD (60.08 vs 181.85, P<0.001), and 
ICQ (79.92 vs 60.23, P<0.001) and reduction of PFWD pain (7.26 vs 6.05, P<0.001) 
and MCD pain (9.24 vs 8.11, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Revascularization surgery 
improved the ABI and patients functional efficiency expressed in the improvement 
of subjective indicators PFWD, MCD, NRS11, and ICQ. Patients who had a longer 
duration of disease had worse outcomes after revascularization. More attention 
should be paid to increasing access to preventive examinations aimed at early 
detection of PAD and the possibility of implementing conservative treatment.

People use vision to inform motor control strategies during walking. With 
practice performing a target stepping task, people shift their gaze farther 
ahead, transitioning from watching their feet contact the target to looking for 
future target locations. The shift in gaze focus suggests the role of vision in 
motor control changes from emphasizing feedback to feedforward control. The 
present study examines whether changing visual fixation location is accompanied 
by a similar change in reliance upon visual information. Twenty healthy young 
adults practiced stepping on moving targets projected on the surface of a 
treadmill. Periodically, participants' visual reliance was probed by hiding 
stepping targets which inform feedback or feedforward (targets < or > 1.5 steps 
ahead, respectively) motor control strategies. We calculated visual reliance as 
the increase in step error when targets were hidden. We hypothesized that with 
practice, participant reliance on feedback visual information would decrease and 
their reliance on feedforward visual information would increase. Contrary to our 
hypothesis, participants became significantly more reliant on feedback visual 
information with practice (p < 0.001) but their reliance on feedforward visual 
information did not change (p = 0.49). Participants' reliance on visual 
information increased despite looking significantly farther ahead with practice 
(p < 0.016). Together, these results suggest that participants fixated on 
feedback information less. However, changes in fixation pattern did not reduce 
their reliance upon feedback information as stepping performance still 
significantly decreased when feedback information was removed after training. 
These findings provide important context for how the role of vision in 
controlling walking changes with practice.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neuromotor diseases that develops 
as a result of damage to the developing central nervous system during the 
perinatal period. The condition is usually accompanied by musculoskeletal 
problems resulting in movement disorders. Gait improvement therefore, is an 
important part of its treatment. Roboticassisted gait training (RAGT) is a new 
potential rehabilitation tool for CP patients, however there is no clear 
evidence for the effectiveness of this method.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Can robotic-assisted gait training improve walking function 
in children with CP?
METHODS: A systematic search was performed in five databases: MEDLINE (via 
PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, 
Scopus, and Web of Science. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials 
(RCT) with CP patients under the age of 18. Gross motor function and kinematic 
gait parameters of patients were the main outcomes. Two authors determined the 
risk of bias of the RCTs independently using the revised Risk of Bias 2 (ROB 2) 
tool. Mean Differences (MDs) along with their 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were 
calculated when at least three studies were present for an outcome, subgroup 
analysis was performed based on the treatment of the control group.
RESULTS: Of the 7363 screened articles, 13 papers met our inclusion criteria and 
among them, 7 studies could be used in our meta-analyses. The results related to 
RAGT suggest nonsignificant improvement in standing and walking function (Gross 
Motor Function Measure D, E), moreover changes in gait speed, step length, and 
in cadence were also only comparable to controls.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results indicate that there is a trend in some gait parameters 
where the improvement was higher in the intervention group than in control 
group. The therapeutic effect of RAGT was probably not superior to physiotherapy 
combined with treadmill training.

BACKGROUND: Successful recovery following a perturbation during walking depends 
on a quick well-coordinated response from the body. As such, lower limb joint 
power and work provide critical information characterizing the success of the 
recovery after a perturbation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate 
lower-limb joint power and the relative contribution of each joint to the total 
leg work during the recovery following a trip-induced perturbation.
METHODS: Twenty-four young male volunteers walked at 1.1 m/s for 2 min, followed 
by two unexpected perturbations induced by rapidly decelerating the right belt 
of the split-belt treadmill. Joint moments and powers were calculated using an 
inverse dynamic approach. Joint work was found as the integral of joint power 
with respect to time. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and paired-sample 
t-tests were used to compare joint power and work between recovery and 
unperturbed steps.
RESULTS: Compared to normal walking, recovery from the trip required a 
significant increase in both positive (+27 %, p < 0.05) and negative(+28 
%,p < 0.05) leg work. During unperturbed walking, the ankle was the key 
contributor to both positive (ankle=50 %, hip=34 %, and knee=15 %) and negative 
(ankle=62 %, knee=32 %, and hip=6 %) leg work. During recovery, the knee 
eccentric work significantly increased (+83 %,p < 0.05) making it the main 
contributor to the negative leg work (knee=46 %, ankle=45 %, and hip=9 %). The 
hip positive work also increased during recovery (+62.7 %, p < 0.05), while 
ankle and the knee positive work remained unchanged.
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings highlight the importance of eccentric work of the 
knee, and concentric work of the hip joint during recovery from trip-induced 
perturbations. The additional mechanical demand of producing and absorbing more 
power during recovery is primarily imposed on the knee and hip, rather than the 
ankle. This new insight into the specific functions of lower-limb joints during 
recovery from trip-induced perturbations has important implications for the 
design of targeted fall prevention interventions.

When humans walk, it is important for them to have some measure of the distance 
they have traveled. Typically, many cues from different modalities are 
available, as humans perceive both the environment around them (for example, 
through vision and haptics) and their own walking. Here, we investigate the 
contribution of visual cues and nonvisual self-motion cues to distance 
reproduction when walking on a treadmill through a virtual environment by 
separately manipulating the speed of a treadmill belt and of the virtual 
environment. Using mobile eye tracking, we also investigate how our participants 
sampled the visual information through gaze. We show that, as predicted, both 
modalities affected how participants (N = 28) reproduced a distance. 
Participants weighed nonvisual self-motion cues more strongly than visual cues, 
corresponding also to their respective reliabilities, but with some 
interindividual variability. Those who looked more toward those parts of the 
visual scene that contained cues to speed and distance tended also to weigh 
visual information more strongly, although this correlation was nonsignificant, 
and participants generally directed their gaze toward visually informative areas 
of the scene less than expected. As measured by motion capture, participants 
adjusted their gait patterns to the treadmill speed but not to walked distance. 
In sum, we show in a naturalistic virtual environment how humans use different 
sensory modalities when reproducing distances and how the use of these cues 
differs between participants and depends on information sampling.NEW & 
NOTEWORTHY Combining virtual reality with treadmill walking, we measured the 
relative importance of visual cues and nonvisual self-motion cues for distance 
reproduction. Participants used both cues but put more weight on self-motion; 
weight on visual cues had a trend to correlate with looking at visually 
informative areas. Participants overshot distances, especially when self-motion 
was slow; they adjusted steps to self-motion cues but not to visual cues. Our 
work thus quantifies the multimodal contributions to distance reproduction.

PURPOSE: Running at a given speed can be achieved by taking large steps at a low 
frequency or on the contrary by taking small steps at a high frequency. The 
consequences of a change in step frequency, at a fixed speed, affects the 
stiffness of the lower limb differently. In this study, we compared the running 
mechanics and kinematics at different imposed step frequencies (from 2 step s-1 
to 3.6 step s-1) to understand the relationship between kinematic and kinetic 
parameters.
METHODS: Eight recreational male runners ran on a treadmill at 5 different 
speeds and 5 different step frequencies. The lower-limb segment motion and the 
ground reaction forces were recorded. Mechanical powers, general gait 
parameters, lower-limb movements and coordination were investigated.
RESULTS: At low step frequencies, in order to limit the magnitude of the ground 
reaction force, the vertical stiffness is reduced and thus runners deviate from 
an elastic rebound. At high step frequencies, the stiffness is increased and the 
elastic rebound is optimised in its ability to absorb and restore energy during 
the contact phase.
CONCLUSION: We studied the consequences of a change in step frequency on the 
bouncing mechanics of running. We showed that the lower limb stiffness and the 
intersegmental coordination of the lower-limb segments are affected by running 
step frequency rather than speed. The runner rather adapts their lower limb 
stiffness to match a step frequency for a given speed than the opposite.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics and symptoms of patients with hip 
osteoarthritis that are associated with spatiotemporal gait parameters, 
including their variability and asymmetry.
DESIGN: A retrospective, cross-sectional study.
SETTING: University hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: The study analyzed the gait analysis data of 155 patients (N=155) 
with hip osteoarthritis who were admitted to a university hospital for total hip 
replacement and were able to walk on a treadmill without a handrail.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The dependent variables were gait parameters during 
treadmill walking. These included gait speed, stride length, cadence, 
coefficient of variation of stride length and stride time, swing time symmetry 
index, and step symmetry index. Single and multiple regression analyses were 
conducted using independent variables of the characteristics and symptoms of the 
patients, including age, sex, height, pain, leg-length discrepancy, and muscle 
strength of the affected and normal sides measured with a hand-held dynamometer 
(iliopsoas, gluteus medius, and quadriceps).
RESULTS: In the analysis, gait speed and stride were the dependent variables, 
whereas age, height, and muscle strength on the affected side were the 
significant independent variables (P<.05). Additionally, pain demonstrated a 
marginal association with gait speed (P=.053). Only the leg-length discrepancy 
correlated with cadence. When the coefficient of variation of the stride length 
was the dependent variable, age and muscle strength on the affected side were 
significant. For the swing time symmetry index, only the muscle strength on the 
affected side was significant. Furthermore, the step symmetry index only 
correlated with leg-length discrepancy. The muscle strength on the affected side 
was the only significant independent variable for the coefficient of variation 
of the stride time.
CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that each of the frequent clinical symptoms of 
hip osteoarthritis, such as pain, muscle weakness, and leg-length discrepancy, 
can explain different aspects of gait performance.

OBJECTIVE: Video-based pose estimation is an emerging technology that shows 
significant promise for improving clinical gait analysis by enabling 
quantitative movement analysis with little costs of money, time, or effort. The 
objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of pose estimation-based 
gait analysis when video recordings are constrained to 3 common clinical or 
in-home settings (ie, frontal and sagittal views of overground walking and 
sagittal views of treadmill walking).
METHODS: Simultaneous video and motion capture recordings were collected from 30 
persons after stroke during overground and treadmill walking. Spatiotemporal and 
kinematic gait parameters were calculated from videos using an open-source human 
pose estimation algorithm and from motion capture data using traditional gait 
analysis. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were then used to assess the 
accuracy of the pose estimation-based gait analysis across the different 
settings, and the authors examined Pearson and intraclass correlations with 
ground-truth motion capture data.
RESULTS: Sagittal videos of overground and treadmill walking led to more 
accurate measurements of spatiotemporal gait parameters versus frontal videos of 
overground walking. Sagittal videos of overground walking resulted in the 
strongest correlations between video-based and motion capture measurements of 
lower extremity joint kinematics. Video-based measurements of hip and knee 
kinematics showed stronger correlations with motion capture versus ankle 
kinematics for both overground and treadmill walking.
CONCLUSION: Video-based gait analysis using pose estimation provides accurate 
measurements of step length, step time, and hip and knee kinematics during 
overground and treadmill walking in persons after stroke. Generally, sagittal 
videos of overground gait provide the most accurate results.
IMPACT: Many clinicians lack access to expensive gait analysis tools that can 
help identify patient-specific gait deviations and guide therapy decisions. 
These findings show that video-based methods that require only common household 
devices provide accurate measurements of a variety of gait parameters in persons 
after stroke and could make quantitative gait analysis significantly more 
accessible.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effects of wearing high-heeled 
shoes (HHS) on gait variability of the lower limbs when the treadmill speed was 
sinusoidally changed.
METHODS: A total of 17 young females walked on a treadmill with HHS, HHS with 
detachable base sockets (HHS-Sockets), and low-heeled shoes (LHS) under 
sinusoidal speed-changing protocol of 60-s and 30-s periods with an amplitude of 
± 0.56 m·s-1. The time course of the joint elevation angles of the thigh, shank, 
and foot in one gait cycle can be well approximated like a plane in a triaxial 
space, so-called intersegmental coordination (IC). Standard deviation of the 
plane (IC thickness) was considered as the anteroposterior gait variability when 
the best-fitting plane of the angular covariation was obtained. The lateral gait 
variability was the coefficient of variance of step width (CVSW). To examine 
whether the gait parameters was associated with IC thickness, a sum of the time 
delay of the stride length and step frequency (TDSL+SF) against sinusoidal speed 
change was calculated.
RESULTS: The IC thickness was not different across shoe conditions and periods. 
The CVSW was greater in the HHS and HHS-Sockets conditions than in the LHS 
condition. TDSL+SF was greater in the HHS condition than in the LHS and 
HHS-Sockets conditions at both periods; however, it was not correlated with IC 
thickness.
SIGNIFICANCE: Walking with HHS increased lateral gait variability at faster 
speed-changing situation, but not anteroposterior gait variability. Detachable 
sockets expanding the base area ten times greater than that of HHS could reduce 
TDSL+SF; however, TDSL+SF could not explain the IC thickness.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess how needing to listen and 
remember information while walking affects speech perception, memory task 
performance, and gait in younger and middle-aged adults.
METHOD: Four gait parameters (stride duration, step variability, whole-body 
center of mass acceleration, and mediolateral head acceleration) were measured 
when younger and middle-aged participants stood or walked on a treadmill while 
they simultaneously completed a speech-on-speech perception task and a preload 
memory task, singly and in combination.
RESULTS: Speech perception was significantly poorer for middle-aged than for 
younger participants. Performance on the speech perception measure did not 
differ significantly between walking and standing for either group of 
participants, but the additional cognitive load of the memory task reduced 
performance on the speech perception task. Memory task performance was 
significantly poorer when combined with the speech perception task than when 
measured in isolation for both participant groups, but no further declines were 
noted when participants were also walking. Mediolateral head acceleration, which 
has been linked to loss of balance, was significantly greater during multitask 
trials, as compared to when participants were only walking without being 
required to listen or remember. Post hoc analysis showed that dual- and 
multitask influences on mediolateral head acceleration were more prominent for 
middle-aged than for younger participants. Stride duration was longer in the 
multitask condition than when participants were only walking.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this exploratory study indicate that gait may be 
impacted when individuals (both younger and middle-aged) are listening and 
remembering while walking. Data also substantiate prior findings of early 
age-related declines in the perception of speech in the presence of 
understandable speech maskers.

Heat acclimatization or acclimation training in horses is practiced to reduce 
physiological strain and improve exercise performance in the heat, which can 
involve metabolic improvement in skeletal muscle. However, there is limited 
information concerning the acute signaling responses of equine skeletal muscle 
after exercise in a hot environment. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the hypothesis that exercise in hot conditions induces greater 
changes in heat shock proteins and mitochondrial-related signaling in equine 
skeletal muscle compared with exercise in cool conditions. Fifteen trained 
Thoroughbred horses [4.6 ± 0.4 (mean ± SE) years old; 503 ± 14 kg] were assigned 
to perform a treadmill exercise test in cool conditions [COOL; Wet Bulb Globe 
Temperature (WBGT), 12.5°C; n = 8] or hot conditions (HOT; WBGT, 29.5°C; n = 7) 
consisting of walking at 1.7 m/s for 1 min, trotting at 4 m/s for 5 min, and 
cantering at 7 m/s for 2 min and at 90% of VO2max for 2 min, followed by walking 
at 1.7 m/s for 20 min. Heart rate during exercise and plasma lactate 
concentration immediately after exercise were measured. Biopsy samples were 
obtained from the middle gluteal muscle before and at 4 h after exercise, and 
relative quantitative analysis of mRNA expression using real-time RT-PCR was 
performed. Data were analyzed with using mixed models. There were no significant 
differences between the two groups in peak heart rate (COOL, 213 ± 3 bpm; HOT, 
214 ± 4 bpm; p = 0.782) and plasma lactate concentration (COOL, 
13.1 ± 1.4 mmoL/L; HOT, 17.5 ± 1.7 mmoL/L; p = 0.060), while HSP-70 (COOL, 
1.9-fold, p = 0.207; HOT, 2.4-fold, p = 0.045), PGC-1α (COOL, 3.8-fold, 
p = 0.424; HOT, 8.4-fold, p = 0.010), HIF-1α (COOL, 1.6-fold, p = 0.315; HOT, 
2.2-fold, p = 0.018) and PDK4 (COOL, 7.6-fold, p = 0.412; HOT, 14.1-fold, 
p = 0.047) mRNA increased significantly only in HOT at 4 h after exercise. These 
data indicate that acute exercise in a hot environment facilitates protective 
response to heat stress (HSP-70), mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α and HIF-1α) 
and fatty acid oxidation (PDK4).

The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of radial extracorporeal shock 
wave therapy (rESWT) and conventional physical therapy (CPT) protocol on the 
gait pattern in stroke survivors through a new gait analysis technology. Fifteen 
(n=15) stroke survivors took part in this prospective, observational study and 
were assessed clinically and through an instrumented treadmill before and after 
rESWT and CPT. Spasticity grade 95% CI 0.93 (0.79 +/- 1.08), pain intensity 95% 
CI 1.60 (1.19 +/- 2.01), and clonus score decreased significantly 95% CI 1.13 
(0.72 +/- 1.54). The sensorimotor function 95% CI -2.53 (-3.42 +/- 1.65), 
balance 95% CI -5.67 (-6.64 +/- - 4.69), and gait parameters were enhanced at 
the end of the program. Step length 95% CI -3.47 (-6.48 +/- 0.46) and step cycle 
were improved 95% CI -0.09 (-0.17 +/- -0.01), and hip 95% CI -3.90 (-6.92 +/- 
-0.88), knee 95% CI -2.08 (-3.84 +/- -0.32) and ankle flexion-extension 95% CI 
-2.08 (-6.64 +/- -4.69) were augmented. Adding the quantitative analysis to the 
clinical assessment, we gained easy access to track progress and obtained an 
individualized therapeutic approach for stroke survivors.

Conflict of interest statement: We confirm that we have read the Journal’s 
position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report 
is consistent with those guidelines. Stroke is one of the leading causes of 
long-term disability in adults worldwide with an increasing number of persons 
affected by this condition. Stroke related impairments such as spasticity, 
muscle weakness, pain, sensorimotor deficits, and poor balance can often lead to 
a decreased tolerance to daily life activities, autonomy restriction, and 
sedentary lifestyle., Gait is a complex task and parameters such as 
spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic variables are often modified in patients 
with walking disorders. Currently, new technological gait analysis systems offer 
the possibility of creating a database, reproducible results, and easy access 
for tracking progress and efficacy of neurorehabilitation programs through 
telerehabilitation (TR) implementation in the clinical practice, especially 
since the COVID-19 pandemic context., Quantitative gait analysis systems include 
instrumented treadmills as a new alternative to previous overground gait 
analysis systems, and also promote the assessments and effective therapeutic 
delivery of care to neurological patients after discharge.,, Objective, 
quantitative parameters are needed to ensure good quality in clinical practice 
since the most commonly used methods for gait analysis were based either on 
visual observation or questionnaires, which are considered poorly reliable and 
insufficient methods. Currently, the gold standard for measuring and evaluating 
spatiotemporal and kinematic gait parameters is represented by various 3D motion 
capture systems., Poor balance control and gait impairments interfere with 
standing and walking ability in stroke survivors. Gait dynamics changes its 
pattern especially in stroke survivors due to increased muscle tone and balance 
impairment. Early detection and assessment of gait anomalies through gait 
analysis systems evaluate stride length and duration, lower limb range of motion 
(ROM), limb symmetry or asymmetry, providing objective parameters and ensuring 
evaluation of progress and recovery during the rehabilitation program. Usually, 
the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients is a long-term process involving 
multiple assessments. However, during the pandemic of COVID-19, the access to 
healthcare delivery throughout the world has been significantly impacted 
creating collateral damages for both, rehabilitation facilities and stroke 
survivors. One of the key changes implemented by the health care systems in 
order to promote rehabilitation continuity, was the rapid expansion of several 
TR programs and tele-assessments strategies., Systems such as newly instrumented 
treadmills for spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic parameters assessment with 
good levels of agreement, seem a new alternative to previous overground gait 
analysis systems. Integrating clinical assessment and virtual evaluation can 
easily offer objective data by tracking progress and also give the possibility 
to a tailored treatment for patients based on their performance at different 
moments. Among the emerging therapies, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) 
is a non-invasive therapeutic intervention used for musculoskeletal disorders, 
several inflammatory tendon diseases, or spasticity. The findings suggest that 
ESWT may be useful in decreasing plantar flexor muscle tone for adults and 
children affected by lower limb spasticity., There are some trials which had 
also showed that radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy (rESWT) was more 
effective on augmenting the ankle passive range of motion (PROM) compared to 
focal extracorporeal shockwave therapy (fESWT)., In addition, ESWT proved to be 
effective not only as treatment for lower limb spasticity, but also for gait 
pattern since combined with a conventional physical therapy (CPT) program 
decreased spasticity and improved gait pattern in children with hemiplegic 
cerebral palsy (CP). The findings on ESWT effectiveness for gait pattern 
improvement could open a new paradigm applicable for the research of this 
promising, non-invasive therapy already effective for spasticity management. 
Added to clinical evaluation, the instrumented treadmills serve both as a tool 
for gait training and also for recording and measuring spatiotemporal and 
kinematic parameters, offering objective data for gait analysis, especially 
after treatment delivery., Gait analysis through systems such as instrumented 
treadmills play an important role in clinical practice and clinical trials by 
assessing gait patterns related to various disorders. This type of analysis 
through instrumented treadmills is based on measurements which offer the 
possibility for repeatability. Through the inertial measurement units (IMUs) 
usage it is granted good validity and reliability for mean spatiotemporal 
parameters during gait phases. Although there are trials validating different 
types of 3D cameras for gait analysis on the treadmills and overground, only few 
of them assessed the instrumented treadmills. However, there are gait analysis 
systems which showed good levels of agreement, and added to the clinical 
assessment provide the assessor with objective, real-time data.,, Therefore, the 
aim of this study is to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of rESWT and CPT 
protocol on the gait pattern in stroke survivors through a new gait analysis 
technology. This type of technology encompasses spatiotemporal and kinematic 
parameters, and the findings are correlated with the clinical evaluation, 
offering a global assessment of gait parameters."

INTRODUCTION: Perturbation-based balance training (PBT) targets the mechanism of 
falls (eg, slipping, tripping) to specifically train the recovery actions needed 
to avoid a fall. This task-specific training has shown great promise as an 
effective and efficient intervention for fall prevention in older adults. 
However, knowledge about the dose-response relationship of PBT, as well as its 
feasibility and acceptability in older adults with increased risk of falling is 
still limited. Thus, the aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of 
two different treadmill PBT protocols for improving reactive balance control in 
fall-prone older adults, and to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of 
these protocols.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is designed as a pilot randomised controlled 
trial with a 6-week intervention and 6-week follow-up period. Thirty-six 
community-dwelling, fall-prone (Timed Up and Go >12 s, habitual gait speed <1.0 
m/s and/or fall history) older adults will be randomised (1:1) to receive six 
(weeks 1-6) or two treadmill PBT sessions (weeks 1+6) plus four conventional 
treadmill training sessions (weeks 2-5). Training sessions are conducted 1×/week 
for 30 min. Each PBT will include 40 perturbations in anterior-posterior and 
mediolateral directions. Reactive balance after perturbations in standing 
(Stepping Threshold Test (STT)) and walking (Dynamic Stepping Threshold Test 
(DSTT)) will be assessed as the primary outcome for effectiveness. Secondary 
outcomes are spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters collected during STT, DSTT 
and PBT, maximum perturbation magnitude for each PBT session, static and dynamic 
balance, physical capacity, physical activity, concerns with falling and 
executive functions. Feasibility will be assessed via training adherence, 
drop-out rate, perturbations actually performed and adverse events; and 
acceptability via self-designed questionnaire and focus groups.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of 
the Medical Faculty Heidelberg (S-602/2022). Findings will be disseminated 
through publications in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

Previous research has shown that there are differences in mechanical energy, 
kinematics, and muscle activation when comparing walking on level and incline 
surfaces, especially on inclines above 15%. Muscle activations are significantly 
different while walking on extreme inclines, suggesting a different coordination 
pattern. We utilized continuous relative phase to assess walking kinematic 
coordination with respect to increased incline angles. Twelve healthy, 
college-aged individuals walked for 7 inclines of 1 minute each on a motorized 
treadmill at 3 mph at 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% inclines. Kinematic 
data were collected during the last 20 seconds of each stage (120 Hz). Segmental 
and joint angles and angular velocities in the sagittal plane were calculated, 
from which continuous relative phase was determined for 3 joint couples: 
hip-knee, hip-ankle, and knee-ankle. There were significant differences in the 
coordination patterns during the first part of the contact phase in the hip-knee 
and hip-ankle couplings between the 0% and 30% inclines, with all 3 joint 
couplings becoming more in-phase at inclines above 15%. Importantly, the 
hip-knee coupling changed significantly from more out-of-phase to more in-phase 
between 10% and 15% incline. Shifting lower-extremity joint coordination in 
response to extreme inclines identifies potential coordinative strategies to 
achieve steep walking.

Introduction: Under plantar loading regimes, it is accepted that both pressure 
and shear strain biomechanically contribute to formation and deterioration of 
diabetic foot ulceration (DFU). Plantar foot strain characteristics in the 
at-risk diabetic foot are little researched due to lack of measurement devices. 
Plantar pressure comparatively, is widely quantified and used in the 
characterisation of diabetic foot ulceration risk, with a range of clinically 
implemented pressure measurement devices on the market. With the development of 
novel strain quantification methods in its infancy, feasibility testing and 
validation of these measurement devices for use is required. Initial studies 
centre on normal walking speed, reflecting common activities of daily living, 
but evaluating response to differing gait loading regimes is needed to support 
the use of such technologies for potential clinical translation. This study 
evaluates the effects of speed and inclination on stance time, strain location 
and strain response using a low-cost novel strain measurement insole. Methods: 
The STrain Analysis and Mapping of the Plantar Aspect (STAMPS) insole has been 
developed, and feasibility tested under self-selected normal walking speeds to 
characterise plantar foot strain, with testing beyond this limited regime 
required. A treadmill was implemented to standardise speed and inclination for a 
range of daily plantar loading conditions. A small cohort, comprising of five 
non-diabetic participants, were examined at slow (0.75 m/s), normal (1.25 m/s) 
and brisk (2 m/s) walking speeds and normal speed at inclination (10% gradient). 
Results: Plantar strain active regions were seen to increase with increasing 
speed across all participants. With inclination, it was seen that strain active 
regions reduce in the hindfoot and show a tendency to forefoot with 
discretionary changes to strain seen. Stance time decreases with increasing 
speed, as expected, with reduced stance time with inclination. Discussion: 
Comparison of the strain response and stance time should be considered when 
evaluating foot biomechanics in diabetic populations to assess strain time 
interval effects. This study supports the evaluation of the STAMPS insole to 
successfully track strain changes under differing plantar loading conditions and 
warrants further investigation of healthy and diabetic cohorts to assess the 
implications for use as a risk assessment tool for DFU.

We investigated whether an impediment to progress in understanding the 
environmental factors that cause falls may be the difficulty in comparing 
results across studies because walking surfaces are poorly defined and 
underspecified. We conducted a systematic review of 384 studies from 370 
articles that tested how different surfaces influenced human walking and 
falling. For each study, we report which categories of surfaces were used 
(indoor, outdoor, treadmill, virtual reality and qualitative), the nature of 
each surface (stairs, slopes, slippery, compliant, rough or default) and how 
information about each surface was measured. We found that minimal information 
was provided for many surfaces, making it impossible to meaningfully compare 
results for different types of surfaces across studies. We conclude that most 
published studies of walking and falling provide insufficient data to describe 
the surfaces that they used and we provide recommendations about how to improve 
the reporting of walking surfaces.

BACKGROUND: Sensory deficits in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) play a 
critical role in balance control. However, there is a lack of effective 
interventions that address sensory facilitation to improve walking balance. 
Stochastic Resonance (SR) stimulation involves delivering sub threshold noise to 
improve balance in patients with sensory deficits by enhancing the detection of 
sensory input.
RESEARCH QUESTION: To investigate the immediate effects of SR on walking balance 
in individuals with and without CP.
METHODS: Thirty-four participants (17 CP, 17 age-and sex-matched typically 
developing controls or TD) between 8 and 24 years of age were recruited. SR 
stimulation was applied to the muscles and ligaments of ankle and hip joint. An 
optimal SR intensity during walking was determined for each subject. 
Participants walked on a self-paced treadmill for three trials of two minutes 
each using a random order of SR stimulation (SR) and no stimulation (noSR) 
control conditions. Our primary outcome measure was minimum lateral margin of 
stability (MOS). Secondary outcome measures include anterior MOS before 
heelstrike and spatiotemporal gait parameters. We performed two-way mixed ANOVAs 
with group (CP, TD) as between-subject and condition (noSR, SR) as within 
subject factors.
RESULTS: Compared to walking without SR, there was a small but significant 
increase in the lateral and anterior MOS with SR stimulation, implying that a 
larger impulse was needed to become unstable, in turn implying higher stability. 
Step width and step ength decreased with SR for the CP group with SR 
stimulation. There were no significant effects for other spatiotemporal 
variables.
SIGNIFICANCE: Sub threshold electrical noise can slightly improve walking 
balance control in individuals with CP. SR stimulation, through enhanced 
proprioception, may have improved the CP group's awareness of body motion during 
walking, thus leading them to adopt a more conservative stability strategy to 
prevent a potential fall.

BACKGROUND: Most falls in older persons occur during walking and are often due 
to maladaptation in response to gait perturbations. Therefore, the assessment of 
reactive dynamic balance is highly relevant for determining the individual risk 
of falling and could enable an early initiation of interventions.
OBJECTIVE: The methods available for perturbation of gait and for evaluating the 
corresponding reaction patterns are critically discussed in order to approach 
the assessment of reactive dynamic balance.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A diagnostic protocol for perturbation of gait on 
a treadmill was developed based on the literature. The application of the 
protocol to map reactive dynamic balance as comprehensively as possible is 
presented.
RESULTS: After the initial determination of the individually preferred gait 
speed over ~ 6 min, the participant's gait is disrupted with 9 different types 
of perturbations over a time period of ~ 4:30 min. The evaluation options 
include spatiotemporal parameters and their variability, the margin of stability 
and the Lyapunov exponent.
CONCLUSION: Dynamic reactive balance is a promising and specific parameter for 
quantifying the risk of falling in older persons. The comprehensive evaluation 
of the documented parameters is currently insufficient because there are no 
established methods or references. The development of a unified method for the 
sensitive determination of reactive dynamic balance is essential for its use in 
assessment of the risk of falling in the clinical context and for measuring the 
success of training.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Die meisten Stürze älterer Personen 
finden während des Gehens statt; oftmals liegen ihnen fehlerhafte Reaktionen auf 
Störungen des Gangs zugrunde. Die Erfassung des reaktiven dynamischen 
Gleichgewichts hat eine hohe Relevanz für die Bestimmung des individuellen 
Sturzrisikos und könnte frühzeitig eine Initiierung von Interventionen 
ermöglichen. ZIEL: Verfügbare Methoden zur Perturbation des Gangs sowie zur 
Auswertung der entsprechenden Reaktionsmuster werden kritisch diskutiert, um 
sich der Bewertung des reaktiven dynamischen Gleichgewichts anzunähern.
MATERIAL UND METHODEN: Basierend auf Literatur wird ein Protokoll für die 
Perturbation des Gangs auf einem Laufband vorgestellt und eine Möglichkeit 
präsentiert, das reaktive dynamische Gleichgewicht möglichst umfassend 
abzubilden.
ERGEBNISSE: Nach initialer Ermittlung der präferierten Gehgeschwindigkeit über 
~6 min werden die Proband:innen über ~4:30 min mithilfe von 9 verschiedenen 
Perturbationen in ihrem Gang gestört. Die Auswertemöglichkeiten umfassen sowohl 
spatiotemporale Parameter als auch deren Variabilität sowie die „margin of 
stability“ und den Lyapunov-Exponenten.
DISKUSSION: Das reaktive dynamische Gleichgewicht ist ein vielversprechender, 
spezifischer Parameter zur Quantifizierung des Sturzrisikos älterer Personen. 
Die umfassende Bewertung erhobener Parameter ist derzeit unzureichend, da es 
keine etablierten Methoden oder Referenzen gibt. Die Entwicklung eines 
einheitlichen Verfahrens zur sensitiven Bestimmung des reaktiven dynamischen 
Gleichgewichts ist essenziell, um diese für die Bewertung des Sturzrisikos im 
klinischen Kontext einzusetzen und um Trainingserfolge nutzen zu können.

University, Changwon, South Korea.

BACKGROUND: The 8-figure shoulder brace during treadmill training (8-FSBTT) 
intervention can stabilize the shoulder joint, improve the upright of the 
thoracic spine, induces a change in the angle of the arm during walking, and 
consequently improve walking ability in stroke patients.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to compare the effects of a 4-week program of 
8-FSBTT with those of only treadmill training (OT) on arm swing angle, and gait 
parameters (gait speed, cadence, and both side stride lengths) in chronic stroke 
patients.
METHODS: Participants were randomized to either the 8-FSBTT (n = 11) or OT 
(n = 11) group. Patients in both groups underwent standard physiotherapy for 30 
min per session. In addition, 8-FSBTT and OT interventions were performed 10 
min, 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Arm swing angle, gait speed, cadence, and 
both side stride lengths were measured after 4 weeks of training.
RESULTS: After 4 weeks of training, the 8-FSBTT group showed significant 
improvement in all outcome measures compared with baseline (p < 0.05). 
Furthermore, Arm swing angle, gait speed, cadence, and both side stride lengths 
showed greater improvement in the 8-FSBTT group compared to the OT group 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that 8-FSBTT training, combined with 
standard physiotherapy, improved Arm swing angle, gait speed, cadence, and both 
side stride lengths in the chronic stroke patients.

Using load-suspended backpacks to reduce vertical peak dynamic load exerted on 
humans can reduce metabolic costs. However, is it possible to further reduce 
metabolic cost by modulating dynamic load phase shift? If so, is anti-phase 
better than the others? In this study, we investigated the biomechanics, 
energetics and trunk response under phase shifts. Nine subjects wearing an 
active backpack with 19.4 kg loads walked on a treadmill at 5 km h-1 with four 
phase shift trials (T1-T4) and a load-locked trial (LK). Our results show that 
anti-phase trial (T3) assists ankle more and reduces the moment and 
gastrocnemius medialis activity, while T4 assists knee more and reduces the 
moment and rectus femoris activity. Due to the load injecting more mechanical 
energy into human in T3 and T4, the positive centre-of-mass work is 
significantly reduced. However, the gross metabolic rate is lowest in T4 and 
4.43% lower than in T2, which may be because the activations of erector spinae 
and gluteus maximus are reduced in T4. In addition, T3 increases trunk extensor 
effort, which may weaken the metabolic advantage. This study provides guidance 
for improving assistance strategies and human-load interfaces and deepens the 
understanding of the energetics and biomechanics of human loaded walking.

The relationship between individual muscle dynamics and whole-body metabolic 
cost is not well established. Here we use biofeedback to modulate triceps surae 
(TS) activity during walking to test the following hypotheses based on basic 
principles of muscle physiology: (1) increased TS activity would increase 
metabolic cost via shorter muscle fascicle lengths and thus reduced force 
capacity and (2) decreased TS activity would decrease metabolic cost via longer 
muscle fascicle lengths and thus increased force capacity. 23 young adults 
walked on an instrumented treadmill at 1.25 m/s using electromyographic (EMG) 
biofeedback to match targets corresponding to ±20 and ±40% TS activity during 
push-off (late stance). B-mode ultrasound imaged the medial gastrocnemius (MG). 
Participants increased net metabolic power up to 85% and 21% when targeting 
increased and decreased TS activity, respectively (p < 0.001). At the instant of 
peak gastrocnemius force, MG fascicle length was 7% shorter (p < 0.001) and 
gastrocnemius force was 6% larger (p < 0.001) when targeting + 40% TS activity. 
Fascicle length was 3% shorter (p = 0.004) and force was 7% lower (p = 0.010) 
when targeting -40% TS activity; participants were unable to achieve decreased 
activation targets. MG fascicle length and activity mediated 11.7% (p = 0.036) 
and 57.2% (p = 0.006) of the changes in net metabolic power, respectively. MG 
force did not mediate changes in net metabolic power (p = 0.948). These findings 
suggest that changes in the functional operating length of muscle, induced here 
by volitional changes in TS activity, mediated changes in the metabolic cost of 
walking, relatively independently of force. Thus, shifts to shorter fascicle 
lengths (e.g., aging) may mediate activity-induced increases in metabolic cost.

Ankle-Foot-Orthosis ""Hermes"" Compensates Pathological Ankle Stiffness of Chronic 
Stroke-A Proof of Concept.

Rodriguez Hernandez KE, De Groot JH, Baas F, Stijntjes M, Grootendorst-Heemskerk 
ERM, Schiemanck SK, van der Helm FCT, van der Kooij H, Mugge W.

Individuals with an upper motor neuron syndrome, e.g., stroke survivors, may 
have a pathological increase of passive ankle stiffness due to spasticity, that 
impairs ankle function and activities such as walking. To improve mobility, 
walking aids such as ankle-foot orthoses and orthopaedic shoes are prescribed. 
However, these walking aids generally limit the range of motion (ROM) of the 
foot and may therewith negatively influence activities that require a larger 
ROM. Here we present a new ankle-foot orthosis ""Hermes"", and its first 
experimental results from four hemiparetic chronic stroke patients. Hermes was 
designed to facilitate active ankle dorsiflexion by mechanically compensating 
the passive ankle stiffness using a negative-stiffness mechanism. Four levels of 
the Hermes' stiffness compensation (0%, 35%, 70% and 100%) were applied to 
evaluate active ROM in a robotic ankle manipulator and to test walking 
feasibility on an instrumented treadmill, in a single session. The robotic tests 
showed that Hermes successfully compensated the ankle joint stiffness in all 
four patients and improved the active dorsiflexion ROM in three patients. Three 
patients were able to walk with Hermes at one or more Hermes' stiffness 
compensation levels and without reducing their preferred walking speeds compared 
to those with their own walking aids. Despite a small sample size, the results 
show that Hermes holds great promise to support voluntary ankle function and to 
benefit walking and daily activities.

BACKGROUND: Exercise priming, pairing high intensity exercise with a motor 
learning task, improves retention of upper extremity tasks in individuals after 
stroke, but has shown no benefit to locomotor learning. This difference may 
relate to the type of learning studied. Upper extremity studies used explicit, 
strategic tasks; locomotor studies used implicit sensorimotor adaptation 
(split-belt treadmill). Since walking is an important rehabilitation goal, it is 
crucial to understand under which circumstances exercise priming may improve 
retention of a newly learned walking pattern.
OBJECTIVE: Determine the impact of exercise priming on explicit, strategic 
locomotor learning task retention in chronic stroke survivors.
METHODS: Chronic stroke survivors (>6 months) performed 2 treadmill walking 
sessions. Visual feedback was used to train increased step length. Participants 
were assigned to control group (no exercise), continuous exercise (5 minutes 
high intensity), or long-interval exercise (15 minutes high/moderate intervals). 
After day 1 learning, participants either rested or performed exercise. On day 
2, retention of the learned walking pattern was tested.
RESULTS: All groups learned on day 1 (P < .001). The 2 priming groups showed 
significant changes in blood lactate and heart rate after exercise priming, the 
resting control group did not (P < .001). On day 2, there was no significant 
between-group difference in cued or un-cued task retention (P = .963 and .287, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise priming did not affect retention of an explicit locomotor 
task in chronic stroke survivors. Further work should explore subgroups of 
individuals for whom priming may have selective clinical benefit to locomotor 
learning.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03726047.

Age-specific walking speed during locomotor adaptation leads to more 
generalization across contexts.

Previous work has shown that compared with young adults, older adults generalize 
their walking patterns more across environments that impose different motor 
demands (i.e., split-belt treadmill vs. overground). However, in this previous 
study, all participants walked at a speed that was more comfortable for older 
adults than young participants, which leads to the question of whether young 
adults would generalize more their walking patterns than older adults when 
exposed to faster speeds that are more comfortable for them. To address this 
question, we examined the interaction between healthy aging and walking speed on 
the generalization of a pattern learned on a split-belt treadmill (i.e., legs 
moving at different speeds) to overground. We hypothesized that walking speed 
during split-belt walking regulates the generalization of walking patterns in an 
age-specific manner. To this end, groups of young (<30 y/o) and older (65+ y/o) 
adults adapted their gait on a split-belt treadmill at either slower or faster 
walking speeds. We assessed the generalization of movements between the groups 
by quantifying their aftereffects during overground walking, where larger 
overground aftereffects represent more generalization, and zero aftereffects 
represent no generalization. We found an interaction between age and walking 
speed in the generalization of walking patterns. More specifically, older adults 
generalized more when adapted at slower speeds, whereas younger adults did so 
when adapted at faster speeds. These results suggest that comfortable walking 
speeds lead to more generalization of newly acquired motor patterns beyond the 
training contexts.

METHODS: In a single-blind randomized clinical trial, we randomly assigned 91 
patients with CNSLBP into CFT (n = 45) and MSI-based treatment (n = 46) groups. 
An 8-week training intervention was given to both groups. The researchers 
measured the primary outcome, which was pain intensity (Numeric rating scale), 
and the secondary outcomes, including disability (Oswestry disability index), 
Kinesiophobia (Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale), and vertical ground reaction force 
(VGRF) parameters at self-selected and faster speed (Force distributor 
treadmill). We evaluated patients at baseline, at the end of the 8-week 
intervention (post-treatment), and six months after the first treatment. We used 
mixed-model ANOVA to evaluate the effects of the interaction between time 
(baseline vs. post-treatment vs. six-month follow-up) and group (CFT vs. 
MSI-based treatment) on each measure.
RESULTS: CFT showed superiority over MSI-based treatment in reducing pain 
intensity (P < 0.001, Effect size (ES) = 2.41), ODI (P < 0.001, ES = 2.15), and 
Kinesiophobia (P < 0.001, ES = 2.47) at eight weeks. The CFT also produced 
greater improvement in VGRF parameters, at both self-selected (FPF[P < 0.001, 
ES = 3], SPF[P < 0.001, ES = 0.5], MSF[P < 0.001, ES = 0.67], WAR[P < 0.001, 
ES = 1.53], POR[P < 0.001, ES = 0.8]), and faster speed, FPF(P < 0.001, 
ES = 1.33, MSF(P < 0.001, ES = 0.57), WAR(P < 0.001, ES = 0.67), POR(P < 0.001, 
ES = 2.91)] than the MSI, except SPF(P < 0.001, ES = 0.0) at eight weeks.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the CFT is associated with better results 
in clinical and cognitive characteristics than the MSI-based treatment for 
CNSLBP, and the researchers maintained the treatment effects at six-month 
follow-up. Also, This study achieved better improvements in gait kinetics in 
CFT. CTF seems to be an appropriate and applicable treatment in clinical 
setting.

OBJECTIVE: To compare, rank and evaluate the 24 exercise types that improve 
postural instability in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
METHODS: We searched the data in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane 
library, and Web of Science from their inception date to January 23, 2023. 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that aimed at determining the effectiveness 
of physical activity interventions on postural instability in adults with PD. 
This review focused on different balance outcome categories: (a) balance test 
batteries (BBS); (b) static steady-state balance (sSSB); (c) dynamic 
steady-state balance (dSSB); (d) proactive balance (PB); (e) reactive balance 
(RB).
RESULTS: Among 10,474 records, 199 studies (patients = 9523) were eligible for 
qualitative synthesis. The random-effects NMA model revealed that the following 
exercise training modalities had the highest p score of being best when compared 
with control group: body-weight support treadmill training (BWS_TT) for BBS (p 
score = 0.97; pooled standardised mean difference (95% CI): 1.56 (0.72 to 2.39)) 
and dSSB (1.00; 1.53 (1.07 to 2.00)), aquatic exercise (AQE) for sSSB (0.85; 
0.94 (0.33 to 1.54)), Pilates for PB (0.95; 1.42 (0.59 to 2.26)). Balance and 
gait training with the external cue or attention (BGT_ECA) and robotic assisted 
gait balance (RA_GT) had similar superior effects in improving RB. The 
confidence in evidence was often low according to Confidence in Network 
Meta-Analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: There is low quality evidence that BWS_TT, AQE, Pilates, BGT_ECA 
and RA_GT are possibly the most effective treatments, pending outcome of 
interest, for adults with PD.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy (HMSN) are 
commonly provided with orthopedic footwear to improve gait. Although orthopedic 
footwear has shown to improve walking speed and spatiotemporal parameters, its 
effect on gait adaptability has not been established.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect of orthopedic footwear on gait 
adaptability in individuals with HMSN?
METHODS: Fifteen individuals with HMSN performed a precision stepping task on an 
instrumented treadmill projecting visual targets, while wearing either 
custom-made orthopedic or standardized footwear (i.e. minimally supportive, 
flexible sneakers). Primary measure of gait adaptability was the absolute 
Euclidean distance [mm] between the target center and the middle of the foot 
(absolute error). Secondary outcomes included the relative and variable error 
[mm] in both anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions. Dynamic 
balance was assessed by the prediction of ML foot placement based on the ML 
center of mass position and velocity, using linear regression. Dynamic balance 
was primarily determined by foot placement deviation in terms of root mean 
square error. Another aspect of dynamic balance was foot placement adherence in 
terms of the coefficient of determination (R2). Differences between the footwear 
conditions were analyzed with a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test 
(α = 0.05).
RESULTS: The absolute error, relative error (AP) and variable error (AP and ML) 
decreased with orthopedic footwear, whereas the relative error in ML-direction 
slightly increased. As for dynamic balance, no effect on foot placement 
deviation or adherence was found.
SIGNIFICANCE: Gait adaptability improved with orthopedic compared to 
standardized footwear in people with HMSN, as indicated by improved precision 
stepping. Dynamic balance, as a possible underlying mechanism, was not affected 
by orthopedic footwear.

AIM: We analyzed the biomechanical response (joint angles, moments, and powers) 
to running with added leg mass. These data may help guide the design of wearable 
locomotor assistive devices (i.e., exoskeletons), which are becoming more 
prevalent.
METHODS: 15 participants (7 females, 8 males) completed treadmill running trials 
(3m•s-1) normally and with lead mass (300-1350 g) attached to the thigh, shank, 
or foot, bilaterally. We quantified the lower limb biomechanics combining motion 
capture and ground reaction force data using standard inverse dynamics analysis.
RESULTS: Only moderate kinematic changes occurred in response to the distal 
added limb mass. Maximum hip flexion and maximum knee flexion angles during 
swing phase increased by approximately 9% and 6% respectively for each 1 kg 
added to each foot. However, adding even small masses made dramatic changes to 
the joint moments and powers, mostly during the swing phase. For example, adding 
1 kg to each foot increased maximum joint moments by as much as 40% (knee 
extension in late swing) and maximum joint power by as much as 50% (hip 
generation in late swing).
CONCLUSION: Leg joint kinematics were largely conserved in response to adding 
mass to the legs. Adding mass to the leg distally increased joint power mainly 
at the knee and hip joints during the swing phase, whereas adding mass 
proximally mainly affected the ankle joint mechanics during the stance phase. 
These changes have implications for shoe designs, people who run with added mass 
on their legs for sport/strength training and for the design of wearable 
devices.

The potential impact of a specific physical activity program on biomechanical 
gait parameters and neuromuscular strategies around the ankle joint in older 
adults with sarcopenic obesity (SO) remains largely unexplored. The objective of 
this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a 24-week posture, 
strengthening, and motricity (PSM) program on improving neuromuscular strategies 
and biomechanical gait parameters in older adults with SO. 40 participants were 
randomly assigned to either the trained group (TG) and the control group (CG). 
Only the TG received the PSM program. Standardized evaluations were performed 
before and after the intervention, including walking tests on an instrumented 
gait analysis treadmill to evaluate biomechanical gait parameters and EMG 
activity of ankle muscles. After the PSM program, TG exhibited an increase in 
comfortable walking speed (+80%, p < 0.001) and step length (+38%, p < 0.05). 
Moreover, TG demonstrated a reduction in CoP velocity (-26%, p < 0.01). These 
gait modifications were associated with decreased muscle activity during the 
different gait phases (p < 0.05). The PSM program effectively improved gait and 
neuromuscular capacities in older adults with SO. Notably, these results shed 
light on the remarkable trainability of neuromuscular capacities in older adults 
with SO, despite the adverse effects of aging and obesity.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of the moderate 
1-km treadmill walking test (1km-TWT) to predict changes in peak oxygen uptake 
(V˙O 2peak ) in patients with stable cardiovascular disease (CVD) during an 
exercise-based secondary prevention program.
METHODS: Sixty-four male outpatients with stable CVD (age 64 [41-85] yr) 
performed the 1km-TWT before and after an 8-wk walking training program. Patient 
V˙O 2peak was estimated using a sex-specific equation including age, body mass 
index, 1km-TWT performance time, and heart rate (V˙O 2peakEST ). Forty-one 
patients completed a maximal cardiopulmonary treadmill test (CPX) for direct V˙O 
2peak determination (V˙O 2peakMEAS ). The training prescription consisted of 
moderate-to-high intensity supervised walking for 30-40 min/session, and an 
additional 2-4 times/wk of unsupervised home moderate walking sessions between 
20-60 min at the end of the program. The walking intensity was based on the 
results of the 1km-TWT.
RESULTS: Patients participated in an average of 14 of the 16 supervised 
sessions. An overall significant improvement in V˙O 2peakMEAS and weekly 
recreational physical activity levels were observed. No differences were 
observed between V˙O 2peakMEAS and V˙O 2peakEST . Compared with CPX results, the 
1km-TWT underestimated the V˙O 2peak increase after the exercise intervention 
(mean difference -0.3 mL/kg/min, P > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: The 1km-TWT provides a reasonably accurate and simple tool to 
predict changes in V˙O 2peak due to moderate walking training in male 
outpatients with CVD. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence 
supporting the use of the 1km-TWT for exercise testing and training purposes in 
the context of cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs.

Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Germany.

The clinical sign of ataxia is related to several neurological diseases and is 
seen in conjunction with paresis in dogs with spinal cord injury (SCI). 
Endeavours to objectify canine spinal ataxia in SCI remain limited. The aim of 
this clinical study was to determine and quantify differences between gait 
characteristics of ataxic dogs with thoracolumbar myelopathy and healthy control 
dogs using a computer-and treadmill-based gait analysis system. Five dogs with 
spinal ataxia and six healthy dogs underwent video-and computer-assisted gait 
analysis while walking on a four-ground reaction force plate treadmill system 
(maximum speed of 0.7 m/s). Spatio-temporal and kinetic gait characteristics 
regarding the dogs' locomotion were analysed with a focus on the individual 
coefficient of variation (CV), as a potential measure for quantification of the 
level of ataxia. Ataxic dogs with thoracolumbar SCI showed no effect on symmetry 
indices but higher variability in spatio-temporal and kinetic gait parameters 
mainly in the pelvic, but also in the thoracic limbs. Double support phase of 
the individual limb was prolonged in SCI dogs at the cost of the single support 
and swing phase. Reduced peaks of ground reaction forces (GRF) could potentially 
be explained by reduction of muscle strength, as a strategy of avoiding falling 
by taking enthusiastic steps, or by alteration of the rhythmogenic spinal 
circuits between the pelvic and thoracic limb pattern generators.

Low-Grade Inflammatory Mediators and Metalloproteinases Yield Synchronous and 
Delayed Responses to Mechanical Joint Loading.

OBJECTIVE: Mechanical loading is an essential factor for the maintenance of 
joint inflammatory homeostasis and the sensitive catabolic-anabolic signaling 
cascade involved in maintaining cartilage tissue health. However, abnormal 
mechanical loading of the joint structural tissues can propagate joint metabolic 
dysfunction in the form of low-grade inflammation. To date, few studies have 
attempted to delineate the early cascade responsible for the initiation and 
perpetuation of stress-mediated inflammation and cartilage breakdown in human 
joints.
DESIGN: Fifteen healthy human male participants performed a walking paradigm on 
a cross-tilting treadmill platform. Blood samples were collected before 
exercise, after 30 minutes of flat walking, after 30 minutes of tilted walking, 
and after an hour of rest. Serum concentrations of the following biomarkers were 
measured: interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-α, 
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-13, transforming growth 
factor beta (TGF)-β, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP)-1, 
and cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP).
RESULTS: Luminex Multiplex analysis of serum showed increased concentrations of 
COMP, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10, and TGF-β from samples collected after flat and 
cross-tilted treadmill walking compared to baseline. Serum concentrations of 
MMP-1 and MMP-13 also increased, but primarily in samples collected after tilted 
walking. Pearson's correlation analysis showed positive correlations between the 
expression of COMP, TNF-α, IL-10, and MMP-13 at each study timepoint.
CONCLUSION: Stress-mediated increases in serum COMP during exercise are 
associated with acute changes in pro and anti-inflammatory molecular activity 
and subsequent changes in molecules linked to joint tissue remodeling and 
repair.

BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity in people with chronic stroke profoundly affects 
daily function and increases recurrent stroke risk and mortality, making 
physical activity improvements an important target of intervention. We compared 
the effects of a highintensity walking intervention (FAST), a step activity 
monitoring behavioral intervention (SAM), or a combined intervention (FAST+SAM) 
on physical activity (i.e., steps per day). We hypothesized the combined 
intervention would yield the greatest increase in steps per day.
METHODS: This assessor-blinded multi-site randomized controlled trial was 
conducted at four university/hospital-based laboratories. Participants were 
21-85 years old, walking without physical assistance following a single, 
unilateral non-cerebellar stroke of ≥6 months duration, and randomly assigned to 
FAST, SAM, or FAST+SAM for 12 weeks (2-3 sessions/week). FAST training consisted 
of walking-related activities for 40 minutes/session at 70-80% heart rate 
reserve, while SAM received daily feedback and goal-setting of walking activity 
(steps per day). Assessors and study statistician were masked to group 
assignment.The a priori-determined primary outcome and primary endpoint was 
change in steps per day from pre- to post-intervention. Adverse events (AEs) 
were tracked after randomization. All randomized participants were included in 
the intent-to-treat analysis.This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT02835313.
FINDINGS: Participants were enrolled from July 18, 2016-November 16, 2021. Of 
250 randomized participants (mean[SE] age 63[0.80], 116F/134M), 89 were assigned 
to FAST, 81 to SAM, and 80 to FAST+SAM. Steps per day significantly increased in 
both the SAM (mean[SE] 1542[267], 95%CI:1014-2069, p<0.001) and FAST+SAM groups 
(1307[280], 752-1861, p<0.001), but not in the FAST group (406[238], 63-876, 
p=0.09). There were no deaths or serious study-related AEs and all other minor 
AEs were similar between groups.
INTERPRETATION: Only individuals with chronic stroke who completed a step 
activity monitoring behavioral intervention with skilled coaching and goal 
progression demonstrated improvements in physical activity (steps per day).

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is one of the most frequently reported symptoms 
in patients with non-central nervous system (non-CNS) cancer. Walking has 
positive effects on cognitive function. However, the effects of walking 
interventions on cognitive function outcomes in patients with non-CNS cancer are 
not well synthesized.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the characteristics of walking 
intervention and its effects on cognitive function in patients with non-CNS 
cancer.
METHODS: Ten databases were searched to identify eligible randomized controlled 
trials from each database's inception to June 7, 2021. The Physiotherapy 
Evidence Database Scale was used to assess the quality of the included studies.
RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials involving 242 adults with non-CNS 
cancer were included. Two studies involving immediate treadmill walking 
interventions with moderate intensity at 40% to 60% maximal heart rate reported 
significantly improved objective cognitive domains of processing speed and 
spatial working memory with small to moderate effect sizes for cancer survivors. 
One study delivering home-based, moderate-intensity walking intervention had 
borderline significantly positive effects on perceived cognitive functioning for 
patients with non-CNS cancer during chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Walking intervention with moderate intensity is a beneficial 
approach to improve objective cognitive domains of processing speed and spatial 
working memory and perceived cognitive function.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses may provide moderate-intensity walking with 
40% to 60% maximal heart rate monitoring to alleviate cognitive problems during 
the continuous process of cancer care. The modality and dosage of intervention 
should be adjusted depending on this population's tolerance to better maintain 
training.

Motor control, including locomotion, strongly depends on the gravitational 
field. Recent developments such as lower-body positive pressure treadmills 
(LBPPT) have enabled studies on Earth about the effects of reduced body weight 
(BW) on walking and running, up to 60% BW. The present experiment was set up to 
further investigate adaptations to a more naturalistic simulated hypogravity, 
mimicking a Martian environment with additional visual information during 
running sessions on LBPPT. Twenty-nine participants performed three sessions of 
four successive five-min runs at preferred speed, alternating Earth- or 
simulated Mars-like gravity (100% vs. 38% BW). They were displayed visual scenes 
using a virtual reality headset to assess the effects of coherent visual flow 
while running. Running performance was characterized by normal ground reaction 
force and pelvic accelerations. The perceived upright and vection 
(visually-induced self-motion sensation)in dynamic visual environments were also 
investigated at the end of the different sessions. We found that BW reduction 
induced biomechanical adaptations independently of the visual context. Active 
peak force and stance time decreased, while flight time increased. Strong 
inter-individual differences in braking and push-off times appeared at 38% BW, 
which were not systematically observed in our previous studies at 80% and 60% 
BW. Additionally, the importance given to dynamic visual cues in the perceived 
upright diminished at 38% BW, suggesting an increased reliance on the egocentric 
body axis as a reference for verticality when the visual context is fully 
coherent with the previous locomotor activity. Also, while vection was found to 
decrease in case of a coherent visuomotor coupling at 100% BW (i.e., 
post-exposure influence), it remained unaffected by the visual context at 38% 
BW. Overall, our findings suggested that locomotor and perceptual adaptations 
were not similarly impacted, depending on the -simulated- gravity condition and 
visual context.

BACKGROUND: Exercise training performed at maximal fat oxidation (FATmax) is an 
efficient non-pharmacological approach for the management of obesity and its 
related cardio-metabolic disorders.
OBJECTIVES: Therefore, this work aimed to provide exercise intensity guidelines 
and training volume recommendations for maximizing fat oxidation in patients 
with obesity.
METHODS: A systematic review of original articles published in English, Spanish 
or French languages was carried out in EBSCOhost, PubMed and Scopus by strictly 
following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) statement. Those studies that analyzed maximal fat oxidation (MFO) and 
FATmax in patients with obesity (body fat > 25% for men; > 35% for women) by 
calculating substrate oxidation rates through indirect calorimetry during a 
graded exercise test with short-duration stages (< 10 min) were selected for 
quantitative analysis. The accuracy of relative oxygen uptake (% peak oxygen 
uptake [%[Formula: see text]O2peak]) and relative heart rate (% peak heart rate 
[%HRpeak]) for establishing FATmax reference values was investigated by 
analyzing their intra-individual and inter-study variation. Moreover, cluster 
analysis and meta-regression were used for determining the influence of 
biological factors and methodological procedures on MFO and FATmax.
RESULTS: Sixty-four manuscripts were selected from 146 records; 23 studies only 
recruited men (n = 465), 14 studies only evaluated women (n = 575), and 27 
studies included individuals from both sexes (n = 6434). The majority of the 
evaluated subjects were middle-aged adults (aged 40-60 y; 84%) with a poor 
cardiorespiratory fitness (≤ 43 mL·kg-1·min-1; 81%), and the reported MFO ranged 
from 0.27 to 0.33 g·min-1. The relative heart rate at FATmax (coefficient of 
variation [CV]: 8.8%) showed a lower intra-individual variation compared with 
relative oxygen uptake (CV: 17.2%). Furthermore, blood lactate levels at FATmax 
ranged from 1.3 to 2.7 mmol·L-1 while the speed and power output at FATmax 
fluctuated from 4 to 5.1 km·h-1 and 42.8-60.2 watts, respectively. Age, body 
mass index, cardiorespiratory fitness, FATmax, the type of ergometer and the 
stoichiometric equation used to calculate the MFO independently explained MFO 
values (R2 = 0.85; p < 0.01). The MFO in adolescents was superior in comparison 
with MFO observed in young and middle-aged adults. On the other hand, the MFO 
was higher during treadmill walking in comparison with stationary cycling. Body 
fat and MFO alone determined 29% of the variation in FATmax (p < 0.01), noting 
that individuals with body fat > 35% showed a heart rate of 61-66% HRpeak while 
individuals with < 35% body fat showed a heart rate between 57 and 64% HRpeak. 
Neither biological sex nor the analytical procedure for computing the fat 
oxidation kinetics were associated with MFO and FATmax.
CONCLUSION: Relative heart rate rather than relative oxygen uptake should be 
used for establishing FATmax reference values in patients with obesity. A heart 
rate of 61-66% HRpeak should be recommended to patients with > 35% body fat 
while a heart rate of 57-64% HRpeak should be recommended to patients with body 
fat < 35%. Moreover, training volume must be higher in adults to achieve a 
similar fat oxidation compared with adolescents whereas exercising on a 
treadmill requires a lower training volume to achieve significant fat oxidation 
in comparison with stationary cycling.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of acute mood 
modulation on treadmill walking duration during experimental pain application.
METHODS: This was a repeated measure, within-subject study design. 30 healthy 
individuals (Males: Females 16:14; age 22.9 ± 2.5 years; height 170.9 ± 9.5 cm; 
body mass 68.4 ± 14.6 kg) attended a familiarization session and three 
experimental sessions, whereby they simultaneously viewed emotionally evoking 
stimulus from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and performed 
two treadmill walking tests (maximum 10 min duration) with a fixed nociceptive 
input applied to the thigh (pressure cuff). The primary outcome was treadmill 
walking duration during pain application to achieve a fixed pain score. During 
walking, mood (Self-Assessment Manikin: SAM 0-9) and pain (numerical rating 
scale: NRS 0-10) were measured.
RESULTS: Mood valence scores were significantly different in all conditions 
(p < 0.001), negative (2.4 ± 0.3), neutral (4.9 ± 0.6) and positive (6.6 ± 0.3). 
There was a significant difference (p = 0.04) in the treadmill walking duration 
for different mood states. For the primary outcome, post hoc analysis found 
differences between the negative and positive mood conditions for the treadmill 
walking durations to reach pain scores of 3 (negative: 224 ± 49 s; positive: 
259 ± 60s, effect size [ES]: 0.80), 4 (negative: 262 ± 59 s; positive: 
326 ± 90s, ES: 0.92), 5 (negative: 313 ± 86 s; positive: 385 ± 113 s, ES: 0.90), 
6 (negative: 367 ± 106 s; positive: 447 ± 113 s, ES: 1.04) and 7 (negative: 
423 ± 114 s; positive: 521 ± 110 s, ES: 1.02). There was no significant 
difference in the treadmill walking duration between the neutral vs negative 
mood and neutral vs positive mood conditions.
CONCLUSION: These results highlight the potential psychophysiological impacts on 
the pain experience in healthy individuals and encourages pursuit in strategies 
to minimize pain-limited exercise, a highly prevalent issue in the chronic pain 
population.
SIGNIFICANCE: Walking-based rehabilitation, designed to improve physical 
activity, has been shown to improve pain and disability. However active 
participation and adherence in walking-based rehabilitation has shown to be 
jeopardized by pain and pain-related cognitive and behavioural adaptations. This 
study examined the effect of a shift in mood on pain perception and treadmill 
walking tolerance. We found that with a worse mood, individuals were less 
tolerant of pain and walked on the treadmill for a shorter duration. These 
results suggest that factors which improve mood should be combined with 
walking-based training to improve tolerance.

Joint moment measurements represent an objective biomechemical parameter in 
joint health assessment. Inverse dynamics based on 3D motion capture data is the 
current 'gold standard' to estimate joint moments. Recently, machine learning 
combined with data measured by wearable technologies such electromyography 
(EMG), inertial measurement units (IMU), and electrogoniometers (GON) has been 
used to enable fast, easy, and low-cost measurements of joint moments. This 
study investigates the ability of various deep neural networks to predict lower 
limb joint moments merely from IMU sensors. The performance of five different 
deep neural networks (InceptionTimePlus, eXplainable convolutional neural 
network (XCM), XCMplus, Recurrent neural network (RNNplus), and Time Series 
Transformer (TSTPlus)) were tested to predict hip, knee, ankle, and subtalar 
moments using acceleration and gyroscope measurements of four IMU sensors at the 
trunk, thigh, shank, and foot. Multiple locomotion modes were considered 
including level-ground walking, treadmill walking, stair ascent, stair descent, 
ramp ascent, and ramp descent. We show that XCM can accurately predict lower 
limb joint moments using data of only four IMUs with RMSE of 0.046 ± 0.013 Nm/kg 
compared to 0.064 ± 0.003 Nm/kg on average for the other architectures. We found 
that hip, knee, and ankle joint moments predictions had a comparable RMSE with 
an average of 0.069 Nm/kg, while subtalar joint moments had the lowest RMSE of 
0.033 Nm/kg. The real-time feedback that can be derived from the proposed method 
can be highly valuable for sports scientists and physiotherapists to gain 
insights into biomechanics, technique, and form to develop personalized training 
and rehabilitation programs.

Receivers of acoustic communication signals evaluate signal features to identify 
conspecifics. Changes in the ambient temperature can alter these features, 
rendering species recognition a challenge. To maintain effective communication, 
temperature coupling-changes in receiver signal preferences that parallel 
temperature-induced changes in signal parameters-occurs among genetically 
coupled signallers and receivers. Whether eavesdroppers of communication signals 
exhibit temperature coupling is unknown. Here, we investigate if the parasitoid 
fly Ormia ochracea, an eavesdropper of cricket calling songs, exhibits song 
pulse rate preferences that are temperature coupled. We use a high-speed 
treadmill system to record walking phonotaxis at three ambient temperatures (21, 
25, and 30°C) in response to songs that varied in pulse rates (20 to 90 pulses 
per second). Total walking distance, peak steering velocity, angular heading, 
and the phonotaxis performance index varied with song pulse rates and ambient 
temperature. The peak of phonotaxis performance index preference functions 
became broader and shifted to higher pulse rate values at higher temperatures. 
Temperature-related changes in cricket songs between 21 and 30°C did not 
drastically affect the ability of flies to recognize cricket calling songs. 
These results confirm that temperature coupling can occur in eavesdroppers that 
are not genetically coupled with signallers.

Mobile brain imaging with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) can provide 
insight into the cortical processes involved in complex human walking tasks. 
While uneven terrain is common in the natural environment and poses challenges 
to human balance control, there is limited understanding of the supraspinal 
processes involved with traversing uneven terrain. The primary objective of this 
study was to quantify electrocortical activity related to parametric variations 
in terrain unevenness for neurotypical young adults. We used high-density EEG to 
measure brain activity when thirty-two young adults walked on a novel 
custom-made uneven terrain treadmill surface with four levels of difficulty at a 
walking speed tailored to each participant. We identified multiple brain regions 
associated with uneven terrain walking. Alpha (8 - 13 Hz) and beta (13 - 30 Hz) 
spectral power decreased in the sensorimotor and posterior parietal areas with 
increasing terrain unevenness while theta (4 - 8 Hz) power increased in the 
mid/posterior cingulate area with terrain unevenness. We also found that within 
stride spectral power fluctuations increased with terrain unevenness. Our 
secondary goal was to investigate the effect of parametric changes in walking 
speed (0.25 m/s, 0.5m/s, 0.75 m/s, 1.0 m/s) to differentiate the effects of 
walking speed from uneven terrain. Our results revealed that electrocortical 
activities only changed substantially with speed within the sensorimotor area 
but not in other brain areas. Together, these results indicate there are 
distinct cortical processes contributing to the control of walking over uneven 
terrain versus modulation of walking speed on smooth, flat terrain. Our findings 
increase our understanding of cortical involvement in an ecologically valid 
walking task and could serve as a benchmark for identifying deficits in cortical 
dynamics that occur in people with mobility deficits.

Many powered prosthetic devices use load cells to detect ground interaction 
forces and gait events. These sensors introduce additional weight and cost in 
the device. Recent proprioceptive actuators enable an algebraic relationship 
between actuator torques and ground contact forces. This paper presents a 
proprioceptive force sensing paradigm which estimates ground reaction forces as 
a solution to detect gait events without a load cell. A floating body dynamic 
model is obtained with constraints at the center of pressure representing 
foot-ground interaction. Constraint forces are derived to estimate ground 
reaction forces and subsequently timing of gait events. A treadmill experiment 
is conducted with a powered knee-ankle prosthesis used by an able-bodied subject 
walking at various speeds and slopes. Results show accurate gait event timing, 
with pooled data showing heel strike detection lagging by only 6.7 ± 7.2 ms and 
toe off detection leading by 30.4 ± 11.0 ms compared to values obtained from the 
load cell. These results establish proof of concept for predicting gait events 
without a load cell in powered prostheses with proprioceptive actuators.

Footwear may moderate the transiently heightened asymmetry in lower limb loading 
associated with peak growth in adolescence during running. This 
repeated-measures study compared the magnitude and symmetry of peak vertical 
ground reaction force and instantaneous loading rates (VILRs) in adolescents 
during barefoot and shod running. Ten adolescents (age, 10.6 ± 1.7 years) ran at 
self-selected speed (1.7 ± 0.3 m/s) on an instrumented treadmill under three 
counter-balanced conditions; barefoot and shod with partial-minimal and 
conventional running shoes. All participants were within one year of their 
estimated peak height velocity based on sex-specific regression equations. 
Foot-strike patterns, peak vertical ground reaction force and VILRs were 
recorded during 20 seconds of steady-state running. Symmetry of ground reaction 
forces was assessed using the symmetry index. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were used 
to compare conditions (α=.05). Adolescents used a rearfoot foot-strike pattern 
during barefoot and shod running. Use of conventional shoes resulted in a lower 
VILR (P < .05, dz = 0.9), but higher VILR asymmetry (P < .05) than running 
barefoot (dz = 1.5) or in partial-minimal shoes (dz = 1.6). Conventional running 
shoes result in a lower VILR than running unshod or in partial-minimal shoes but 
may have the unintended consequence of increasing VILR asymmetry. The findings 
may have implications for performance, musculoskeletal development and injury in 
adolescents.

Gait speed declines with age and slower walking speeds are associated with poor 
health outcomes. Understanding why we do not walk faster as we age, despite 
being able to, has implications for rehabilitation. Changes in regional 
oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO2) across the frontal lobe were monitored using 
functional near infrared spectroscopy in 17 young and 18 older adults while they 
walked on a treadmill for 5 min, alternating between 30 s of walking at a 
preferred and fast (120% preferred) speed. Gait was quantified using a triaxial 
accelerometer (lower back). Differences between task (preferred/fast) and group 
(young/old) and associations between regional HbO2 and gait were evaluated. 
Paired tests indicated increased HbO2 in the supplementary motor area (right) 
and primary motor cortex (left and right) in older adults when walking fast (p < 
0.006). HbO2 did not significantly change in the young when walking fast, 
despite both groups modulating gait. When evaluating the effect of age (linear 
mixed effects model), greater increases in HbO2 were observed for older adults 
when walking fast (prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area 
and primary motor cortex) compared to young adults. In older adults, increased 
step length and reduced step length variability were associated with larger 
increases in HbO2 across multiple regions when walking fast. Walking fast 
required increased activation of motor regions in older adults, which may serve 
as a therapeutic target for rehabilitation. Widespread increases in HbO2 across 
the frontal cortex highlight that walking fast represents a resource-intensive

PURPOSE: Numerous exercise interventions to enhance motor function in cerebral 
palsy (CP) have been proposed, with varying degrees of effectiveness. Because 
motor function requires a combination of muscle strength, joint flexibility, and 
motor coordination, we designed a supervised multicomponent exercise 
intervention (EXErcise for Cerebral Palsy, or EXECP) for individuals with CP. 
Our aim was to evaluate the effects of the EXECP intervention and its retention 
after it ceased.
METHODS: The EXECP intervention combined strength training for the lower limbs 
and trunk muscles, passive stretching for the lower limb muscles, and inclined 
treadmill gait training. Eighteen participants with CP (mean age, 14 yr; 13 were 
male) were tested twice before the 3-month intervention and twice after the 
intervention, each test separated by 3 months. Seventeen typically developing 
age- and sex-matched controls were tested twice. Motor function was assessed 
with the 6-min walking test (6MWT) and the gross motor function measure 
dimensions D and E. Passive joint flexibility was measured with goniometry. 
Isometric and concentric muscle strength were assessed at the knee, ankle, and 
trunk joints.
RESULTS: The EXECP intervention successfully increased 6MWT ( P < 0.001), gross 
motor function measure ( P = 0.004), and muscle strength for knee and trunk 
muscles ( P < 0.05), although no changes were observed for ankle joint muscles. 
Hip and knee joint flexibility also increased ( P < 0.05). After the retention 
period, all tested variables except the 6MWT and knee joint flexibility 
regressed and were not different from the pretests.
CONCLUSIONS: The improvements in strength, flexibility, and possibly motor 
coordination brought by the EXECP intervention were transferred to significant 
functional gains. The regression toward baseline after the intervention 
highlights that training must be a lifelong decision for individuals with CP.

BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery is effective for patients with severe obesity, but 
relatively little is known about long-term functional outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To describe physical fitness and activity changes among bariatric 
surgery patients in a clinical trial of physical activity interventions through 
5 years postoperatively.
SETTING: Large bariatric center in the midwestern United States.
METHODS: Preoperatively, 6 months, and 5 years after surgery, 42 bariatric 
surgery patients wore an accelerometer to track activity and completed strength 
and cardiovascular endurance testing via treadmill, where estimated metabolic 
equivalents (METs) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPEs) were obtained.
RESULTS: Preoperatively, 25% of patients reported exertion of <3 METs 
(equivalent to walking 2.5 mi/hr) as an RPE of 16 (""hard to very hard""). This 
decreased significantly to approximately 5% of patients 6 months and 5 years 
after surgery. Before surgery, 7.5% achieved ≥6 METs (vigorous activity) at an 
RPE of 16. This increased significantly to 36.6% at 6 months and 42.1% at 5 
years after surgery. Body mass index and age, but no physical activity measure, 
predicted functional ability over time. The steps/d and exercise bout min/wk 
increased significantly from before surgery to 6 months postoperatively (4886.5 
to 5948.5 steps and 23.8 to 66.6 bout min), but increases were not maintained at 
5 years (5677.7 steps and 41.4 bout min). Conversely, moderate to vigorous min/ 
d increased progressively from before surgery (17.4) to 6 months (32.3) and 5 
years (48.1) postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Functional abilities of bariatric surgery patients increased 
postoperatively and were maintained over 5 years. However, treadmill testing 
suggests that most patients are still unable to perform sustained activities of 
6 METs (vigorous) or greater. Research is needed on bariatric patients' 
long-term function- and intervention- optimizing outcomes.

Researchers and engineers have developed exoskeletons capable of reducing the 
energetic cost of walking by decreasing the force their users' muscles are 
required to produce while contracting. The metabolic effect of assisting 
concentric and isometric muscle contractions depends, in part, on assistance 
magnitude. We conducted human treadmill experiments to explore the effects of 
assistance magnitude on the biomechanics and energetics of walking with an 
energy-removing exoskeleton designed to assist eccentric muscle contractions. 
Our results demonstrate that the assistance magnitude of an energy-removing 
device significantly affects the energetics, muscle activity, and biomechanics 
of walking. Under the moderate assistance magnitude condition, our device 
reduced the metabolic cost of walking below that of normal walking by 3.4% while 
simultaneously producing 0.29 W of electricity. This reduction in the energetic 
cost of walking was also associated with an 8.9% decrease in hamstring activity. 
Furthermore, we determined that there is an assistance magnitude threshold that, 
when crossed, results in the device transitioning from assisting to hindering 
its user. This transition is marked by significant increases in muscle activity 
and the metabolic cost of walking. These results could aid in the future design 
of exoskeletons and biomechanical energy harvesters, as well as adaptive control 
systems, that identify user-specific control parameters associated with minimum 
energy expenditure.

We investigated the effect of regular walking exercise prior to knee 
osteoarthritis (OA) on pain and synovitis in a rat monoiodoacetic acid 
(MIA)-induced knee OA model. Seventy-one male Wistar rats were divided into 
three groups: (i) Sedentary + OA, (ii) Exercise + OA, and (iii) Sedentary + Sham 
groups. The Exercise + OA group underwent a regular treadmill walking exercise 
at 10 m/min (60 min/day, 5 days/week) for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-mg MIA 
injection in the right knee. The right knee joint was removed from rats in this 
group at the end of the 6-week exercise period and at 1 and 6 weeks after the 
MIA injection. After the 6 weeks of treadmill exercise but before MIA injection, 
there were no significant differences among the three groups in the pressure 
pain threshold, whereas at 1 week post-injection, the Exercise + OA group's 
pressure pain threshold was significantly higher than that in the Sedentary + OA 
group, and this difference persisted until the end of the experimental period. 
The histological changes in articular cartilage and subchondral bone revealed by 
toluidine blue staining showed no difference between the Sedentary + OA and EX + 
OA groups. The expression levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 mRNA in the 
infrapatellar fat pad and synovium were significantly increased by the treadmill 
exercise. Significant reductions in the number of CD68-, CD11c-positive cells 
and IL-1β mRNA expression and an increase in the number of CD206-positive cells 
were observed at 1 week after the MIA injection in the Exercise + OA group 
compared to the Sedentary + OA group. These results suggest that regular walking 
exercise prior to the development of OA could alleviate joint pain through 
increases in the expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines in the rat 
infrapatellar fat pad and synovium.

The serum concentration of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP) is 
considered a mechanosensitive biomarker of articular cartilage turnover, and 
N-propeptide of type II collagen (PIIANP), a proposed biomarker of type II 
collagen synthesis. Few studies have investigated the anabolic and turnover 
response of articular cartilage in response to acute changes in body mass during 
exercise. Using a repeated measure cross-over design, 15 healthy adults (age 
18-30 years) performed three 30 min bouts of treadmill walking exercise under 
three loading conditions: (1) control (no alteration to body mass); (2) loaded 
(12% increase in body mass using a weighted vest); and (3) unloaded (12% 
decrease in body mass using lower body positive pressure). Venous blood was 
collected before, immediately after, and 15 and 30 min after exercise to 
investigate cartilage turnover (sCOMP) and anabolism (PIIANP). A main time 
effect (p ≤ 0.05) revealed that sCOMP levels were significantly greater 
post-exercise (for all three body loading conditions) as compared to before 
exercise, 15 and 30 min post-exercise. There was a significant condition × time 
interaction (p ≤ 0.05) for PIIANP, indicating that in the loaded condition, 
PIIANP concentrations at 15 min post-exercise were 13.8% greater than 
immediately following exercise, and 12.9% greater than before exercise. In 
summary, sCOMP concentration was acutely increased with all three loading 
conditions. However, PIIANP increased only after exercise in the loaded 
condition, suggesting an acute anabolic effect on articular cartilage.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer patients are recommended to engage in regular 
exercise. In developing countries, where there is a lack of facilities to offer 
specialized, supervised exercise for this population, regularly exercising might 
be a challenge. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based 
intervention in this population.
METHODS: Breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned to either the home-based 
exercise program or the usual care group. Exercise intervention included 
walking, balance, and stretch exercises, along with weekly follow-up telephone 
calls. Quality of life (QOL) was evaluated using EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC 
QLQ-BR23 questionnaires and the predicted VO2 peak was measured using the 
Ebbeling submaximal treadmill test.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were enrolled in the study. Reported minutes of 
exercise gradually increased from 40.7 min per week in week 1 to 116.9 min per 
week in week 12. This intervention improved global QOL (P = 0.001), social 
functioning (P = 0.04), and the predicted VO2 peak (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This home-based exercise regime effectively increased quality of 
life and physical activity levels.

There is widespread use of incremental shuttle walking test (ISWT) to measure 
functional capacity in cardiac rehabilitation patients. Due to occasional 
physical space limitations, an incremental shuttle walking test on a treadmill 
(ISWT-T) was suggested as an alternative. Knowledge about the cardiopulmonary 
response between the two tests and the factors associated with the distance 
achieved in Phase IV cardiac rehabilitation is limited. Thus, the study aims to 
compare the cardiopulmonary response between ISWT and ISWT-T and investigate the 
factors associated with distance achieved in both tests. Thirteen participants 
(66.3 ± 7.3 years, 84.6% males) attending phase IV cardiac rehabilitation 
participated in repeated measures counterbalanced trials. Each participant 
performed one ISWT and one ISWT-T separated by seven days. Main outcome measures 
included peak heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure post-test, 
distance achieved, respiratory frequency, tidal volume (VT), minute ventilation, 
respiratory exchange ratio, peak oxygen uptake (VO2PEAK), and secondary outcome 
measures included height, weight, waist circumference (WC) leg length (LL). 
There were no significant differences in the cardiopulmonary responses between 
ISWT and ISWT-T except for VO2PEAK (25.4 ± 5.8 vs 23.7 ± 5.1, p = 0.05, 
respectively). Age and height were significantly correlated with distance 
achieved during ISWT, and ISWT-T [age (r = - 0.72, vs. r = - 0.73, p ≤ 0.05, 
respectively)], [height (r = 0.68, vs. r = 0.68, p ≤ 0.05, respectively)]. LL 
was only correlated with distance achieved on ISWT-T (r = 0.59, p ≤ 0.05). These 
findings suggest a similar cardiopulmonary response between the two tests, but 
doing ISWT in the hallway evoked a higher metabolic demand than doing it on a 
treadmill. Additionally, distance achieved on both tests was related to height 
and inversely to age.

Background Real-world evidence for the selection of gatekeeping studies in 
patients with suspected coronary syndromes is limited. Methods and Results We 
identified 27 036 patients who underwent coronary computed tomography 
angiography (CCTA), single-photon emission computed tomography, and the 
treadmill test for suspected coronary syndromes from the Korean National Health 
Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort between 2006 and 2014. The primary end 
point was a composite of cardiac death and myocardial infarction, and the 
secondary end point was a composite of the primary end point and 
revascularization. During a median follow-up of 5.4 years, the risk of both 
primary and secondary end points was significantly higher in the single-photon 
emission computed tomography group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.81 [95% CI, 1.34-2.45]; 
and HR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.22-1.66]), but significantly lower in the treadmill test 
group (HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.42-0.67]; and HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.62-0.76]) compared 
with the CCTA group. After balancing baseline risk factors, there was no 
significant difference in the primary end point in those with single-photon 
emission computed tomography (HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.78-1.57]; P=0.58) or treadmill 
test (HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.65-1.08]; P=0.18) groups, compared with the CCTA 
group. The event rate of the secondary end point was significantly lower in the 
treadmill test group than in the CCTA group (HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.78-0.96]; 
P=0.008). Conclusions Compared with functional testing, initial CCTA was not 
associated with a lower rate of cardiac death or myocardial infarction when used 
as an initial diagnostic test for patients with suspected coronary syndromes.

Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

BACKGROUND: The ability to objectively measure spatiotemporal metrics within 
individuals post-stroke is integral to plan appropriate intervention, track 
recovery, and ultimately improve efficacy of rehabilitation programs. Inertial 
measurement units (IMUs) provide a means to systematically collect gait-specific 
metrics that could not otherwise be obtained from clinical outcomes. However, 
the use of IMUs to measure spatiotemporal parameters in stroke survivors has yet 
to be validated. The purpose of this study is to determine the validity and 
reliability of IMU-recorded spatiotemporal gait metrics as compared to a motion 
capture camera system (MCCS) in individuals post-stroke.
METHODS: Participants (n = 23, M/F = 12/11, mean (SD) age = 50.2(11.1) 
spatiotemporal data were collected simultaneously from a MCCS and APDM Opal IMUs 
during a five-minute treadmill walking task at a self-selected speed. Criterion 
validity and test-retest reliability were assessed using Lin's concordance 
correlation coefficients (CCCs) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), 
respectively. Spatiotemporal values from MCCS and IMU were used to calculate 
gait asymmetry, and a t-test was used to assess the difference between asymmetry 
values.
RESULTS: There were fair-to-excellent agreement between IMU and MCCS of temporal 
parameters (CCC 0.56-0.98), excellent agreement of spatial parameters (CCC 
>0.90), and excellent test-retest reliability for all parameters (ICC >0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to motion capture, the APDM Opal IMUs produced accurate 
and reliable measures of spatiotemporal parameters. Findings support the use of 
IMUs to assess spatiotemporal parameters in individual's post-stroke.

Abduction/Adduction Assistance From Powered Hip Exoskeleton Enables Modulation 
of User Step Width During Walking.

Alili A, Fleming A, Nalam V, Liu M, Dean J, Huang H.

Using wearable robotics to modulate step width in normal walking for enhanced 
mediolateral balance has not been demonstrated in the field. We designed a 
bilateral hip exoskeleton with admittance control to power hip abduction and 
adduction to modulate step width.
OBJECTIVE: As the first step to show its potential, the objective of this study 
was to investigate how human's step width reacted to hip exoskeleton's 
admittance control parameter changes during walking.
METHODS: Ten non-disabled individuals walked on a treadmill at a self-selected 
speed, while wearing our bilateral robotic hip exoskeleton. We used two 
equilibrium positions to define the direction of assistance. We studied the 
influence of multiple stiffness values in the admittance control on the 
participants' step width, step length, and electromyographic (EMG) activity of 
the gluteus medius.
RESULTS: Step width were significantly modulated by the change of stiffness in 
exoskeleton control, while step length did not show significant changes. When 
the stiffness changed from zero to our studied stiffness values, the 
participants' step width started to modulate immediately. Within 4 consecutive 
heel strikes right after a stiffness change, the step width showed a significant 
change. Interestingly, EMG activity of the gluteus medius did not change 
significantly regardless the applied stiffness and powered direction.
CONCLUSION: Tuning of stiffness in admittance control of a hip exoskeleton, 
acting in mediolateral direction, can be a viable way for controlling step width 
in normal walking. Unvaried gluteus medius activity indicates that the increase 
in step width were mainly caused by the assistive torque applied by the 
exoskeleton.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our study results pave a new way for future design and control of 
wearable robotics in enhancing mediolateral walking balance for various 
rehabilitation applications.

Introduction: Human-in-the-loop optimization algorithms have proven useful in 
optimizing complex interactive problems, such as the interaction between humans 
and robotic exoskeletons. Specifically, this methodology has been proven valid 
for reducing metabolic cost while wearing robotic exoskeletons. However, many 
prostheses and orthoses still consist of passive elements that require manual 
adjustments of settings. Methods: In the present study, we investigated if 
human-in-the-loop algorithms could guide faster manual adjustments in a 
procedure similar to fitting a prosthesis. Eight healthy participants wore a 
prosthesis simulator and walked on a treadmill at 0.8 ms-1 under 16 combinations 
of shoe heel height and pylon height. A human-in-the-loop optimization algorithm 
was used to find an optimal combination for reducing the loading rate on the 
limb contralateral to the prosthesis simulator. To evaluate the performance of 
the optimization algorithm, we used a convergence criterium. We evaluated the 
accuracy by comparing it against the optimum from a full sweep of all 
combinations. Results: In five out of the eight participants, the 
human-in-the-loop optimization reduced the time taken to find an optimal 
combination; however, in three participants, the human-in-the-loop optimization 
either converged by the last iteration or did not converge. Discussion: Findings 
from this study show that the human-in-the-loop methodology could be helpful in 
tasks that require manually adjusting an assistive device, such as optimizing an 
unpowered prosthesis. However, further research is needed to achieve robust 
performance and evaluate applicability in persons with amputation wearing an 
actual prosthesis.

Virtual reality (VR), coupled with motion tracking, can investigate walking in a 
controlled setting while applying various walking challenges. The purpose of 
this review was to summarize the evidence on consequences of VR on biomechanical 
gait parameters in children with cerebral palsy. MEDLINE, Embase and Web of 
Science were searched. Among 7.574 studies, screened by two independent 
reviewers, seven studies were included, analyzing treadmill (n = 6) or 
overground walking (n = 1) under VR. Most frequently reported were the 
spatiotemporal parameters walking speed, stride length, step width, stance 
phase, and the kinematic parameters range of knee flexion and peak ankle 
dorsiflexion. However, methodological approaches and reporting of the results 
were inconsistent among studies. This review reveals that VR can complement 
information gained from clinical gait analysis. However, this is still an 
emerging field of research and there is limited knowledge on the effect of VR on 
gait parameters, notably during overground walking.

activation and dual-task performance in older adults.

As individuals age, they may experience a decline in gait automaticity, which 
requires increased attentional resources for the control of gait. This 
age-related decline in gait automaticity has been shown to contribute to higher 
prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation and lower dual-task performance during 
dual-task walking in older adults. This study is to investigate the effect of 
treadmill walking on PFC activation and dual-task performance in older adults. A 
total of 20 older adults (mean age, 64.35 ± 2.74 years) and 20 younger adults 
(mean age, 30.00 ± 3.15 years) performed single- and dual-task walking in 
overground and treadmill conditions. A wearable functional near-infrared 
spectroscopy and gait analyzer were used to analyze PFC activation and dual-task 
performance, respectively. To determine the dual-task (gait and cognitive) 
performance, the dual-task cost (DTC) was calculated using the following 
formula: (single-task - dual-task)/single-task × 100. In both groups, dual-task 
treadmill walking led to reduced PFC activation and reduced DTC compared to 
dual-task overground walking. Furthermore, despite a higher DTC in gait 
variability, correct response, total response, response index and a higher error 
score in older adults than in younger adults during overground walking, there 
was no difference in treadmill walking. The difference in PFC activation between 
single- and dual-tasks was also observed only in overground walking. Performing 
dual-task walking on a treadmill compared to overground walking results in 
different levels of dual-task performance and PFC activity. Specifically, older 
adults are able to maintain similar levels of dual-task performance as younger 
adults while walking on a treadmill, with reduced PFC activation due to the 
automaticity induced by the treadmill. Therefore, older adults who exhibit low 
dual-task performance during overground walking may be able to improve their 
performance while walking on a treadmill with fewer attentional resources.

BACKGROUND: Reactive lower limb muscle function during walking plays a role in 
balance, stability, and ultimately fall prevention. The objective of this study 
was to evaluate muscle and joint function used to regain balance after 
trip-based perturbations during walking.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How are lower limb muscles used to recover from external 
tripping during walking?
METHOD: The dominant legs of 20 healthy adult participants with similar athletic 
backgrounds were tripped using a split-belt instrumented treadmill. High- and 
medium-intensity trips were simulated by deceleration of the dominant leg at 
initial contact from the speed of 1.1 m/s to 0 m/s and back to 1.1 m/s in 0.4 s 
and 0.8 s, respectively. Lower limb kinematics, kinetics, and muscle forces 
following perturbations were computed to pre-perturbation values using 
statistical parametric mapping (SPM) paired t-test.
RESULTS: A greater ankle dorsiflexion angle (mean difference: 5.3°), ankle 
plantar flexion moment (mean difference: 0.6 Nm/kg), and gastrocnemius and 
soleus muscle forces (mean difference: 4.27 N/kg and 13.56 N/kg for GAS and SOL, 
respectively) were observed post-perturbation step despite the magnitude of the 
perturbation.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study concludes that adequate timely response of ankle 
function during a compensatory step is required for a successful recovery after 
tripping during walking in young healthy adults. Weakness in plantar flexors 
suggests insufficient ankle moments, which ultimately can result in falls. The 
findings of this paper can be used as a reference for the joint moments and 
range of motion needed to recover trips in the design of assistive devices. In 
addition to that, clinicians can use the estimated values of muscle forces and 
the pattern of muscle activities to design targeted training in fall prevention 
among the elderly.

PURPOSE: Variable-speed control in the field is challenging for motion science. 
Tests were performed to evaluate speed, Froude number, and oxygen consumption if 
these varied when using the same frequency of steps. The objective of this study 
was to evaluate the use of auditory feedback to control variable speed on the 
treadmill and track during acceleration cycles around the transition speed.
METHODS: Twenty-four trained men participated. The protocol was based on 5 ramps 
of 50 seconds each around 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%, and 120% of the walking-running 
transition speed, recording the frequency of steps with a mobile phone during 
the treadmill test. The tests were replicated on the track using auditory 
feedback.
RESULTS: When evaluating each speed of the protocols separately for the same 
frequency of steps, the average speed on the track was always higher on average 
at 54.7% compared to the laboratory (P < .050), and on the track, it was 16.2% 
higher than in the laboratory (P > .050).
CONCLUSIONS: It cannot be considered that the same frequency of steps is 
equivalent to the same speed in the laboratory and on the track. These results 
point to the importance of reliable speed control during open field tests.

PURPOSE: Muscle contraction type in resistance exercise training may confer 
benefits besides strength in individuals with osteoarthritis and cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) risks. The purpose of the study was to explore whether 
Eccentric-resistance training (RT) improved hemodynamic responses to acute 
walking exercise stress compared to Concentric-RT among individuals with knee OA 
over four months.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis from a randomized, controlled, 
single-blinded study. Participants (N = 88; 68.3 ± 6.4 yrs; 67.4% female) were 
randomized to one of two work-matched resistance training (RT) programs against 
a non-RT control group. Pre-training and month four, participants completed a 
self-paced Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and progressive treadmill exercise test. 
Heart rates, blood pressures and mean arterial pressures (MAP) were captured 
during each test. Antihypertensive medications use was documented at each time 
point.
RESULTS: Leg strength improved in both training groups by month four (p < .05). 
Changes in 6MWT distance and progressive treadmill test time were not different 
across groups over four months. Neither Concentric or Eccentric RT produced 
different hemodyamic responses during the 6MWT compared to the control group 
post-training. However, Concentric RT was associated with 6.0%-7.4% reductions 
in systolic blood pressure during the graded treadmill walking test at 50%, 75% 
and 100% of the test time compared to Eccentric RT and the controls (p = .045). 
MAP values were lower at 75% and 100% of the treadmill test after Concentric RT 
(5.7%-6.0% reductions) compared to Eccentric RT (1.0%-2.4% reductions) and 
controls (1.5% and 4.0% elevations) post-training (p = .024). Antihypertensive 
medication use did not change in any group.
CONCLUSIONS: The repeated, progressive exposures of Concentric RT-induced 
blunted the hypertensive responses to acute exercise compared to Eccentric-RT. 
Among people with knee OA, Concentric-RT may confer strength benefits to manage 
OA and possibly reduce cardiovascular stress during exercise.

Metabolic cost of walking with electromechanical ankle exoskeletons under 
proportional myoelectric control on a treadmill and outdoors.

Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States of America.

Lower limb robotic exoskeletons are often studied in the context of steady state 
treadmill walking in a laboratory environment. However, the end goal for 
exoskeletons is to be used in real world, complex environments. To reach the 
point that exoskeletons are openly adopted into our everyday lives, we need to 
understand how the human and robot interact outside of a laboratory. Metabolic 
cost is often viewed as a gold standard metric for measuring exoskeleton 
performance but is rarely used to evaluate performance at non steady state 
walking outside of a laboratory. In this study, we tested the effects of robotic 
ankle exoskeletons under proportional myoelectric control on the cost of 
transport of walking both inside on a treadmill and outside overground. We 
hypothesized that walking with the exoskeletons would lead to a lower cost of 
transport compared to walking without them both on a treadmill and outside. We 
saw no significant increases or decreases in cost of transport or exoskeleton 
mechanics when walking with the exoskeletons compared to walking without them 
both on a treadmill and outside. We saw a strong negative correlation between 
walking speed and cost of transport when walking with and without the 
exoskeletons. In the future, research should consider how performing more 
difficult tasks, such as incline and loaded walking, affects the cost of 
transport while walking with and without robotic ankle exoskeletons. The value 
of this study to the literature is that it emphasizes the importance of both 
hardware dynamics and controller design towards reducing metabolic cost of 
transport with robotic ankle exoskeletons. When comparing our results to other 
studies using the same hardware with different controllers or very similar 
controllers with different hardware, there are a wide range of outcomes as to 
metabolic benefit.

Electrocortical activity correlated with locomotor adaptation during split-belt 
treadmill walking.

Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.

Locomotor adaptation is crucial for daily gait adjustments to changing 
environmental demands and obstacle avoidance. Mobile brain imaging with 
high-density electroencephalography (EEG) now permits quantification of 
electrocortical dynamics during human locomotion. To determine the brain areas 
involved in human locomotor adaptation, we recorded high-density EEG from 
healthy, young adults during split-belt treadmill walking. We incorporated a 
dual-electrode EEG system and neck electromyography to decrease motion and 
muscle artefacts. Voluntary movement preparation and execution have been linked 
to alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta band (13-30 Hz) desynchronizations in the 
sensorimotor and posterior parietal cortices, whereas theta band (4-7 Hz) 
modulations in the anterior cingulate have been correlated with movement error 
monitoring. We hypothesized that relative to normal walking, split-belt walking 
would elicit: (1) decreases in alpha and beta band power in sensorimotor and 
posterior parietal cortices, reflecting enhanced motor flexibility; and (2) 
increases in theta band power in anterior cingulate cortex, reflecting 
instability and balance errors that will diminish with practice. We found 
electrocortical activity in multiple regions that was associated with stages of 
gait adaptation. Data indicated that sensorimotor and posterior parietal 
cortices had decreased alpha and beta band spectral power during early 
adaptation to split-belt treadmill walking that gradually returned to 
pre-adaptation levels by the end of the adaptation period. Our findings 
emphasize that multiple brain areas are involved in adjusting gait under 
changing environmental demands during human walking. Future studies could use 
these findings on healthy, young participants to identify dysfunctional 
supraspinal mechanisms that may be impairing gait adaptation. KEY POINTS: 
Identifying the location and time course of electrical changes in the brain 
correlating with gait adaptation increases our understanding of brain function 
and provides targets for brain stimulation interventions. Using high-density EEG 
in combination with 3D biomechanics, we found changes in neural oscillations 
localized near the sensorimotor, posterior parietal and cingulate cortices 
during split-belt treadmill adaptation. These findings suggest that multiple 
cortical mechanisms may be associated with locomotor adaptation, and their 
temporal dynamics can be quantified using mobile EEG. Results from this study 
can serve as a reference model to examine brain dynamics in individuals with 
movement disorders that cause gait asymmetry and reduced gait adaptation.

AIMS: To evaluate the effects of different durations of continuous aerobic 
exercise on prediabetic patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research encompassed randomized controlled trials 
that examined how various durations of aerobic exercise training affected 
outcomes related to Body Mass Index (BMI), Fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour 
plasma glucose (2hPG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in individuals diagnosed 
with prediabetes. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were 
searched as of January 7, 2023. The Cochrane Risk of Bias, version 2 (ROB 2) 
tool was used to assess the risk of bias.
RESULTS: A total of 10 RCTs with 815 prediabetic patients were included. The 
average age of the participants was 56.1 years, with a standard deviation of 5.1 
years. Among the participants, 39.2% were male. The interventions consisted of 
aerobic dance, treadmill running, walking, and a combination of aerobic 
exercises. The training sessions occurred three or four times per week. In 
prediabetic patients, aerobic exercise demonstrated a significant reduction in 
BMI compared to the control group, with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 
-1.44 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.89, -0.98). There was a decrease in 
FBG levels, with WMD of -0.51 mmol/L (95% CI -0.70, -0.32). Additionally, 
aerobic training led to significant improvements in 2hPG levels, with a WMD of 
-0.76 mmol/L (95% CI -1.14, -0.38). Furthermore, prediabetic patients showed a 
decrease in HbA1c levels after engaging in aerobic training compared to the 
control group, with a WMD of -0.34% (95% CI -0.45, -0.23).
CONCLUSION: In summary, engaging in aerobic exercise can have a significant 
positive impact on glycemic levels in individuals with prediabetes. It can also 
lead to reductions in BMI, FBG, 2hPG, HbA1c, and other relevant indicators. The 
extent of these improvements may vary slightly depending on the duration of the 
aerobic exercise intervention.

BACKGROUND: The impact of a single-session Pilates exercise on cardiorespiratory 
fitness and metabolic parameters is still uncertain.
AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the cardiorespiratory changes during 
a single-session Pilates exercise and compare cardiorespiratory fitness-related 
parameters with walking at different speeds on a treadmill, at low (3.2 kph) and 
moderate intensities (4.8 kph).
METHODS: Cardiorespiratory responses were measured with a cardiopulmonary 
exercise test device in 31 healthy young adults at rest, during a single Pilates 
session, walking at 3.2 kph and walking at 4.8 kph. The study design employed a 
cross-over design. Participants were randomly assigned to two experimental 
groups: a Pilates training session following treadmill walking or treadmill 
walking following a Pilates training session.
RESULTS: Mean MET, oxygen and energy consumption during Pilates were similar to 
walking at 3.2 kph (p > 0.05), but significantly lower than walking at 4.8 kph 
(p < 0.05). The mean heart rate during Pilates was higher than walking at 3.2 
kph (p < 0.05), but similar to walking at 4.8 kph (p > 0.05). Significantly 
higher carbohydrate metabolism was used during Pilates compared to walking 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The cardiopulmonary responses to a single Pilates session are 
similar to walking at a speed of 3.2 kph but lower than walking at 4.8 kph. 
These results indicate that while Pilates may not generate sufficient 
cardiopulmonary changes to enhance cardiorespiratory fitness as a 
moderate-intensity exercise in healthy young adults, it may still offer other 
benefits such as improvements in flexibility, core strength, and posture.

The loadsol® wireless in-shoe force sensors can be useful for in-field 
measurements. However, its accuracy is unknown in the military context, whereby 
soldiers have to carry heavy loads and walk in military boots. The purpose of 
this study was to establish the validity of the loadsol® sensors in military 
personnel during loaded walking on flat, inclined and declined surfaces. 
Full-time Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) personnel (n = 8) walked on an 
instrumented treadmill on flat, 10° inclined, and 10° declined gradients while 
carrying heavy loads (25 kg and 35 kg). Normal ground reaction forces (GRF), 
perpendicular to the contact surface, were simultaneously measured using both 
the loadsol® sensors inserted in the military boots and the Bertec instrumented 
treadmill as the gold standard. A total of eight variables of interest were 
compared between loadsol® and treadmill, including four kinetic (impact peak 
force, active peak force, impulse, loading rate) and four spatiotemporal (stance 
time, stride time, cadence, step length) variables. Validity was assessed using 
Bland-Altman plots and 95% Limits of Agreement (LoA). Bias was calculated as the 
mean difference between the values obtained from loadsol® and the instrumented 
treadmill. Results showed similar force-time profiles between loadsol® sensors 
and the instrumented treadmill. The bias of most variables was generally low, 
with a narrow range of LoA. The high accuracy and good agreement with standard 
laboratory equipment suggest that the loadsol® system is a valid tool for 
measuring normal GRF during walking in military boots under heavy load carriage.

Control of foot placement is an essential strategy for maintaining balance 
during walking. During unperturbed, steady-state walking, foot placement can be 
accurately described as a linear function of the body's center of mass state at 
midstance. However, it is uncertain if this mapping from center of mass state to 
foot placement generalizes to larger perturbations that may be more likely to 
cause falls. These perturbations may cause balance disturbances and generate 
reactive control strategies not observed during unperturbed walking. Here, we 
used unpredictable changes in treadmill speed to assess the generalizability of 
foot placement mappings identified during unperturbed walking. We found that 
foot placement mappings generalized poorly from unperturbed to perturbed walking 
and differed for forward versus backward perturbations. We also used singular 
value decomposition of the mapping matrix to reveal that people were more 
sensitive to backward versus forward perturbations. Together, these results 
indicate that control of foot placement during losses of balance differs from 
the control strategies used during unperturbed walking. Better characterization 
of human balance control strategies could improve our understanding of why 
different neuromotor disorders result in heightened fall risk and inform the 
design of controllers for balance-assisting devices.

BACKGROUND: Interventions using split belt treadmills (SBTM) aim to improve gait 
symmetry (GA) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Comparative effects in conjugated 
SBTM conditions were not studied systematically despite potentially affecting 
intervention outcomes. We compared gait adaptation effects instigated by SBTM 
walking with respect to the type (increased\decreased speed) and the side 
(more/less affected) of the manipulated belt in PD.
METHODS: Eight individuals with PD performed four trials of SBTM walking, each 
consisted of baseline tied belt configuration, followed by split belt setting - 
either WS or BS belt's speed increased or decreased by 50% from baseline, and 
final tied belt configuration. Based on the disease's motor symptoms, a 'worst' 
side (WS) and a 'best' side (BS) were defined for each participant.
RESULTS: SB initial change in GA was significant regardless of condition 
(p ≤ 0.02). This change was however more pronounced for BS-decrease compared 
with its matching condition WS-increase (p = 0.016). Similarly, the same was 
observed for WS-decrease compared to BS-increase (p = 0.013). Upon returning to 
tied belt condition, both BS-decrease and WS-increased resulted in a significant 
change in GA (p = 0.04). Upper limb asymmetry followed a similar trend of GA 
reversal, although non-significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Stronger effects on GA were obtained by decreasing the BS belt's 
speed of the best side, rather than increasing the speed of the worst side. 
Albeit a small sample size, which limits the generalisability of these results, 
we propose that future clinical studies would benefit from considering such 
methodological planning of SBTM intervention, for maximising of intervention 
outcomes. Larger samples may reveal arm swinging asymmetries alterations to 
match SBTM adaptation patterns. Finally, further research is warranted to study 
post-adaption effects in order to define optimal adaptation schemes to maximise 
the therapeutic effect of SBTM based interventions.

Individuals with neuromuscular deficits often walk with wider step widths 
compared to healthy adults. Wider steps have been linked to a higher 
destabilizing frontal-plane external moment and greater range of frontal-plane 
whole-body angular momentum (HR), which is an indicator of decreased balance 
control. The purpose of this study was to experimentally determine 1) how step 
width alters balance control during steady-state walking, and 2) if step width 
changes the balance response strategies following mediolateral surface 
perturbations in healthy adults. Fifteen healthy young adults (7 male, age: 
25 ± 4 years) walked on an instrumented treadmill at narrow, self-selected, wide 
and extra-wide step widths. During perturbed trials, the treadmill provided 
random mediolateral surface translations to each foot midway through 
single-leg-stance. Muscle electromyography, biomechanical measures (HR, 
frontal-plane external moment and joint moments) and deviations (differences in 
these measures between the perturbed and unperturbed walking trials) were 
compared across step widths. During steady state walking, wider steps were 
associated with decreased balance control. Increasing step widths were also 
associated with increased gluteus medius activity and reduced hip abduction and 
ankle inversion moments, which suggests healthy subjects rely more on a lateral 
ankle strategy to maintain balance at increasing step widths. There was no 
change in the plantarflexion moment. During perturbed walking, lateral, but not 
medial, surface translations adversely affected balance control. Further, wider 
steps did not change the balance response strategies following the 
perturbations, which suggests healthy individuals have the capacity to respond 
similarly to the perturbations at different step widths.

Aging is associated with cognitive deficits, with spatial memory being very 
susceptible to decline. The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is important for 
processing spatial information in the brain and is particularly vulnerable to 
aging, yet its sparse activity has led to difficulties in assessing changes in 
this area. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we compared DG neuronal 
activity and representations of space in young and aged mice walking on an 
unfamiliar treadmill. We found that calcium activity was significantly higher 
and less tuned to location in aged mice, resulting in decreased spatial 
information encoded in the DG. However, with repeated exposure to the same 
treadmill, both spatial tuning and information levels in aged mice became 
similar to young mice, while activity remained elevated. Our results show that 
spatial representations of novel environments are impaired in the aged 
hippocampus and gradually improve with increased familiarity. Moreover, while 
the aged DG is hyperexcitable, this does not disrupt neural representations of 
familiar environments.

Humans have stepped on the Lunar surface for less than 80 h of Extravehicular 
Activity, providing a narrow understanding of Lunar gait patterns. NASA's 
Human-crewed Artemis missions are quickly approaching; understanding how 
fractional gravity affects gait patterns will be critical for the Moon's and 
Mars' long-term habitation. This study examined gait patterns under 1.0 g 
(Earth), simulated 0.38 g (Martian), and 0.17 g (Lunar). Participants walked and 
ran on a treadmill supported by ARGOS (Active Response Gravity Offload System), 
simulating fractional gravity. Vicon motion capture data and principal component 
analysis software were used to capture and quantify coordinated gait structures. 
There were found to be significant differences (p < 0.05) in the coordinative 
gait structures for ambulation between fractional gravity conditions. 
Additionally, there were significantly higher asymmetric gait components for 
Lunar conditions. Finally, a skipping coordinative structure was identified 
within Lunar and Martian running.

BACKGROUND: The plantar venous pump (PVP), composed of deep plantar veins, is 
the most distal contributor to venous return from the lower limbs. A pressing 
need still exists to assess how plantar muscle contraction and gait affect PVP 
function, how foot stato-dynamic disorders (FSDs) can contribute to venous 
insufficiency, and how venous return can be optimally stimulated. Our first 
objective is to compare the venous blood hemodynamics in lower limbs between 
healthy subjects with a FSD and healthy subjects without a FSD to understand the 
influence of foot morphology in the performance of the PVP. Our second objective 
is to evaluate whether PVP function varies with different plantar pressures.
METHODS: A total of 52 healthy volunteers (26 feet with a normal arch as the 
control group and 26 feet with dysmorphism [13 flat feet and 13 hollow feet]) 
were included. Strain-gauge plethysmography was performed 8 cm above the medial 
malleolus at different conditions of PVP stimulation: (1) toe flexion, (2) 
intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) with and without an insole, and (3) 
3-km/h speed walking on a treadmill barefoot, with shoes, and with shoes and 
insoles. From the strain-gauge plethysmography, we measured the venous blood 
ejection fraction (EF). From the pressure sensor placed at the midfoot on the 
plantar arch during IPC, we obtained the maximal pressure (N/cm2).
RESULTS: Toe flexion allowed for ejection of an average of 20% of the total 
venous volume in both groups. IPC and gait generated a mean EF superior to 100% 
of the available venous volume. The maximal pressure applied at the midfoot 
during IPC was lower than the pressure set. No significant differences in the EF 
or maximal pressure were observed between the two groups. The mean EF was not 
significantly affected for the pronator and supinator walkers compared with 
those with normal walking dynamics. Wearing shoes did not significantly affect 
the mean EF. However, wearing insoles during gait significantly increased the 
venous return in feet with plantar dysmorphism.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this clinical study is the first to 
assess the PVP function in 52 healthy volunteers with and without FSDs. We found 
that wearing shoes did not significantly affect PVP efficiency but that wearing 
morphologically adapted insoles significantly improved the venous return in the 
dysmorphic feet. In our sample of healthy volunteers, the differences observed 
between the control group and feet with FSDs were not statistically significant.

inclinations, and three different estimation strategies.

Inertial measurement units (IMU) constitute a light and cost-effective 
alternative to gold-standard measurement systems in the assessment of running 
temporal variables. IMU data collected on 20 runners running at different speeds 
(80, 90, 100, 110 and 120% of preferred running speed) and treadmill inclination 
(±2, ±5, and ±8%) were used here to predict the following temporal variables: 
stride frequency, duty factor, and two indices of running variability such as 
the detrended fluctuation analysis alpha (DFA-α) and the Higuchi's D (HG-D). 
Three different estimation methodologies were compared: 1) a gold-standard 
optoelectronic device (which provided the reference values), 2) IMU placed on 
the runner's feet, 3) a single IMU on the runner's thorax used in conjunction 
with a machine learning algorithm with a short 2-second or a long 120-second 
window as input. A two-way ANOVA was used to test the presence of significant 
(p<0.05) differences due to the running condition or to the estimation 
methodology. The findings of this study suggest that using both IMU 
configurations for estimating stride frequency can be effective and comparable 
to the gold-standard. Additionally, the results indicate that the use of a 
single IMU on the thorax with a machine learning algorithm can lead to more 
accurate estimates of duty factor than the strategy of the IMU on the feet. 
However, caution should be exercised when using these techniques to measure 
running variability indices. Estimating DFA-α from a short 2-second time window 
was possible only in level running but not in downhill running and it could not 
accurately estimate HG-D across all running conditions. By taking a long 
120-second window a machine learning algorithm could improve the accuracy in the 
estimation of DFA-α in all running conditions. By taking these factors into 
account, researchers and practitioners can make informed decisions about the use 
of IMU technology in measuring running biomechanics.

Adaptive walking assistance does not impact long-range stride-to-stride 
autocorrelations in healthy people.

Many studies have demonstrated in the past that the level of long-range 
autocorrelations in series of stride durations, characterizing natural gait 
variability, is impacted by external constraints, such as treadmill or 
metronome, or by pathologies, such as Parkinson's or Huntington's disease. 
Nevertheless, no one has analyzed the effects on this metric of a gait 
constrained by a robot-mediated walking assistance, which intrinsically tends to 
normalize the gait pattern. This paper focuses on the influence of a wearable 
active pelvis orthosis on the level of long-range autocorrelations in series of 
stride durations. Ten healthy participants, aged between 55 and 77 yr, performed 
four overground walking sessions, wearing this orthosis, and with different 
assistive parameters. This study showed that the adaptive assistance provided by 
this device has the potential of improving gait metrics that are typically 
affected by aging, such as the hip range of motion, walking speed, stride 
length, and stride duration, without impacting natural gait variability, i.e., 
the level of long-range autocorrelations in series of stride durations. This 
combination is virtuous toward the design of an assistive device for people with 
locomotion disorders resulting in deteriorated levels of long-range 
autocorrelations, such as patients with Parkinson's disease.NEW & NOTEWORTHY 
This study is the first that investigates the effects of a wearable active 
pelvis orthosis using an oscillator-based adaptive assistance on the level of 
long-range autocorrelations in series of stride durations during overground 
walking. It is also the first to compare the effects of different assistance 
settings on spatiotemporal gait metrics.

Peripheral nerve injury causes long-term motor dysfunction. Ultrasound (US) 
therapy is expected to accelerate peripheral nerve regeneration. However, its 
optimal usage and effects on macrophage phenotypes during peripheral nerve 
regeneration remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the optimal duration 
of US therapy and its effects on macrophage phenotype. Twenty-seven rats with 
autologous sciatic nerve grafting were divided into three groups: two received 
US therapy (1 MHz frequency, intensity of 140 mW/cm2, 20% duty cycle, 5 min/day) 
for one (US1) or 4 weeks (US4), and one group received sham stimulation. 
Immunohistochemistry was performed 3 and 7 days after injury in another set of 
12 rats. Eight weeks after the injury, the compound muscle action potential 
amplitude of the gastrocnemius in the US1 and US4 groups was significantly 
higher than that in the sham group. The toe-spreading test showed functional 
recovery, whereas the gait pattern during treadmill walking did not recover. 
There were no significant differences in motor function, histomorphometry, or 
muscle weight between groups. Immunohistochemistry showed that US therapy 
decreased the number of pro-inflammatory macrophages seven days after injury. 
Therefore, US therapy for both one or 4 weeks can similarly promote 
reinnervation and reduce proinflammatory macrophages in autograft model rats.

Slowing the decline in walking mobility in the elderly is critical for 
maintaining the quality of life. Wearable assistive devices may 1 day facilitate 
mobility in older adults; however, we need to ensure that such devices do not 
impair stability in this population that is predisposed to fall-related 
injuries. This study sought to quantify the effects of untethered ankle 
exoskeleton assistance on measures of stability, whole-body dynamics, and 
strategies to maintain balance during normal and perturbed walking in older 
adults. Eight healthy participants (69-84 years) completed a treadmill-based 
walking protocol that included perturbations from unexpected belt accelerations 
while participants walked with and without ankle exoskeleton assistance. 
Exoskeleton assistance increased frontal plane range of angular momentum (8-14%, 
p ≤ 0.007), step width (18-34%, p ≤ 0.006), and ankle co-contraction (21-29%, 
p ≤ 0.039), and decreased biological ankle moment (16-27%, p ≤ 0.001) during 
unperturbed and perturbed walking; it did not affect the anteroposterior 
margin-of-stability, step length, trunk variability, or soleus activity during 
unperturbed and perturbed walking. Our finding that ankle exoskeleton assistance 
did not affect the anteroposterior margin-of-stability supports additional 
investigation of assistive exoskeletons for walking assistance in the elderly.

during walking.

BACKGROUND: The gait pattern of adults with class I obesity [30 ≤ body mass 
index < 35kg/m2] was characterized by altered three-dimensional ground reaction 
force signals compared to lean adults (18.5 ≤ body mass index < 25 kg/m2). 
However, results might not be generalizable to adults with severe obesity (class 
II and III; body mass index ≥ 35 kg/m2). Hence, the purpose of the present study 
was to investigate the differences in relative ground reaction force signals, 
i.e., normalized by body weight, between adults with severe obesity and lean 
adults using functional principal component analysis.
METHODS: Thirteen lean and eighteen sedentary adults with severe obesity 
performed a 5-min walking trial (1.11 m/s) on an instrumented treadmill. The 
first five functional principal components of the relative force signals 
(mediolateral, anterior-posterior, and vertical directions) were obtained using 
functional principal component analysis. Functional principal component scores 
were compared between groups using an analysis of covariance with age as 
covariable.
FINDINGS: Functional principal component analysis reported a statistically 
significant group effect for first functional principal component score for 
mediolateral (P = 0.004), and second and fifth functional principal component 
scores for anterior-posterior (P ≤ 0.02) force signals. Adults with severe 
obesity displayed a greater mediolateral force during most of the stance but 
similar magnitudes of the anterior-posterior and vertical forces compared to 
lean adults.
INTERPRETATION: Therefore, increasing the obesity level accentuates differences 
in mediolateral force but promotes no specific changes in anterior-posterior 
force likely due to chronic loading adaptation.

INTRODUCTION: Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be used to 
quantify stump oxygen saturation (SaO2) as one of many possible causes of pain 
following major amputation. Although commonly used for cerebral perfusion 
monitoring during carotid or cardiac surgery, it can also be used to monitor 
tissue perfusion in the lower limb and predict healing following below knee 
amputation (BKA). The aim of this study was to measure the SaO2 trend as there 
is no validated oxygen threshold to diagnose insufficient flow into the arterial 
collateral network currently.
REPORT: NIRS was used to measure SaO2 while performing treadmill exercise. Two 
BKA patients with chronic stump pain were asked to perform treadmill exercise 
while using their prosthesis and NIRS optode applied to the posterior stump to 
monitor SaO2. Cases 1 and 2 showed a decline in SaO2 of 25% and 18%, 
respectively, while walking on the prosthesis. After superficial femoral artery 
(SFA) recanalisation and stenting, Case 1 showed improvement by maintaining SaO2 
between 54% and 60% throughout treadmill exercise. In Case 2, perfusion could 
not be further improved, and the patient underwent through knee amputation.
DISCUSSION: fNIRS detected compressive ischaemia and exercise induced ischaemia 
as mechanisms of stump pain. Findings provided the multidisciplinary team with 
objective information, aiding decision making to treat stump pain.

BACKGROUND: Asymmetric walking gait impairs activities of daily living in 
neurological patient populations, increases their fall risk, and leads to 
comorbidities. Accessible, long-term rehabilitation methods are needed to help 
neurological patients restore symmetrical walking patterns. This study aimed to 
determine if a passive unilateral hip exosuit can modify an induced asymmetric 
walking gait pattern. We hypothesized that a passive hip exosuit would diminish 
initial- and post-split-belt treadmill walking after-effects in healthy young 
adults.
METHODS: We divided 15 healthy young adults evenly between three experimental 
groups that each completed a baseline trial, an adaptation period with different 
interventions for each group, and a post-adaptation trial. To isolate the 
contribution of the exosuit we compared a group adapting to the exosuit and 
split-belt treadmill (Exo-Sb) to groups adapting to exosuit-only (Exo-only) and 
split-belt only (Sb-only) conditions. The independent variables step length, 
stance time, and swing time symmetry were analyzed across five timepoints 
(baseline, early- and late adaptation, and early- and late post-adaptation) 
using a 3 × 5 mixed ANOVA.
RESULTS: We found significant interaction and time effects on step length, 
stance time and swing time symmetry. Sb-only produced increased step length 
asymmetry at early adaptation compared to baseline (p < 0.0001) and an 
after-effect with increased asymmetry at early post-adaptation compared to 
baseline (p < 0.0001). Exo-only increased step length asymmetry (in the opposite 
direction as Sb-only) at early adaptation compared to baseline (p = 0.0392) but 
did not influence the participants sufficiently to result in a post-effect. 
Exo-Sb produced similar changes in step length asymmetry in the same direction 
as Sb-only (p = 0.0014). However, in contrast to Sb-only there was no 
significant after-effect between early post-adaptation and baseline 
(p = 0.0885).
CONCLUSION: The passive exosuit successfully diminished asymmetrical step length 
after-effects induced by the split-belt treadmill in Exo-Sb. These results 
support the passive exosuit's ability to alter walking gait patterns.

This study aimed to investigate whether sample entropy (SEn) and peak frequency 
values observed in treadmill walking could provide physical therapists valuable 
insights into gait rehabilitation following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). It 
was recognized that identifying movement strategies that during rehabilitation 
are initially adaptive but later start to hamper full recovery is critical to 
meet the clinical goals and minimize the risk of contralateral TKA. Eleven TKA 
patients were asked to perform clinical walking tests and a treadmill walking 
task at four different points in time (pre-TKA, 3, 6, and 12 months post-TKA). 
Eleven healthy peers served as the reference group. The movements of the legs 
were digitized with inertial sensors and SEn and peak frequency of the recorded 
rotational velocity-time functions were analyzed in the sagittal plane. SEn 
displayed a systematic increase during recovery in TKA patients (p < 0.001). 
Furthermore, lower peak frequency (p = 0.01) and sample entropy (p = 0.028) were 
found during recovery for the TKA leg. Movement strategies that initially are 
adaptive, and later hamper recovery, tend to diminish after 12 months post-TKA. 
It is concluded that inertial-sensor-based SEn and peak frequency analyses of 
treadmill walking enrich the assessment of movement rehabilitation after TKA.

Numerous applications exist for monitoring knee contact force (KCF) throughout 
activities of daily living. However, the ability to estimate these forces is 
restricted to a laboratory setting. The purposes of this study are to develop 
KCF metric estimation models and explore the feasibility of monitoring KCF 
metrics via surrogate measures derived from force-sensing insole data. Nine 
healthy subjects (3F, age 27 ± 5 years, mass 74.8 ± 11.8 kg, height 1.7 ± 0.08 
m) walked at multiple speeds (0.8-1.6 m/s) on an instrumented treadmill. 
Thirteen insole force features were calculated as potential predictors of peak 
KCF and KCF impulse per step, estimated with musculoskeletal modeling. The error 
was calculated with median symmetric accuracy. Pearson product-moment 
correlation coefficients defined the relationship between variables. Models 
develop per-limb demonstrated lower prediction error than those developed 
per-subject (KCF impulse: 2.2% vs 3.4%; peak KCF: 3.50% vs. 6.5%, respectively). 
Many insole features are moderately to strongly associated with peak KCF, but 
not KCF impulse across the group. We present methods to directly estimate and 
monitor changes in KCF using instrumented insoles. Our results carry promising 
implications for internal tissue loads monitoring outside of a laboratory with 
wearable sensors.

This study aimed to assess the association between the degree of varus thrust 
(VT) assessed by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and patient-reported outcome 
measures (PROMs) in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Seventy patients (mean 
age: 59.8 ± 8.6 years; women: n = 40) were instructed to walk on a treadmill 
with an IMU attached to the tibial tuberosity. For the index of VT during 
walking (VT-index), the swing-speed adjusted root mean square of acceleration in 
the mediolateral direction was calculated. As the PROMs, the Knee Injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score were used. Data on age, sex, body mass index, 
static alignment, central sensitization, and gait speed were collected as 
potential confounders. After adjusting for potential confounders, multiple 
linear regression analysis revealed that the VT-index was significantly 
associated with the pain score (standardized β = -0.295; p = 0.026), symptoms 
score (standardized β = -0.287; p = 0.026), and activities of the daily living 
score (standardized β = -0.256; p = 0.028). Our results indicated that larger VT 
values during gait are associated with worse PROMs, suggesting that an 
intervention to reduce VT might be an option for clinicians trying to improve 
PROMs.

The dynamic visual acuity test (DVAT) is a functional evaluation tool for the 
impairment and compensation of the vestibular system, which could reflect the 
Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) function. We present an overview of DVAT research, 
displaying recent advances in test methods, application, and influencing 
factors; and discussing the clinical value of DVAT to provide a reference for 
clinical application. There are two primary types of DVAT: dynamic-object DVAT 
and static-object DVAT. For the latter, in addition to the traditional bedside 
DVAT, there are numerous other approaches, including Computerized DVAT (cDVAT), 
DVAT on a treadmill, DVAT on a rotary, head thrust DVA (htDVA) and functional 
head impulse testing (fHIT), gaze shift dynamic visual acuity with walking 
(gsDVA), translational dynamic visual acuity test (tDVAT), pediatric DVAT. The 
results of DAVT are affected by subject [occupation, static visual acuity (SVA), 
age, eyeglass lenses], testing methods, caffeine, and alcohol. DVAT has numerous 
clinical applications, such as screening for vestibular impairment, assessing 
vestibular rehabilitation, predicting fall risk, and evaluating 
ophthalmology-related disorders, vestibular disorders, and central system 
disorders.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
degradation of the myelin sheath resulting in impaired neural communication 
throughout the body. As a result, most people with MS (PwMS) experience gait 
asymmetries between their legs leading to an increased risk of falls. Recent 
work indicates that split-belt treadmill adaptation, where the speed of each leg 
is controlled independently, can decrease gait asymmetries for other 
neurodegenerative impairments. The purpose of this study was to test the 
efficacy of split-belt treadmill training to improve gait symmetry in PwMS. In 
this study, 35 PwMS underwent a 10 min split-belt treadmill adaptation paradigm, 
with the faster paced belt moving under the more affected limb. Step length 
asymmetry (SLA) and phase coordination index (PCI) were the primary outcome 
measures used to assess spatial and temporal gait symmetries, respectively. It 
was predicted that participants with a worse baseline symmetry would have a 
greater response to split-belt treadmill adaptation. Following this adaptation 
paradigm, PwMS experienced aftereffects that improved gait symmetry, with a 
significant difference between predicted responders and nonresponders in both 
SLA and PCI change (p < 0.001). Additionally, there was no correlation between 
SLA and PCI change. These findings suggest that PwMS retain the ability for gait 
adaptation, with those most asymmetrical at baseline demonstrating the greatest 
improvement, and that there may be separate neural mechanisms for spatial and 
temporal locomotor adjustments.

The mechanisms by which physical exercise benefits brain functions are not fully 
understood. Here, we show that vertically oscillating head motions mimicking 
mechanical accelerations experienced during fast walking, light jogging or 
treadmill running at a moderate velocity reduce the blood pressure of rats and 
human adults with hypertension. In hypertensive rats, shear stresses of less 
than 1 Pa resulting from interstitial-fluid flow induced by such passive head 
motions reduced the expression of the angiotensin II type-1 receptor in 
astrocytes in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, and the resulting 
antihypertensive effects were abrogated by hydrogel introduction that inhibited 
interstitial-fluid movement in the medulla. Our findings suggest that 
oscillatory mechanical interventions could be used to elicit antihypertensive 
effects.

Peak tibial accelerations (TAs) during running are strongly related to early 
stance vertical ground reaction forces (GRFs), which are associated with 
musculoskeletal injury. However, few studies have examined these correlations 
during walking, and none have evaluated them during walking with loads, a 
relevant activity for military personnel. Our purpose was to determine the 
relationships between GRFs and TAs in US Army trainees (n = 649) walking with 
loads. An inertial measurement unit was attached over their distal antero-medial 
tibia. Participants walked on an instrumented treadmill at 1.21-1.34 m/s, with a 
pack loaded with 18.1 kg, for a 3-min warm-up followed by a minimum of 14 
strides of data collection. Simple linear regression models were calculated for 
peak vertical and resultant TAs with vertical and posterior GRF loading rates 
and peak forces. The strongest relationships were between vertical loading rates 
and peak vertical TA (R = 0.43-0.50), however the relationships were weaker than 
has been reported for unloaded walking and running (R > 0.7). All other 
relationships were trivial to small (R = 0.06-0.27). The weaker relationships 
for vertical GRFs and TAs may be due to methodological differences between 
studies, or differences in gait mechanics, such as a longer double-limb support 
phase in loaded vs. unloaded walking.

[Purpose] Humans keep their trunks vertical while walking. This defining 
characteristic is known as upright bipedalism. Research on the neural control of 
locomotion indicates that not only subcortical structures, but also the cerebral 
cortex, especially the supplementary motor area (SMA), is involved in 
locomotion. A previous study suggested that SMA may contribute to truncal 
upright posture-control during walking. Trunk Solution® (TS) is a trunk orthosis 
designed to support the trunk in decreasing the low back load. We hypothesized 
that the trunk orthosis might reduce the burden of truncal control on the SMA. 
The objective of this study was, therefore, to determine the effect of trunk 
orthosis on the SMA during walking. [Participants and Methods] Thirteen healthy 
participants were enrolled in the study. We measured the hemodynamics of the SMA 
during walking with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The 
participants performed two gait tasks on a treadmill: (A) independent gait 
(usual gait) and (B) supported gait while wearing the TS. [Results] During (A) 
independent gait, the hemodynamics of the SMA exhibited no significant changes. 
During (B) gait with truncal support, the SMA hemodynamics decreased 
significantly. [Conclusion] TS may reduce the burden of truncal control on the 
SMA during walking.

Gait training with rhythmic auditory cues contains motor learning mechanisms 
that are weighted more explicitly than implicitly. However, various clinical 
populations may benefit from a shift to gait training with greater implicit 
motor learning mechanisms. To investigate the ability to incorporate more 
implicit-weighted motor learning processes during rhythmic auditory cueing, we 
attempted to induce error-based recalibration using a subtly varying metronome 
cue for naïve unimpaired young adults. We assessed the extent of implicit and 
explicit retention after both an isochronous metronome and subtly varying 
metronome frequency during treadmill and overground walking. Despite 90% of 
participants remaining unaware of the changing metronome frequency, participants 
adjusted their cadence and step length to the subtly changing metronome, both on 
a treadmill and overground (p < 0.05). However, despite evidence of both 
implicit and explicit processes involved with each metronome (i.e., isochronous 
and varying), there were no between-condition differences in implicit or 
explicit retention for cadence, step length, or gait speed, and thus no 
increased implicit learning advantage with the addition of error-based 
recalibration for young, unimpaired adults.

OBJECTIVE: Randomized evidence comparing the cardiovascular effects of surgical 
and conservative weight management is lacking.
PATIENTS & METHODS: In this single-center, open-label randomized trial, obese 
patients with indication for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and able to perform 
treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) were included. After a 
6-12 month run-in phase of multimodal anti-obesity treatment, patients were 
randomized to RYGB or psychotherapy-enhanced lifestyle intervention (PELI) and 
co-primary endpoints were assessed 12 months later. Thereafter, PELI patients 
could opt for surgery and patients were reassessed 24 months after 
randomization. Co-primary endpoints were mean change (95 % confidence intervals) 
in peak VO2 (ml/min/kg body weight) in CPET and the physical functioning scale 
(PFS) of the Short Form health survey (SF-36).
RESULTS: Of 93 patients entering the study, 60 were randomized. Among these 
(median age 38 years; 88 % women; mean BMI 48·2 kg/m2), 46 (RYGB: 22 and PELI: 
24) were evaluated after 12 months. Total weight loss was 34·3 % after RYGB vs. 
1·2 % with PELI, while peak VO2 increased by +4·3 ml/min/kg (2·7, 5·9) vs 
+1·1 ml/min/kg (-0·2, 2·3); p < 0·0001. Respective improvement in PFS score was 
+40 (30, 49) vs +10 (1, 15); p < 0·0001. 6-minute walking distance also favored 
the RYGB group: +44 m (17, 72) vs +6 m (-14, 26); p < 0·0001. Left ventricular 
mass decreased after RYGB, but not with PELI: -32 g (-46, -17) vs 0 g (-13,13); 
p < 0·0001. In the non-randomized follow-up, 34 patients were assessed. 
Favorable changes were sustained in the RYGB group and were repeated in the 15 
evaluated patients that opted for surgery after PELI.
CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with severe obesity, RYGB in comparison to PELI 
resulted in improved cardiopulmonary capacity and quality of life. The observed 
effect sizes suggest that these changes are clinically relevant.

BACKGROUND: Walking requires constant adjustments to the changing environment. 
An asymmetrical perturbation can affect the gait symmetry, cause gait 
adaptations, and potentially induce retention of the adapted gait after removal 
of the perturbation. A unilateral ankle load has the potential to create 
asymmetry and facilitate the emergence of new gait patterns. However, few 
studies have examined the effect of unilateral loading on muscular adjustments 
during walking. The purpose of this study was to investigate gait adaptations 
and muscular adjustments after unilaterally loading or unloading the ankle.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the effects of unilateral loading and unloading on 
gait spatiotemporal parameters and muscle activation in young adults?
METHODS: Twenty young adults (10 M/10 F) walked on a treadmill at their 
preferred walking speeds in 3 conditions: 1) a 2-minute baseline trial; 2) three 
5-minute trials with a load (3 % of bodyweight) on the dominant ankle (Loading); 
and 3) one 5-minute trial with the load removed (Unloading). Inertial 
measurement units (IMUs) and electromyography sensors (EMGs) were used for data 
collection. Early and late adaptation and post-adaptation were assessed using 
the first 5 strides and the last 30 strides of loading and unloading conditions. 
Outcome measures included symmetry index (SI) of spatiotemporal parameters, 
range-of-motion (ROM) of the lower body joints, and EMG integrals of leg 
muscles. Repeated measures ANOVA was conducted for statistical analysis 
(α = 0.05).
RESULTS: SI of swing phase percentage demonstrated rapid adaptation after 
unilateral loading or unloading. Stride length demonstrated an aftereffect 
following unloading. Young adults reduced ankle ROMs bilaterally in early 
adaptation and increased loaded-side knee and hip ROMs in late adaptation. 
Additionally, they increased the tibialis anterior activity bilaterally 
immediately after unilateral loading.
SIGNIFICANCE: Young adults showed an aftereffect in some variables after 
unilateral unloading, signifying that unilateral ankle loading can induce short 
term learning of a new gait pattern.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease is common and associated with increased 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. While patients with peripheral arterial 
disease are known to benefit from supervised exercise therapy, it is not always 
available. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation devices may offer a similar 
benefit. A randomised controlled trial was required to ascertain whether such 
devices can benefit patients who receive supervised exercise therapy and those 
who do not.
OBJECTIVE(S): The primary objective was to assess the mean difference in 
absolute walking distance at 3 months in intermittent claudication patients 
receiving either a neuromuscular electrical stimulation device and local 
standard care (intervention), or local standard care alone (control).
DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial stratified by 
centre.
SETTING: Secondary-care National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥18 years, with a diagnosis of intermittent 
claudication according to the Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire and 
ankle–brachial pressure index (or stress test), without contraindications to 
neuromuscular electrical stimulation were deemed eligible to partake.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised 1 : 1 to either local standard care 
or local standard care and neuromuscular electrical stimulation. Due to the 
nature of the intervention, it was unfeasible to blind the research nurse or 
participant to the study allocation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was absolute walking distance 
measured by treadmill testing at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included change in 
initial claudication distance, quality of life, compliance with interventions 
and haemodynamic assessments.
RESULTS: Two hundred patients underwent randomisation, with 160 patients having 
analysable primary outcome data for the intention-to-treat analysis intervention 
(n = 80); control (n = 80). As the data were right-censored, a Tobit regression 
model was used to analyse the primary outcome, utilising the square root of the 
absolute walking distance to accommodate the skewed data. However, as this made 
the data difficult to interpret, a Tobit regression model using raw absolute 
walking distance data was used as well. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation 
improved the difference in absolute walking distance at 3 months but this was 
not statistically significant (square root of absolute walking distance: 0.835 
units, 95% confidence interval −0.67 to 2.34 units; p = 0.28/absolute walking 
distance raw data: 27.18 m, 95% confidence interval −26.92 to 81.28 m; p = 
0.323). Supervised exercise therapy participants showed a markedly improved 
absolute walking distance compared with patients receiving best medical therapy 
only at 3 months (square root of absolute walking distance: 3.295 units 95% 
confidence interval 1.77 to 4.82; p < 0.001/absolute walking distance raw data: 
121.71 m, 95% confidence interval 67.32 to 176.10; p ≤ 0.001). Neuromuscular 
electrical stimulation significantly improved absolute walking distance at 3 
months for mild claudicants (square root of absolute walking distance: 2.877 
units, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 5.25; p = 0.019/absolute walking distance 
raw data: 120.55 m, 95% confidence interval 16.03 to 225.06; p = 0.03) compared 
to the control arm. This was an unplanned (post hoc) analysis. There were no 
clear differences in mechanistic measurements between the two treatment groups 
over the follow-up period. Serious adverse events were evenly reported between 
the two groups; all being classified as either not related or unlikely to be 
related to the study device.
LIMITATIONS: Absolute walking distance was used as the primary outcome measure; 
there was a large range of baseline distances in both groups with right-skewed 
distribution. We did not stratify by baseline absolute walking distance for the 
primary outcome analysis. Additionally, only 160 patients had analysable primary 
outcome data due to missing treadmill data.
CONCLUSIONS: Supervised exercise therapy is an effective treatment for 
intermittent claudication. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation appears to be 
beneficial as an adjunct to supervised exercise therapy and on its own in mild 
claudicants.
FUTURE WORK: Further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of 
neuromuscular electrical stimulation in combination with supervised exercise 
therapy, and in mild to moderate claudicants in a larger sample size.
STUDY REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISRCTN18242823.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) 
Programme, a Medical Research Council (MRC) and National Institute for Health 
and Care Research (NIHR) partnership (project number 15/180/68). This will be 
published in full in Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation; Vol. 10, No. 2. See the 
NIHR Journals Library website for further project information. Infrastructure 
support for this research was provided by the NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research 
Centre (BRC) (with others, e.g. NIHR Imperial CRF, Imperial College ECMC, NIHR 
Imperial PSTRC, NIHR London MIC, etc.).

Plain Language Summary: WHY DID WE CONDUCT THIS RESEARCH? Patients with 
intermittent claudication present with pain in the lower limbs on exercising, 
relieved by rest. This negatively impacts on exercise tolerance and quality of 
life. Initially, such patients should be offered best medical therapy, including 
exercise advice, and a supervised exercise therapy programme. Supervised 
exercise therapy involves leg and feet exercises supervised by health-care 
professionals and, despite evidence favouring supervised versus unsupervised 
exercise, are underutilised in the United Kingdom. Therefore, there remains a 
significant difference between recommended standard care (best medical therapy 
and supervised exercise therapy) and ‘real-world’ standard care (best medical 
therapy only). Neuromuscular electrical stimulation devices have emerged as 
safe, portable and readily accessible, with some evidence suggesting they can 
improve outcomes, including pain-free walking distance and quality of life. This 
study investigated whether a neuromuscular electrical stimulation device 
improved the walking distance of patients with intermittent claudication 
compared to local standard care available (which may include supervised exercise 
therapy).
WHAT DID WE DO? Two hundred patients diagnosed with intermittent claudication at 
11 hospitals in England took part. A computer program randomly assigned half the 
patients to local standard care only, while the other half were given a 
neuromuscular electrical stimulation device which delivers electrical 
stimulation to leg and feet muscles through foot-pads, plus local standard care.
WHAT DID WE FIND? There was no clear difference in maximal walking distances 
between those who received a device and those who didn’t. However, neuromuscular 
electrical stimulation improved walking distances in patients who attended a 
supervised exercise therapy programme (although not significant), and clearly 
improved walking distances in those patients with a good baseline upper walking 
limit. Supervised exercise therapy significantly improved walking distances.
WHAT COULD BE DONE NEXT? Future research studies should further evaluate the 
effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in combination with 
supervised exercise therapy, and in patients who have a good baseline walking 
distance in a larger sample of patients with intermittent claudication.

PURPOSE: In sky- and trail-running competitions, many athletes use poles. The 
aims of this study were to investigate whether the use of poles affects the 
force exerted on the ground at the feet (Ffoot), cardiorespiratory variables and 
maximal performance during uphill walking.
METHODS: Fifteen male trail runners completed four testing sessions on different 
days. On the first two days, they performed two incremental uphill treadmill 
walking tests to exhaustion with (PWincr) and without poles (Wincr). On the 
following days, they performed submaximal and maximal tests with (PW80 and 
PWmax) and without (W80 and Wmax) poles on an outdoor trail course. We measured 
cardiorespiratory parameters, the rating of perceived exertion, the axial poling 
force and Ffoot.
RESULTS: When walking on the treadmill, we found that poles reduced maximum 
Ffoot (- 2.8 ± 6.4%, p = 0.03) and average Ffoot (- 2.4 ± 3.3%, p = 0.0089). 
However, when outdoors, we found pole effect only for average Ffoot 
(p = 0.0051), which was lower when walking with poles (- 2.6 ± 3.9%, p = 0.0306 
during submaximal trial and - 5.21 ± 5.51%, p = 0.0096 during maximal trial). We 
found no effects of poles on cardiorespiratory parameters across all tested 
conditions. Performance was faster in PWmax than in Wmax (+ 2.5 ± 3.4%, 
p = 0.025).
CONCLUSION: The use of poles reduces the foot force both on the treadmill and 
outdoors at submaximal and maximal intensities. It is, therefore, reasonable to 
conclude that the use of poles ""saves the legs"" during uphill without affecting 
the metabolic cost.

BACKGROUND: Individualized, targeted, and intense training is the hallmark of 
successful gait rehabilitation in people post-stroke. Specifically, increasing 
use of the impaired ankle to increase propulsion during the stance phase of gait 
has been linked to higher walking speeds and symmetry. Conventional progressive 
resistance training is one method used for individualized and intense 
rehabilitation, but often fails to target paretic ankle plantarflexion during 
walking. Wearable assistive robots have successfully assisted ankle-specific 
mechanisms to increase paretic propulsion in people post-stroke, suggesting 
their potential to provide targeted resistance to increase propulsion, but this 
application remains underexamined in this population. This work investigates the 
effects of targeted stance-phase plantarflexion resistance training with a soft 
ankle exosuit on propulsion mechanics in people post-stroke.
METHODS: We conducted this study in nine individuals with chronic stroke and 
tested the effects of three resistive force magnitudes on peak paretic 
propulsion, ankle torque, and ankle power while participants walked on a 
treadmill at their comfortable walking speeds. For each force magnitude, 
participants walked for 1 min while the exosuit was inactive, 2 min with active 
resistance, and 1 min with the exosuit inactive, in sequence. We evaluated 
changes in gait biomechanics during the active resistance and post-resistance 
sections relative to the initial inactive section.
RESULTS: Walking with active resistance increased paretic propulsion by more 
than the minimal detectable change of 0.8 %body weight at all tested force 
magnitudes, with an average increase of 1.29 ± 0.37 %body weight at the highest 
force magnitude. This improvement corresponded to changes of 0.13 ± 0.03 N m 
kg- 1 in peak biological ankle torque and 0.26 ± 0.04 W kg- 1 in peak biological 
ankle power. Upon removal of resistance, propulsion changes persisted for 
30 seconds with an improvement of 1.49 ± 0.58 %body weight after the highest 
resistance level and without compensatory involvement of the unresisted joints 
or limb.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted exosuit-applied functional resistance of paretic ankle 
plantarflexors can elicit the latent propulsion reserve in people post-stroke. 
After-effects observed in propulsion highlight the potential for learning and 
restoration of propulsion mechanics. Thus, this exosuit-based resistive approach 
may offer new opportunities for individualized and progressive gait 
rehabilitation.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Low physical activity in patients with claudication 
is associated with lower walking abilities as assessed by the treadmill test. 
The impact of physical activity on the ability to walk in a natural environment 
is unknown. The study aimed to assess the level of daily physical activity among 
patients with claudication, as well as the relationship between the level of 
daily physical activity and claudication distance measured during the outdoor 
walking and treadmill tests.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 37 patients (24 males), aged 70.03±5.9, 
with intermittent claudication. Daily step count was assessed using the Garmin 
Vivofit activity monitor, worn on the non-dominant wrist for 7 consecutive days. 
Pain-free walking distance (PFWDTT) and maximal walking distance (MWDTT) were 
measured via the treadmill test. During 60-minute outdoor walking, the maximal 
walking distance (MWDGPS), total walking distance (TWDGPS), walking speed 
(WSGPS), number of stops (NSGPS) and stop durations (SDGPS) were assessed.
RESULTS: Mean daily step count - 7,102±3,433. A significant correlation was 
observed between daily step count and MWDTT, TWDGPS (R=0.33, R=0.37, 
respectively (p<0.05). Furthermore, 51% of patients reached less than 7,500 
steps/day and presented significantly shorter MWDTT, MWDGPS and TWDGPS, compared 
to the participants covering ≥7,500 steps (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The daily step count reflects claudication distance measured on a 
treadmill and only partially in a community outdoor setting. The minimal daily 
step count that should be recommended for patients with claudication, allowing 
achievement of significantly better results with regard to walking abilities, 
both on the treadmill and in outdoor settings, is at least 7,500 steps per day.

perception of visual stimuli, potentially making obstacle avoidance during 
walking more difficult and increasing fall risk. Recommendations on walking and 
mask wearing for older adults have been debated, with no clear consensus on the 
various factors interacting and influencing walking safety while wearing a face 
mask. It is particularly important to address this issue in populations at an 
increased risk of falls. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects 
of mask-wearing on objectively measured walking adaptability in people with 
Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis.
METHODS: 50 patients with either Parkinson's disease or Multiple Sclerosis 
attending inpatient neurorehabilitation will be recruited to participate in this 
crossover study. Performance during a standardized gait adaptability (C-Gait) 
test on a VR-based treadmill (C-Mill+VR), as well as during clinical mobility 
tests (10-meter walk test, Timed Up & Go test, and stair ambulation) will be 
measured with and without an FFP2- mask (order randomized). In addition, 
participants will be asked about their perceived performance and perceived 
safety during the tests with and without a mask. Performance on the seven C-Gait 
subtests is based on centre of pressure-derived measures of foot placement in 
relation to the different tasks. These are averaged and added to a cognitive 
C-Gait task to give the overall composite score (primary outcome). Secondary 
outcomes will include the different subscores and clinical mobility tests.
POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study will make an important contribution to an 
ongoing debate regarding recommendations persons with and without a neurological 
disease should be given regarding wearing a face mask while walking. 
Furthermore, the study will complement the existing scientific discourse with 
clinical data from people with a neurological disease for whom falls, mobility 
deficits and mask wearing may be more frequent, which can help inform 
evidence-based recommendations.

Spinal function is substantially related to the motion of the particular 
vertebrae and the spine as a whole. For systematic assessment of individual 
motion, data sets are required which cover the kinematics comprehensively. 
Additionally, the data should enable a comparison of inter- and intraindividual 
variation of vertebral orientation in dedicated motion tasks like gait. For this 
purpose, this article provides surface topography (ST) data which were acquired 
while the individual test persons were walking on a treadmill at three different 
speed levels (2 km/h, 3 km/h, 4 km/h). In each recording, ten full walking 
cycles were included per test case to enable a detailed analysis of motion 
patterns. The provided data reflects asymptomatic and pain-free volunteers. Each 
data set contains the vertebral orientation in all three motion directions for 
the vertebra prominens down to L4 as well as the pelvis. Additionally, spinal 
parameters like balance, slope, and lordosis / kyphosis parameters as well as an 
assignment of the motion data to single gait cycles are included. The complete 
raw data set without any preprocessing is provided. This allows to apply a broad 
range of further signal processing and evaluation steps in order to identify 
characteristic motion patterns as well as intra- and inter-individual variation 
of vertebral motion.

INTRODUCTION: The beneficial effects of physical exercise on functional capacity 
and inflammatory response are well-known in cardiovascular diseases; however, 
studies on sickle cell disease (SCD) are limited. It was hypothesized that 
physical exercise may exert a favorable effect on the inflammatory response of 
SCD patients, contributing to an improved quality of life. This study aimed to 
evaluate the effect of a regular physical exercise program on the 
anti-inflammatory responses in SCD patients.
METHODS: A non-randomized clinical trial was conducted in adult SCD patients. 
The patients were divided into two groups: 1-Exercise Group, which received a 
physical exercise program three times a week for 8 weeks, and; 2-Control Group, 
with routine physical activities. All patients underwent the following 
procedures initially and after eight weeks of protocol: clinical evaluation, 
physical evaluation, laboratory evaluation, quality of life evaluation, and 
echocardiographic evaluation.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Comparisons between groups were made using Student's 
t-test, Mann-Whitney test, chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test. Spearman's 
correlation coefficient was calculated. The significance level was set at p < 
0.05.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in inflammatory response between 
the Control and Exercise Groups. The Exercise Group showed an improvement in 
peak VO2 values (p < 0.001), an increase in the distance walked (p < 0.001), an 
improvement in the limitation domain due to the physical aspects of the 36-Item 
Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) quality of life questionnaire (p = 0.022), and 
an increase in physical activity related to leisure (p < 0.001) and walking (p = 
0.024) in the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). There was a 
negative correlation between IL-6 values and distance walked on the treadmill 
(correlation coefficient -0.444, p = 0.020) and the estimated peak VO2 values 
(correlation coefficient -0.480; p = 0.013) in SCD patients in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The aerobic exercise program did not change the inflammatory 
response profile of SCD patients, nor did it show unfavorable effects on the 
parameters evaluated, and patients with lower functional capacity were those 
with the highest levels of IL-6.

Temperature-Humidity-Dependent Wind Effects on Physiological Heat Strain of 
Moderately Exercising Individuals Reproduced by the Universal Thermal Climate 
Index (UTCI).

Increasing wind speed alleviates physiological heat strain; however, health 
policies have advised against using ventilators or fans under heat wave 
conditions with air temperatures above the typical skin temperature of 35 °C. 
Recent research, mostly with sedentary participants, suggests mitigating the 
effects of wind at even higher temperatures, depending on the humidity level. 
Our study aimed at exploring and quantifying whether such results are 
transferable to moderate exercise levels, and whether the Universal Thermal 
Climate Index (UTCI) reproduces those effects. We measured heart rates, core and 
skin temperatures, and sweat rates in 198 laboratory experiments completed by 
five young, semi-nude, heat-acclimated, moderately exercising males walking the 
treadmill at 4 km/h on the level for three hours under widely varying 
temperature-humidity combinations and two wind conditions. We quantified the 
cooling effect of increasing the wind speed from 0.3 to 2 m/s by fitting 
generalized additive models predicting the physiological heat stress responses 
depending on ambient temperature, humidity, and wind speed. We then compared the 
observed wind effects to the assessment performed by the UTCI. Increasing the 
wind speed lowered the physiological heat strain for air temperatures below 35 
°C, but also for higher temperatures with humidity levels above 2 kPa water 
vapor pressure concerning heart rate and core temperature, and 3 kPa concerning 
skin temperature and sweat rate, respectively. The UTCI assessment of wind 
effects correlated positively with the observed changes in physiological 
responses, showing the closest agreement (r = 0.9) for skin temperature and 
sweat rate, where wind is known for elevating the relevant convective and 
evaporative heat transfer. These results demonstrate the potential of the UTCI 
for adequately assessing sustainable strategies for heat stress mitigation 
involving fans or ventilators, depending on temperature and humidity, for 
moderately exercising individuals.

Introduction: This study investigated kinematic and EMG changes in gait across 
simulated gravitational unloading levels between 100% and 20% of normal body 
weight. This study sought to identify if each level of unloading elicited 
consistent changes-particular to that percentage of normal body weight-or if the 
changes seen with unloading could be influenced by the previous level(s) of 
unloading. Methods: 15 healthy adult participants (26.3 ± 2.5 years; 53% female) 
walked in an Alter-G anti-gravity treadmill unloading system (mean speed: 1.49 
±0.37 mph) for 1 min each at 100%, 80%, 60%, 40% and 20% of normal body weight, 
before loading back to 100% in reverse order. Lower-body kinematic data were 
captured by inertial measurement units, and EMG data were collected from the 
rectus femoris, biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, and anterior tibialis. 
Data were compared across like levels of load using repeated measures ANOVA and 
statistical parametric mapping. Difference waveforms for adjacent levels were 
created to examine the rate of change between different unloading levels. 
Results: This study found hip, knee, and ankle kinematics as well as activity in 
the rectus femoris, and medial gastrocnemius were significantly different at the 
same level of unloading, having arrived from a higher, or lower level of 
unloading. There were no significant changes in the kinematic difference 
waveforms, however the waveform representing the change in EMG between 100% and 
80% load was significantly different from all other levels. Discussion: This 
study found that body weight unloading from 100% to 20% elicited distinct 
responses in the medial gastrocnemius, as well as partly in the rectus femoris. 
Hip, knee, and ankle kinematics were also affected differentially by loading and 
unloading, especially at 40% of normal body weight. These findings suggest the 
previous level of gravitational load is an important factor to consider in 
determining kinematic and EMG responses to the current level during loading and 
unloading below standard g. Similarly, the rate of change in kinematics from 
100% to 20% appears to be linear, while the rate of change in EMG was 
non-linear. This is of particular interest, as it suggests that kinematic and 
EMG measures decouple with unloading and may react to unloading uniquely.

INTRODUCTION: Body weight support overground walking training (BWSOWT) is widely 
used in gait rehabilitation. However, existing systems require large workspace, 
complex structure, and substantial installation cost for the actuator, which 
make those systems inappropriate for the clinical environment. For wide clinical 
use, the proposed system is based on a self-paced treadmill, and uses an 
optimized body weight support with frame-based two-wire mechanism.
METHOD: The Interactive treadmill was used to mimic overground walking. We opted 
the conventional DC motors to partially unload the body weight and modified 
pelvic type harness to allow natural pelvic motion. The performance of the 
proposed system on the measurement of anterior/posterior position, force 
control, and pelvic motion was evaluated with 8 healthy subjects during walking 
training.
RESULTS: We verified that the proposed system was the cost/space-effective and 
showed the more accurate anterior/posterior position than motion sensor, 
comparable force control performance, and natural pelvic motion.
DISCUSSION: The proposed system is cost/space effective, and able to mimic 
overground walking training with body weight support. In future work, we will 
improve the force control performance and optimize the training protocol for 
wide clinical use.

Low-cost exoskeletons can effectively support workers in physically demanding 
jobs, but most such exoskeletons have been developed to support repetitive 
lifting or uncomfortable static postures. Very few low-cost exoskeletons have 
been designed to support walking while carrying heavy objects, which would be 
beneficial for jobs such as moving furniture and warehouse work. This paper thus 
presents a single-session lab evaluation of the Auxivo CarrySuit, a low-cost 
upper-body exoskeleton designed for carrying objects that would normally be held 
with the arms. Twenty participants carried four loads (box or two bags, 20 or 
40 lb total weight) for 2 min each on a treadmill with and without the 
CarrySuit. Across all loads, the CarrySuit significantly reduced the mean 
electromyogram of the middle trapezius (partial eta-squared = 0.74 - from 16.1% 
to 8.8% of maximum voluntary contraction value) and anterior deltoid (partial 
eta-squared = 0.26 - from 3.0% to 1.1% of maximum voluntary contraction value) 
with no corresponding increase in lower back muscle activation. Furthermore, 
maximum heart rate and Ratings of Perceived Exertion were also reduced by the 
CarrySuit, and discomfort was shifted from the upper body to the legs. While arm 
EMG was not measured, it is likely that it was also reduced due to the unloading 
of the arms. The CarrySuit can thus be considered beneficial in the short term, 
though longer-term evaluations with actual workers are needed to determine 
practical benefits.

Lower-body robotic exoskeletons can be used to reduce the energy demand of 
locomotion and increase the endurance of wearers. Understanding how motor 
fatigue affects walking performance may lead to better exoskeleton designs to 
support the changing physical capacity of an individual due to motor fatigue. 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of motor fatigue on 
walking mechanics and energetics. Treadmill walking with progressively increased 
incline gradient was used to induce motor fatigue. Twenty healthy young 
participants walked on an instrumented treadmill at 1.25 m/s and 0° of incline 
for 5 min before (PRE) and after (POST) motor fatigue. We examined lower-limb 
joint mechanics, metabolic cost, and the efficiency of positive mechanical work 
(η+work). Compared to PRE, participants had increased net metabolic power by 
∼14% (p < 0.001) during POST. Participants also had increased total-limb 
positive mechanical power (Total P+mech) by ∼4% during POST (p < 0.001), 
resulting in a reduced η+work by ∼8% (p < 0.001). In addition, the positive 
mechanical work contribution of the lower-limb joints during POST was shifted 
from the ankle to the knee while the negative mechanical work contribution was 
shifted from the knee to the ankle (all p < 0.017). Although greater knee 
positive mechanical power was generated to compensate for the reduction in ankle 
positive power after motor fatigue, the disproportionate increase in metabolic 
cost resulted in a reduced walking efficiency. The findings of this study 
suggest that powering the ankle joint may help delay the onset of the lower-limb 
joint work redistribution observed during motor fatigue.

Achilles tendon (AT) tendinopathy is common in runners. Repetitive AT loading 
may play a role in etiology. Interventions such as body weight support (BWS) may 
reduce loading on the AT in running. Examine how ground reaction force, AT 
loading, foot strike, and cadence variables change in running with BWS. 
Twenty-four healthy female runners free from injury were examined. Participants 
ran on an instrumented treadmill with and without BWS using a harness-based 
system at a standardized speed. The system has 4 elastic cords affixed to a 
harness that is attached to a frame-like structure. Kinematic data and kinetic 
data were used in a musculoskeletal model (18 segments and 16 degrees of 
freedom) to determine AT loading variables, foot strike angle, and cadence. 
Paired t-tests were used to compare each variable between conditions. Ground 
reaction force was 9.0% lower with BWS (p<.05). Peak AT stress, force, and 
impulse were 9.4, 11.7%, and 14.8% lower when using BWS in running compared to 
no support (p<.05). Foot strike angle was similar (p<.05) despite cadence being 
reduced (p<.05). BWS may reduce AT loading and impulse variables during running. 
This may be important in rehabilitation efforts.

BACKGROUND: Humans naturally transition from walking to running at a point known 
as the walk-to-run transition (WRT). The WRT commonly occurs at a speed of 
∼2.1 m/s (m/s) or a Froude number (dimensionless value considering leg length) 
of 0.5. Emerging evidence suggests the WRT can also be classified using a 
cadence of 140 steps/min. An accurate cadence-based WRT metric would aid in 
classifying wearable technology minute-level step metrics as walking vs. 
running.
PURPOSE: To evaluate performance of 1) WRT predictors directly identified from a 
treadmill-based dataset of sequentially faster bouts, and 2) accepted WRT 
predictors compiled from previous literature.
METHODS: Twenty-eight adults (71.4% men; age = 36.6 ± 12.8 years, 
BMI = 26.2 ± 4.7 kg/m2) completed a series of five-minute treadmill walking 
bouts increasing in 0.2 m/s increments until they freely chose to run. Optimal 
WRT values for speed, Froude number, and cadence were identified using receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. WRT value performance was 
evaluated via classification accuracy metrics.
RESULTS: Overall accuracies (metric, percent) according to WRT predictors from 
previous literature were: speed (2.1 m/s, 55.0%), Froude number (0.5, 76.8%), 
and cadence (140 steps/min, 91.1%), and those from the dataset herein were: 
speed (1.9 and 2.0 m/s, 78.6%), Froude number (0.68, 77.3%), and cadence (134, 
139, and 141 steps/min, 92.9%). The three equally accurate cadence values 
support a heuristic range of cadence-based WRT values in young and middle-aged 
adults: 135-140 steps/min.
SIGNIFICANCE: A tight range of cadence values performed better as WRT predictors 
compared to either previously reported or directly identified speed or Froude 
number values. These findings have important implications for gait 
classification, especially considering cadence is a simple metric which can be 
readily assessed across settings using direct observation or wearable 
technologies.

This study aims to investigate two simple algorithms for extracting gait 
features from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) based canine gait analysis 
system. The first algorithm was developed to determine the hip/shoulder 
extension/flexion range of motion. The second algorithm automatically determines 
the stance and swing phase per leg. To investigate the accuracy of the 
algorithms, two dogs were walked on a treadmill and measured simultaneously with 
an IMU system, an optical tracking system and two cameras. The range of motion 
estimation was compared to the optical tracking systems, with a total of 280 
steps recorded. To test the stance and swing phase detection, a total of 63 
steps were manually annotated in the video recordings and compared with the 
output of the algorithm. The IMU's-based estimation of the range of motion 
showed an average deviation of 1.4° to 5.6° from the optical reference, while 
the average deviation in the detection of the beginning and end of the stance 
and swing phases ranged from -0.01 to 0.09 s. This study shows that even simple 
algorithms can extract relevant information from inertial measurements that are 
comparable to results from more complex approaches. However, additional studies 
including a wider subject pool need to be conducted to investigate the 
significance of the presented findings.

Late-life balance disorders remain a severe problem with fatal consequences. 
Perturbation-based balance training (PBT), a form of rehabilitation that 
intentionally introduces small, unpredictable disruptions to an individual's 
gait cycle, can improve balance. The Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD) is a 
cable-driven robotic trainer that applies perturbations to the user's pelvis 
during treadmill walking. Earlier work showcased improved gait stability and the 
first evidence of increased cognition acutely. The mobile Tethered Pelvic Assist 
Device (mTPAD), a portable version of the TPAD, applies perturbations to a 
pelvic belt via a posterior walker during overground gait, as opposed to 
treadmill walking. Forty healthy older adults were randomly assigned to a 
control group (CG, n = 20) without mTPAD PBT or an experimental group (EG, n = 
20) with mTPAD PBT for a two-day study. Day 1 consisted of baseline 
anthropometrics, vitals, and functional and cognitive measurements. Day 2 
consisted of training with the mTPAD and post-interventional cognitive and 
functional measurements. Results revealed that the EG significantly outperformed 
the CG in cognitive and functional tasks while showcasing increased confidence 
in mobility. Gait analysis demonstrated that the mTPAD PBT significantly 
improved mediolateral stability during lateral perturbations. To our knowledge, 
our study is the first randomized, large group (n = 40) clinical study exploring 
new mobile perturbation-based robotic gait training technology.

BACKGROUND: Footwear has been shown to influence balance and is an important 
consideration in relation to the prevention of falls. However, it remains 
unclear as to what type of footwear is most beneficial for balance in older 
people: sturdy, supportive footwear, or minimalist footwear to maximise plantar 
sensory input. The objectives of this study were therefore to compare standing 
balance and walking stability in older women wearing these two footwear styles, 
and to investigate participants' perceptions in relation to comfort, ease of use 
and fit.
METHODS: Older women (n = 20) aged 66 to 82 years (mean 73.4, SD 3.9) performed 
a series of laboratory tests of standing balance (eyes open and closed on floor 
and foam rubber mat, near tandem standing) and walking stability (treadmill, 
level and irregular surface) using a wearable sensor motion analysis system. 
Participants were tested wearing supportive footwear (incorporating design 
features to improve balance) and minimalist footwear. Perceptions of the 
footwear were documented using structured questionnaires.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in balance 
performance between the supportive and minimalist footwear. Participants 
perceived the supportive footwear to be significantly more attractive to self 
and others, easier to put on and off but heavier compared to the minimalist 
footwear. Overall comfort was similar between the footwear conditions, although 
the supportive footwear was reported to be significantly more comfortable in the 
heel, arch height, heel cup, heel width and forefoot width regions. Eighteen 
participants (90%) reported that they felt more stable in the supportive 
footwear and 17 (85%) reported that they would consider wearing them to reduce 
their risk of falling.
CONCLUSION: Balance performance and walking stability were similar in supportive 
footwear designed to reduce the risk of falling and minimalist footwear, 
although participants preferred the supportive footwear in relation to 
aesthetics, ease of use, comfort and perceived stability. Prospective studies 
are now required to ascertain the longer-term advantages and disadvantages of 
these footwear styles on comfort and stability in older people.

commercially available if the company believes there is a sufficient market for 
them. No commercial arrangements or royalty agreements have been made, as this 
is an early proof-of-principle study. However, there is a possibility that the 
researchers, in their capacity as staff members of La Trobe University, may 
obtain some commercial benefit if the footwear reaches the market in the future.

BACKGROUND: The gait cycle is generally divided into stance phase and swing 
phase. The stance phase can also be divided into three functional rockers, each 
with a distinct fulcrum. It has been shown that walking speed (WS) influences 
both stance and swing phase but its influence on the functional foot rockers 
duration is unknown. The aim of the study was to analyze the WS influence on 
functional foot rockers duration.
METHODS: a cross-sectional study is completed with 99 healthy volunteers to 
assess the effect of WS on kinematics and foot rockers duration in treadmill 
walking at 4, 5, and 6 km·h-1 RESULTS: Friedman test exhibited that all 
spatiotemporal variables and the length of the foot rockers changed 
significantly with WS (p < 0.05) except rocker 1 at 4 and 6 km·h-1.
CONCLUSION: Every spatiotemporal parameter and the duration of the three 
functional rockers are affected by walking speed, although not all rockers are 
affected equally. The findings of this study reveal that Rocker 2 is the primary 
rocker whose duration is influenced by changes in gait speed.

BACKGROUND: Footwear interventions are a potential avenue to correct walking 
asymmetry in neurologic populations, such as stroke. However, the motor learning 
mechanisms that underlie the changes in walking imposed by asymmetric footwear 
are unclear.
RESEARCH QUESTION: The objectives of this study were to examine symmetry changes 
during and after an asymmetric shoe height intervention in (1) vertical impulse 
and (2) spatiotemporal gait parameters and (3) joint kinematics, in healthy 
young adults METHODS: Eleven healthy young adults (3 males, 8 females; 
21.2 ± 3.1 years old) participated in this study. Participants walked on an 
instrumented treadmill at 1.3 m/s for four conditions: (1) a 5-minute 
familiarization with equal shoe height, (2) a 5-minute baseline with equal shoe 
height, (3) a 10-minute intervention, where participants walked with asymmetric 
shoe height with a 10 mm shoe insert in one shoe, and (4) a 10-minute 
post-intervention, where participants walked with equal shoe height. Asymmetry 
in kinetics and kinematics were used to identify changes during intervention and 
aftereffects, a hallmark of feedforward adaptation RESULTS: Participants did not 
alter vertical impulse asymmetry (p = 0.667) nor stance time asymmetry 
(p = 0.228). During the intervention, step time asymmetry (p = 0.003) and double 
support asymmetry (p < 0.001) were greater compared to baseline. Leg joint 
asymmetry during stance (Ankle plantarflexion: p < 0.001; Knee flexion: 
p < 0.001; Hip extension: p = 0.011) was greater during the intervention 
compared to baseline. However, changes in spatiotemporal gait variables and 
joint mechanics did not demonstrate aftereffects.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that healthy human adults change gait kinematics, 
but not weight-bearing symmetry with asymmetrical footwear. This suggests that 
healthy humans prioritize maintaining vertical impulse by changing their 
kinematics. Further, the changes in gait kinematics are short-lived, suggesting 
feedback-based control, and a lack of feedforward motor adaptations.

PURPOSE: To determine associations between immediate and delayed response of 
serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP) to loading (i.e., 3000 walking 
steps) and femoral cartilage interlimb T1ρ relaxation times in individual's 
post-anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 20 individuals 6-12 months 
following primary ACLR (65% female, 20.5 ± 4.0 years old, 24.9 ± 3.0 kg/m2, 
7.3 ± 1.5 months post-ACLR). Serum samples were collected prior to, immediately 
following, and 3.5 h following walking 3000 steps on a treadmill at habitual 
walking speed. sCOMP concentrations were processed using enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays. Immediate and delayed absolute sCOMP responses to loading 
were evaluated immediately and 3.5 h post-walking, respectively. Participants 
underwent bilateral magnetic resonance imaging with T1ρ sequences to calculate 
resting femoral cartilage interlimb T1ρ relaxation time ratios between limbs 
(i.e., ACLR/Uninjured limb). Linear regression models were fitted to determine 
associations between sCOMP response to loading and femoral cartilage T1ρ 
outcomes controlling for pre-loading sCOMP concentrations.
RESULTS: Greater increases in delayed sCOMP response to loading were associated 
with greater lateral (∆R2 = 0.29, p = 0.02) but not medial (∆R2 < 0.01, 
p = 0.99) femoral cartilage interlimb T1ρ ratios. Associations between immediate 
sCOMP response to loading with femoral cartilage interlimb T1ρ ratios were weak 
and non-significant (∆R2 range = 0.02-0.09, p range = 0.21-0.58).
CONCLUSION: Greater delayed sCOMP response to loading, a biomarker of cartilage 
breakdown, is associated with worse lateral femoral cartilage composition in the 
ACLR limb compared to the uninjured limb. Delayed sCOMP response to loading may 
be a more indicative metabolic indicator linked to deleterious changes in 
composition than immediate sCOMP response.

BACKGROUND: There is evidence that ambulatory people with incomplete spinal cord 
injury (iSCI) have an impaired ability to control lateral motion of their 
whole-body center of mass (COM) during walking. This impairment is believed to 
contribute to functional deficits in gait and balance, however that relationship 
is unclear. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the relationship between 
the ability to control lateral COM motion during walking and functional measures 
of gait and balance in people with iSCI.
METHODS: We assessed the ability to control lateral COM motion during walking 
and conducted clinical gait and balance outcome measures on 20 ambulatory adults 
with chronic iSCI (C1-T10 injury, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment 
Scale C or D). To assess their ability to control lateral COM motion, 
participants performed three treadmill walking trials. During each trial, 
real-time lateral COM position and a target lane were projected on the 
treadmill. Participants were instructed to keep their lateral COM position 
within the lane. If successful, an automated control algorithm progressively 
reduced the lane width, making the task more challenging. If unsuccessful, the 
lane width increased. The adaptive lane width was designed to challenge each 
participant's maximum capacity to control lateral COM motion during walking. To 
quantify control of lateral COM motion, we calculated lateral COM excursion 
during each gait cycle and then identified the minimum lateral COM excursion 
occurring during five consecutive gait cycles. Our clinical outcome measures 
were Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go test (TUG), 10-Meter Walk Test 
(10MWT) and Functional Gait Assessment (FGA). We used a Spearman correlation 
analysis (ρ) to examine the relationship between minimum lateral COM excursion 
and clinical measures.
RESULTS: Minimum lateral COM excursion had significant moderate correlations 
with BBS (ρ = -0.54, p = 0.014), TUG (ρ = 0.59, p = 0.007), FGA (ρ = -0.59, 
p = 0.007), 10MWT-preferred (ρ = -0.59, p = 0.006) and 10MWT-fast (ρ = -0.68, 
p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Control of lateral COM motion during walking is associated with a 
wide range of clinical gait and balance measures in people with iSCI. This 
finding suggests the ability to control lateral COM motion during walking could 
be a contributing factor to gait and balance in people with iSCI.

Practice walking on a treadmill-mounted balance beam modifies beam walking 
sacral movement and alters performance in other balance tasks.

The goals of this study were to determine if a single 30-minute session of 
practice walking on a treadmill mounted balance beam: 1) altered sacral marker 
movement kinematics during beam walking, and 2) affected measures of balance 
during treadmill walking and standing balance. Two groups of young, healthy 
human subjects practiced walking on a treadmill mounted balance beam for thirty 
minutes. One group trained with intermittent visual occlusions and the other 
group trained with unperturbed vision. We hypothesized that the subjects would 
show changes in sacrum movement kinematics after training and that there would 
be group differences due to larger improvements in beam walking performance by 
the visual occlusions group. We also investigated if there was any balance 
transfer from training on the beam to treadmill walking (margin of stability) 
and to standing static balance (center of pressure excursion). We found 
significant differences in sacral marker maximal velocity after training for 
both groups, but no significant differences between the two groups from 
training. There was limited evidence of balance transfer from beam-walking 
practice to gait margin of stability for treadmill walking and for single leg 
standing balance, but not for tandem stance balance. The number of step-offs 
while walking on a narrow beam had the largest change with training (partial η2 
= 0.7), in accord with task specificity. Other balance metrics indicative of 
transfer had lower effect sizes (partial η2<0.5). Given the limited transfer 
across balance training tasks, future work should examine how intermittent 
visual occlusions during multi-task training improve real world functional 
outcomes.

Running has a high incidence of overuse injuries. Achilles tendon (AT) injuries 
may occur due to high forces and repetitive loading during running. Foot strike 
pattern and cadence have been linked to the magnitude of AT loading. The effect 
of running speed on AT stress and strain, muscle forces, gait parameters and 
running kinematics is not well addressed in recreational runners with lower pace 
of running. Twenty-two female participants ran on an instrumented treadmill 
between 2.0 and 5.0 m/s. Kinetic and kinematic data were obtained. AT 
cross-sectional area data were collected using ultrasound imaging. Inverse 
dynamics with static optimization was used to calculate muscle forces and AT 
loading. AT stress, strain and cadence increased with greater running speed. 
Foot inclination angle indicated a rearfoot strike pattern among all 
participants, which increased as running speed increased but the latter 
plateaued after 4.0 m/s. The soleus contributed more force in running compared 
to the gastrocnemius throughout all speeds. Highest running speeds had the most 
stress on the AT, with changes to foot inclination angle and cadence. 
Understanding the relation of AT loading variables with running speed may aid in 
understanding how applied load may influence injury.

BACKGROUND: Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition related to chronic 
venous disease that may progress to venous leg ulceration and impair quality of 
life of those affected. Treatments such as physical exercise may be useful to 
reduce CVI symptoms. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of physical exercise programmes 
for the treatment of individuals with non-ulcerated CVI.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the 
Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL 
databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry 
Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 28 March 2022.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 
exercise programmes with no exercise in people with non-ulcerated CVI.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary 
outcomes were intensity of disease signs and symptoms, ejection fraction, venous 
refilling time, and incidence of venous leg ulcer. Our secondary outcomes were 
quality of life, exercise capacity, muscle strength, incidence of surgical 
intervention, and ankle joint mobility. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of 
the evidence for each outcome.
MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs involving 146 participants. The studies 
compared a physical exercise group with a control group that did not perform a 
structured exercise programme. The exercise protocols differed between studies. 
We assessed three studies to be at an overall unclear risk of bias, one study at 
overall high risk of bias, and one study at overall low risk of bias. We were 
not able to combine data in meta-analysis as studies did not report all 
outcomes, and different methods were used to measure and report outcomes. Two 
studies reported intensity of CVI disease signs and symptoms using a validated 
scale. There was no clear difference in signs and symptoms between groups in 
baseline to six months after treatment (Venous Clinical Severity Score mean 
difference (MD) -0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.02 to 2.26; 28 
participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence), and we are uncertain if 
exercise alters the intensity of signs and symptoms eight weeks after treatment 
(MD -4.07, 95% CI -6.53 to -1.61; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty 
evidence). There was no clear difference in ejection fraction between groups 
from baseline to six months follow-up (MD 4.88, 95% CI -1.82 to 11.58; 28 
participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Three studies reported on 
venous refilling time. We are uncertain if there is an improvement in venous 
refilling time between groups for baseline to six-month changes (MD 10.70 
seconds, 95% CI 8.86 to 12.54; 23 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty 
evidence) or baseline to eight-week change (MD 9.15 seconds, 95% CI 5.53 to 
12.77 for right side; MD 7.25 seconds, 95% CI 5.23 to 9.27 for left side; 21 
participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear 
difference in venous refilling index for baseline to six-month changes (MD 0.57 
mL/min, 95% CI -0.96 to 2.10; 28 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty 
evidence). No included studies reported the incidence of venous leg ulcers. One 
study reported health-related quality of life using validated instruments 
(Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study (VEINES) and 36-item 
Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), physical component score (PCS) and mental 
component score (MCS)). We are uncertain if exercise alters baseline to 
six-month changes in health-related quality of life between groups (VEINES-QOL: 
MD 4.60, 95% CI 0.78 to 8.42; SF-36 PCS: MD 5.40, 95% CI 0.63 to 10.17; SF-36 
MCS: MD 0.40, 95% CI -3.85 to 4.65; 40 participants, 1 study; all very 
low-certainty evidence). Another study used the Chronic Venous Disease Quality 
of Life Questionnaire (CIVIQ-20), and we are uncertain if exercise alters 
baseline to eight-week changes in health-related quality of life between groups 
(MD 39.36, 95% CI 30.18 to 48.54; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty 
evidence). One study reported no differences between groups without presenting 
data. There was no clear difference between groups in exercise capacity measured 
as time on treadmill (baseline to six-month changes) (MD -0.53 minutes, 95% CI 
-5.25 to 4.19; 35 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). We are 
uncertain if exercise improves exercise capacity as assessed by the 6-minute 
walking test (MD 77.74 metres, 95% CI 58.93 to 96.55; 21 participants, 1 study; 
very low-certainty evidence). Muscle strength was measured using dynamometry or 
using heel lifts counts. We are uncertain if exercise increases peak torque/body 
weight (120 revolutions per minute) (changes from baseline to six months MD 3.10 
ft-lb, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.22; 29 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty 
evidence). There was no clear difference between groups in baseline to 
eight-week change in strength measured by a hand dynamometer (MD 12.24 lb, 95% 
CI -7.61 to 32.09 for the right side; MD 11.25, 95% CI -14.10 to 36.60 for the 
left side; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). We are 
uncertain if there is an increase in heel lifts (n) (baseline to six-month 
changes) between groups (MD 7.70, 95% CI 0.94 to 14.46; 39 participants, 1 
study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference between 
groups in ankle mobility measured during dynamometry (baseline to six-month 
change MD -1.40 degrees, 95% CI -4.77 to 1.97; 29 participants, 1 study; very 
low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if exercise increases plantar flexion 
measured by a goniometer (baseline to eight-week change MD 12.13 degrees, 95% CI 
8.28 to 15.98 for right leg; MD 10.95 degrees, 95% CI 7.93 to 13.97 for left 
leg; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). In all cases, we 
downgraded the certainty of evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to assess the 
benefits and harms of physical exercise in people with chronic venous disease. 
Future research into the effect of physical exercise should consider types of 
exercise protocols (intensity, frequency, and time), sample size, blinding, and 
homogeneity according to the severity of disease.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the immediate effects of different types of augmented 
feedback on walking speed and intrinsic motivation post-stroke.
DESIGN: A within-subjects repeated-measures design.
SETTING: A university rehabilitation center.
PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen individuals with chronic stroke hemiparesis with a mean 
age of 55.67±13.63 years and median stroke onset of 36 (24, 81) months (N=18).
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: Fast walking speed measured on a robotic treadmill for 13 
meters without feedback and 13 meters with augmented feedback on each of the 3 
experimental conditions: (1) without virtual reality (VR), (2) with a simple VR 
interface, and (3) with VR-exergame. Intrinsic motivation was measured using the 
Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI).
RESULTS: Although the differences were not statistically significant, 
fast-walking speed was higher in the augmented feedback without VR (0.86±0.44 
m/s); simple VR interface (0.87±0.41 m/s); VR-exergame (0.87±0.44 m/s) 
conditions than in the fast-walking speed without feedback (0.81±0.40 m/s) 
condition. The type of feedback had a significant effect on intrinsic motivation 
(P=.04). The post hoc analysis revealed borderline significance on IMI-interest 
and enjoyment between the VR-exergame condition and the without-VR condition 
(P=.091).
CONCLUSION: Augmenting feedback affected the intrinsic motivation and enjoyment 
of adults with stroke asked to walk fast on a robotic treadmill. Additional 
studies with larger samples are warranted to examine the relations among these 
aspects of motivation and ambulation training outcomes.

PURPOSE: Tibial bone stress injuries are a common overuse injury among runners 
and military cadets. Current treatment involves wearing an orthopedic walking 
boot for 3 to 12 wk, which limits ankle motion and leads to lower limb muscle 
atrophy. A dynamic ankle orthosis (DAO) was designed to provide a distractive 
force that offloads in-shoe vertical force and retains sagittal ankle motion 
during walking. It remains unclear how tibial compressive force is altered by 
the DAO. This study compared tibial compressive force and ankle motion during 
walking between the DAO and an orthopedic walking boot.
METHODS: Twenty young adults walked on an instrumented treadmill at 1.0 m·s -1 
in two brace conditions: DAO and walking boot. Three-dimensional kinematic, 
ground reaction forces, and in-shoe vertical force data were collected to 
calculate peak tibial compressive force. Paired t -tests and Cohen's d effect 
sizes were used to assess mean differences between conditions.
RESULTS: Peak tibial compressive force ( P = 0.023; d = 0.5) and Achilles tendon 
force ( P = 0.017; d = 0.5) were moderately lower in the DAO compared with the 
walking boot. Sagittal ankle excursion was 54.9% greater in the DAO compared 
with the walking boot ( P = 0.05; d = 3.1).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study indicated that the DAO moderately 
reduced tibial compressive force and Achilles tendon force and allowed more 
sagittal ankle excursion during treadmill walking compared with an orthopedic 
walking boot.

The basal ganglia are important modulators of the cognitive and motor benefits 
of exercise. However, the neural networks underlying these benefits remain 
poorly understood. Our study systematically analyzed exercise-associated changes 
in metabolic connectivity in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic network during 
the performance of a new motor task, with regions-of-interest defined based on 
mesoscopic domains recently defined in the mouse brain structural connectome. 
Mice were trained on a motorized treadmill for six weeks or remained sedentary 
(control), thereafter undergoing [14C]-2-deoxyglucose metabolic brain mapping 
during wheel walking. Regional cerebral glucose uptake (rCGU) was analyzed in 
3-dimensional brains reconstructed from autoradiographic brain sections using 
statistical parametric mapping. Metabolic connectivity was assessed by 
calculating inter-regional correlation of rCGU cross-sectionally across subjects 
within a group. Compared to controls, exercised animals showed broad decreases 
in rCGU in motor areas, but increases in limbic areas, as well as the visual and 
association cortices. In addition, exercised animals showed (i) increased 
positive metabolic connectivity within and between the motor cortex and 
caudoputamen (CP), (ii) newly emerged negative connectivity of the substantia 
nigra pars reticulata with the globus pallidus externus, and CP, and (iii) 
reduced connectivity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Increased metabolic 
connectivity in the motor circuit in the absence of increases in rCGU strongly 
suggests greater network efficiency, which is also supported by the reduced 
involvement of PFC-mediated cognitive control during the performance of a new 
motor task. Our study delineates exercise-associated changes in functional 
circuitry at the subregional level and provides a framework for understanding 
the effects of exercise on functions of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic 
network.

Patients with intermittent claudication have significantly higher levels of 
inflammatory biomarkers, particularly interleukins, which is also a consequence 
of exercise limitation. Physical activity, which is one of the preventive 
measures against atherosclerosis, is associated with a decrease in inflammatory 
biomarkers. Therefore, in our study, we investigated the effects of 
revascularization of peripheral arteries in patients with intermittent 
claudication on functional capacity and levels of inflammatory markers. The 
study included 26 patients with intermittent claudication who underwent 
percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Before the procedure and 2-4 months 
after successful revascularization, the ankle-brachial index (ABI), functional 
capacity using the treadmill test, and the walking impairment questionnaire 
(WIQ) were determined. Inflammatory biomarkers were also measured before and 
after procedures. Successful revascularization was associated with an increase 
in intermittent claudication: 120 (20-315) versus 300 (100-1000 m), P < 0.001. 
Treadmill testing showed a significant increase in initial and maximal walking 
distance. After revascularization, ABI increased significantly (0.55 vs 0.82, 
P < 0.003). Improvement in functional performance was also demonstrated by WIQ. 
Two to three months after revascularization, some inflammatory biomarkers 
decreased significantly: fibrinogen, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 
(IL-8). The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNFα) also did not decrease significantly. The levels of some 
inflammatory markers: IL-6, TNFα, and fibrinogen were significantly related to 
the improvement in patients' functional capacity. The results of our study show 
that successful revascularization of the lower limb arteries not only improves 
the functional capacity of patients with intermittent claudication, but also 
reduces the systemic inflammatory response and may have a preventive effect on 
local and concomitant other atherosclerotic diseases.

Understanding internal and external loading in exercise is important for safe 
rehabilitation. The physiological parameters of dogs have been studied in 
swimming, but those of dogs walking on an underwater treadmill have not been 
documented. In this study, four healthy beagle dogs were examined for changes in 
physiological parameters before and after walking in water for 20 min at a speed 
of 4 km/h with the water level set at the height of the hip joint as an external 
load. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using paired sample 
t-tests. Results indicated that heart rate (125 ± 11.8 beat/min to 163 ± 9.5 
beat/min) and lactate levels (2 ± 0.1 mmol/L to 2.4 ± 0.2 mmol/ L) significantly 
increased from before to after walking on an underwater treadmill. Additional 
research is needed on internal loading when using underwater treadmills, which 
would further contribute to the safety of rehabilitation.

Accelerometer data can be used to estimate incident oxygen consumption (VO2) 
during physical activity. Relationships between the accelerometer metrics and 
VO2 are typically determined using specific walking or running protocols on a 
track or treadmill. In this study, we compared the predictive performance of 
three different metrics based on the mean amplitude deviation (MAD) of the raw 
three-dimensional acceleration signal during maximal tests performed on a track 
or treadmill. A total of 53 healthy adult volunteers participated in the study, 
29 performed the track test and 24 the treadmill test. During the tests, the 
data were collected using hip-worn triaxial accelerometers and metabolic gas 
analyzers. Data from both tests were pooled for primary statistical analysis. 
For typical walking speeds at VO2 less than 25 mL/kg/min, accelerometer metrics 
accounted for 71-86% of the variation in VO2. For typical running speeds 
starting from VO2 of 25 mL/kg/min up to over 60 mL/kg/min, 32-69% of the 
variation in VO2 could be explained, while the test type had an independent 
effect on the results, except for the conventional MAD metrics. The MAD metric 
is the best predictor of VO2 during walking, but the poorest during running. 
Depending on the intensity of locomotion, the choice of proper accelerometer 
metrics and test type may affect the validity of the prediction of incident VO2.

This study aims compare the spatiotemporal and kinematic running parameters 
obtained by the WalkerView (Tecnobody, Bergamo, Italy) with those recorded by a 
optoelectronic 3D motion capture system. Seventeen participants were 
simultaneously recorded by the WalkerView and a motion capture system during 
running tests on the WalkerView at two different speeds (i.e., 8 km/h and 
10 km/h). Per each parameter and speed the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the 
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and the mean of the difference (MOD) 
and limits of agreement (LOAs) indexes obtained from Bland-Altman analysis were 
used to compare the two systems. ICCs show an excellent agreement for the mean 
step time and the cadence at both testing speeds (ICC=0.993 at 8 km/h; 
ICC=0.998 at 10 km/h); a lower agreement was found for all the kinematic 
variables. Small differences for some spatio-temporal parameters and greater 
differences for the kinematic variables were found. Therefore, WalkerView could 
represent a practical, accessible, and less expensive tool for clinicians, 
researchers, and sports trainers to assess the characteristics spatio-temporal 
parameters of running in non-laboratory settings.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of exoskeleton-assisted gait training in 
stroke patients.
DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Rehabilitation department in a single tertiary hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty (N=30) chronic stroke patients with Functional Ambulatory 
Category scale (FAC) between 2 and 4.
INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: training with 
Healbot G, a wearable powered exoskeleton (Healbot G group; n=15), or treadmill 
training (control group; n=15). All participants received 30 minutes of 
training, 10 times per week, for 4 weeks.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was oxyhemoglobin level changes, 
representing cortical activity in both motor cortices using functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy. The secondary outcomes included FAC, Berg Balance 
Scale, Motricity Index for the lower extremities (MI-Lower), 10-meter walk test, 
and gait symmetry ratio (spatial step and temporal symmetry ratio).
RESULTS: Compared to the control group, during the entire training session, the 
pre-training and post-training mean cortical activity, and the amount of 
increment between pre- and post-training were significantly higher in the 
Healbot G group (∆mean ± SD; pre-training, 0.245±0.119, post-training, 
0.697±0.429, between pre- and post-training, 0.471±0.401μmol, P<.001). There was 
no significant difference in cortical activity between affected- and unaffected 
hemispheres after Healbot G training. FAC (∆mean ± SD; 0.35 ± 0.50, P=.012), 
MI-Lower (∆mean ± SD; 7.01 ± 0.14, P=.001), and spatial step gait symmetry ratio 
(∆mean ± SD; -0.32 ± 0.25, P=.049) were improved significantly in the Healbot G 
group.
CONCLUSION: Exoskeleton-assisted gait training induces cortical modulation 
effect in both motor cortices, a balanced cortical activation pattern with 
improvements in spatial step symmetry ratio, walking ability, and voluntary 
strength.

One of the problems facing an ageing population is functional decline associated 
with reduced levels of physical activity (PA). Traditionally researcher or 
clinician input is necessary to capture parameters of gait or PA. Enabling older 
adults to monitor their activity independently could raise their awareness of 
their activitiy levels, promote self-care and potentially mitigate the risks 
associated with ageing. The ankle is accepted as the optimum position for sensor 
placement to capture parameters of gait however, the waist is proposed as a more 
accessible body-location for older adults. This study aimed to compare 
step-count measurements obtained from a single inertial sensor positioned at the 
ankle and at the waist to that of a criterion measure of step-count, and to 
compare gait parameters obtained from the sensors positioned at the two 
different body-locations. Step-count from the waist-mounted inertial sensor was 
compared with that from the ankle-mounted sensor, and with a criterion measure 
of direct observation in healthy young and healthy older adults during a 
three-minute treadmill walk test. Parameters of gait obtained from the sensors 
at both body-locations were also compared. Results indicated there was a strong 
positive correlation between step-count measured by both the ankle and waist 
sensors and the criterion measure, and between ankle and waist sensor 
step-count, mean step time and mean stride time (r = .802-1.0). There was a 
moderate correlation between the step time variability measures at the waist and 
ankle (r = .405). This study demonstrates that a single sensor positioned at the 
waist is an appropriate method for the capture of important measures of gait and 
physical activity among older adults.

BACKGROUND: Inclined walking is a challenging task that requires active 
neuromuscular control to maintain stability. However, the adaptive strategies 
that preserve stability during inclined walking are not well understood. 
Investigating the effects of self-paced inclined treadmill walking on gait 
stability characteristics and the activation patterns of key lower limb muscles 
can provide insights into these strategies.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of self-paced 
inclined treadmill walking on gait stability characteristics and the activation 
of key lower limb muscles.
METHODS: Twenty-eight able-bodied individuals (mean age 25.02, SD 2.06 years) 
walked on an augmented instrumented treadmill for 3 minutes at 3 inclination 
angles (-8°, 0°, and 8°) at their preferred walking speed. Changes in gait 
characteristics (ie, stability, walking speed, spatial-temporal, kinematic, and 
muscle forces) across inclination angles were assessed using a repeated measures 
ANOVA and the Friedman test.
RESULTS: The study revealed that inclined treadmill walking has a significant 
impact on gait characteristics (P<.001). Changes were observed in 
spatial-temporal parameters, joint angles, and muscle activations depending on 
the treadmill inclination. Specifically, stability and walking speed decreased 
significantly during uphill walking, indicating that it was the most challenging 
walking condition. Uphill walking also led to a decrease in spatial parameters 
by at least 13.53% and a 5.26% to 10.96% increase in temporal parameters. 
Furthermore, joint kinematics and peak activation of several muscles, including 
the hamstrings (biceps femoris, long head=109.5%, biceps femoris, short 
head=53.3%, semimembranosus=98.9%, semitendinosus=90.9%), gastrocnemius (medial 
gastrocnemius=40.6%, lateral gastrocnemius=35.3%), and vastii muscles (vastus 
intermedius=12.8%, vastus lateralis=16.7%) increased significantly during uphill 
walking. In contrast, downhill walking resulted in bilateral reductions in 
spatial-temporal gait parameters, with knee flexion increasing and hip flexion 
and ankle dorsiflexion decreasing. The peak activation of antagonist muscles, 
such as the quadriceps, tibialis anterior, and tibialis posterior, significantly 
increased during downhill walking (rectus femoris=97.7%, vastus lateralis 
=70.6%, vastus intermedius=68.7%, tibialis anterior=72%, tibialis 
posterior=107.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that able-bodied individuals adopt 
specific walking patterns during inclined treadmill walking to maintain a 
comfortable and safe walking performance. The results suggest that inclined 
treadmill walking has the potential to serve as a functional assessment and 
rehabilitation tool for gait stability by targeting muscle training. Future 
research should investigate the effects of inclined treadmill walking on 
individuals with gait impairments and the potential benefits of targeted muscle 
training. A better understanding of the adaptive strategies used during inclined 
walking may lead to the development of more effective rehabilitation 
interventions for individuals with lower limb injuries.

Ataxia is a clinical sign seen in several neurological diseases and has been 
reported as an adverse effect of anti-seizure medication such as phenobarbital 
(PB). Efforts to objectify canine ataxia in order to provide appropriate 
treatment or monitor adverse effects of drugs remain limited. Automated 
quantitative gait analysis can be useful for the acquisition of objective data 
for the evaluation and monitoring of ataxia in dogs. The aim of this prospective 
clinical study was to examine the gait characteristics of dogs with PB induced 
ataxia and compare them with healthy dogs using a computer- and treadmill-based 
gait analysis system. Six healthy dogs and five dogs with idiopathic epilepsy 
(IE) with PB-induced ataxia underwent video- and computer-assisted gait analysis 
during slow walking (maximum speed of 0.7 m/s) on a treadmill with four ground 
reaction force plates (one plate per limb). Kinetic and spatio-temporal gait 
parameters of dogs' locomotion were analyzed, including individually calculated 
coefficients of variation. Dogs with IE treated with PB showed higher 
variability in spatio-temporal but not in kinetic gait parameters. Double 
support phase of gait cycles was increased on the cost of single support and 
swing phases. Body weight standardized ground reaction forces in vertical, 
craniocaudal, and mediolateral direction were severely affected by ataxia. 
Compensatory mechanisms in locomotion of dogs with PB-induced ataxia included 
spatio-temporal and kinetic gait characteristics, most likely in order to 
compensate imbalance caused by limb incoordination.

due to acute flaccid myelitis.

BACKGROUND: Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) occurs rarely in children and 
adolescents when damage to spinal motor neurons rapidly causes flaccid paralysis 
of limb, trunk, and neck muscles and potentially respiratory failure. When neck 
muscles are weakened or paralyzed, a child loses head control, severely 
compromising engagement with their environment. Compensation for lack of head 
control is achieved with external support devices attached to a wheelchair, but 
there is no indication in the AFM literature of therapeutic efforts to restore 
head control. In this case series, we explore the possibility of the recovery of 
head control when children with AFM received activity-based restorative 
therapies (ABRTs) guided by principles targeting motor control.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Three children, two male and one female, aged 6, 9, and 7, 
with a history of AFM-onset at 5, 7, and 4 years respectively, enrolled in an 
activity-based restorative therapies outpatient program targeting activation of 
the neuromuscular system below the lesion. Each of them lacked head control, was 
either ventilator-dependent or had a tracheostomy, and was a power wheelchair 
user via hand/foot control.
METHODS: Activity-based restorative therapies were provided 5 days/week: 1.5 h 
of activity-based locomotor training and 1.5 h of activity-based neuromuscular 
electrical stimulation.
RESULTS: An approach to addressing head/neck control developed iteratively 
across disciplines, from complete compensation with passive external head 
support to emerging head control during diverse tasks, e.g., sitting, reaching, 
driving a power chair, sit-to-stand, standing, stepping on a treadmill, and 
walking. Key principles identified and employed were (a) passive facilitation, 
(b) external head support, (c) posterior head support, (d) graded manual 
facilitation, and (e) independent head control.
DISCUSSION: The recovery of head control in children with paralysis due to AFM 
may be accelerated when executing a step-wise progression to effectively target 
and challenge head control in parallel with activity-based restorative 
therapies. In treating three children with a chronic lack of head control, a 
therapeutic strategy was iteratively developed guided by scientific principles, 
e.g., segmental assessment of control, to promote recovery of head control. 
While this strategy is encouraging, gaps in sensitive and responsive measurement 
instruments and treatment technologies persist in guiding assistance, 
challenging, and promoting independent head control.

Exercise and increased physical activity are vital components of the standard 
treatment guidelines for many chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and 
cardiovascular disease. Although strenuous exercise cannot be recommended to 
people with numerous chronic conditions, walking is something most people can 
perform. In comparison to high-intensity training, the metabolic consequences of 
low-intensity walking have been less well studied. We present here a feasibility 
study of a subject who performed an exercise intervention of low-intensity, 
non-fatiguing walking on a deskmill/treadmill for 200 min daily, approximately 
the average time a German spends watching television per day. This low-impact 
physical activity has the advantages that it can be done while performing other 
tasks such as reading or watching TV, and it can be recommended to obese 
patients or patients with heart disease. We find that this intervention led to 
substantial weight loss, comparable to that of bariatric surgery. To study the 
metabolic changes caused by this intervention, we performed an in-depth 
metabolomic profiling of the blood both directly after walking to assess the 
acute changes, as well as 1.5 days after physical activity to identify the 
long-term effects that persist. We find changes in acylcarnitine levels 
suggesting that walking activates fatty acid beta oxidation, and that this 
mitochondrial reprogramming is still visible 1.5 days post-walking. We also find 
that walking mildly increases gut permeability, leading to increased exposure of 
the blood to metabolites from the gut microbiome. Overall, these data provide a 
starting point for designing future intervention studies with larger cohorts.

The human musculoskeletal system is well adapted to use energy-efficient 
muscle-tendon mechanics during walking and running, but muscle behaviour during 
on-snow locomotion is unknown. Here, we examined muscle and muscle-tendon unit 
behaviour during diagonal-style cross-country roller skiing at three speed and 
incline conditions to examine whether skiers can exploit energy-saving 
mechanisms of the muscle-tendon unit. We assessed lower leg muscle and 
muscle-tendon unit mechanics and muscle activity in 13 high-level skiers during 
treadmill roller skiing using synchronised ultrasound, motion capture, 
electromyography and ski-binding force measurements. Participants skied using 
diagonal style at 2.5 and 3.5 m s-1 up 5 deg, and at 2.5 m s-1 up 10 deg. We 
found an uncoupling of muscle and joint behaviour during most parts of the 
propulsive kick phase in all conditions (P<0.01). Gastrocnemius muscle fascicles 
actively shortened ∼0.9 cm during the kick phase, while the muscle-tendon unit 
went through a stretch-shortening cycle. Peak muscle-tendon unit shortening 
velocity was 5 times faster than fascicle velocity (37.5 versus 7.4 cm s-1, 
P<0.01). Steeper incline skiing was achieved by greater muscle activity (24%, 
P=0.04) and slower fascicle shortening velocity (3.4 versus 4.5 cm s-1, P<0.01). 
Faster speed was achieved by greater peak muscle activity (23%, P<0.01) and no 
change in fascicle shortening velocity. Our data show that, during 
diagonal-style cross-county skiing, muscle behaviour is uncoupled from the joint 
movement, which enables beneficial contractile conditions and energy utilisation 
with different slopes and speeds. Active preloading at the end of the glide 
phase may facilitate these mechanisms.

Spatiotemporal metrics such as step frequency have been associated with running 
injuries in some studies. Wearables can measure these metrics and provide 
real-time feedback in-field, but are often not validated. This study assessed 
the validity of commercially available wireless instrumented insoles (ARION) for 
quantifying spatiotemporal metrics during level running at different speeds 
(2.78-5.0 m s-1 ,) and slopes (3° and 6° up/downhill) to an instrumented 
treadmill. Mean raw, percentage and absolute percentage error, and limits of 
agreement (LoA) were calculated. Agreement was statistically quantified using 
four thresholds: excellent, <5%; good, <10%; acceptable, <15%; and poor, >15% 
error. Excellent agreement (<5% error) was achieved for stride time across all 
conditions, and for step frequency across all but one condition with good 
agreement. Contact time and swing time generally showed at least good agreement. 
The mean difference across all conditions was -0.95% for contact time, 0.11% for 
stride time, 0.6% for swing time, -0.11% for step frequency, and -0.09% when 
averaged across all outcomes and conditions. The accuracy at an individual level 
was generally good to excellent, being <10% for all but two conditions, with 
these conditions being <15%. Additional experiments among four runners showed 
that step length could also be measured with an accuracy of 1.76% across 
different speeds with an updated version of the insoles. These findings suggests 
that the ARION wearable may not only be useful for large-scale in-field studies 
investigating group differences, but also to quantify spatiotemporal metrics 
with generally good to excellent accuracy for individual runners.

INTRODUCTION: Robot-assisted gait therapy is frequently used for gait therapy in 
children and adolescents but has been shown to limit the physiological 
excursions of the trunk and pelvis. Actuated pelvis movements might support more 
physiological trunk patterns during robot-assisted training. However, not every 
patient is expected to react identically to actuated pelvis movements. 
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify different trunk movement 
patterns with and without actuated pelvis movements and compare them based on 
their similarity to the physiological gait pattern.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A clustering algorithm was used to separate pediatric 
patients into three groups based on different kinematic reactions of the trunk 
to walking with and without actuated pelvis movements. The three clusters 
included 9, 11 and 15 patients and showed weak to strong correlations with 
physiological treadmill gait. The groups also statistically differed in clinical 
assessment scores, which were consistent with the strength of the correlations. 
Patients with a higher gait capacity reacted with more physiological trunk 
movements to actuated pelvis movements.
CONCLUSION: Actuated pelvis movements do not lead to physiological trunk 
movements in patients with a poor trunk control, while patients with better 
walking functions can show physiological trunk movements. Therapists should 
carefully consider for whom and why they decide to include actuated pelvis 
movements in their therapy plan.

Gait disturbances are among the main symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and 
can increase fall risk. In this study we aimed to systematically evaluate the 
effects of different exercise modes on gait indexes of PD patients. We conducted 
a review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in studies 
listed in Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, 
ClinicalTrailS.gov, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases from 
their inception to October 23, 2021. Eligible studies were randomized controlled 
trials investigating the effect of exercise on gait index by using the Timed Up 
and Go test, (TUG), stride length, stride cadence, or 6 Minutes Walking Test 
(6MWT). We used Review Manager 5.3 to evaluate the quality of the included 
literature, and we used Stata 15.1 and R-Studio for the network meta-analysis. 
We assessed the relative ranking of therapies by the surface under the 
cumulative ranking possibilities. In 159 studies, there were 24 exercise 
interventions. Compared with the control group, 13 exercises showed significant 
improvements on the TUG; six exercises were significantly better for improving 
stride length; only one exercise was better for improving stride cadence; and 
four exercises were better for improving the 6MWT. The surface under the 
cumulative ranking curves suggested that Pilates, body weight support treadmill 
training, resistance training, and a multidisciplinary exercise program were 
preferable for gains on TUG, stride length, stride cadence, and 6MWT. This 
meta-analytic review found that exercise therapies bring obvious benefits to 
gait indexes of patients with PD, and the efficacy of exercise therapies varied 
with different types of exercise and outcome indexes.

Changing movement patterns in response to environmental perturbations is a 
critical aspect of gait and is related to reducing the energetic cost of the 
movement. Exercise improves energetic capacity for submaximal exercise and may 
affect how people adapt movement to reach an energetic minimum. The purpose of 
this study was to determine whether self-reported exercise behavior influences 
gait adaptation in young adults. Young adults who met the optimal volume of 
exercise according to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (MOVE; n = 
19) and young adults who did not meet the optimal volume of exercise (notMOVE; n 
= 13) walked on a split-belt treadmill with one belt moving twice the speed of 
the other belt for 10 minutes. Step length asymmetry (SLA) and mechanical work 
done by each leg were measured. Nonlinear mixed effects models compared the time 
course of adaptation between MOVE and notMOVE, and t-tests compared net work at 
the end of adaptation between MOVE and notMOVE. Compared to notMOVE, MOVE had a 
faster initial response to the split belt treadmill, and continued to adapt over 
the duration of split-belt treadmill walking. Young adults who engage in 
sufficient amounts of exercise responded more quickly to the onset of a 
perturbation, and throughout the perturbation they continued to explore movement 
strategies, which might be related to reduction of energetic cost. Our findings 
provide insights into the multisystem positive effects of exercise, including 
walking adaptation.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have investigated the effect of either different 
load or different surface conditions, such as overground or treadmill walking, 
on human biomechanics. However, studies combining these two aspects are scarce.
RESEARCH QUESTION: The purpose of this study was to quantify the difference in 
spatiotemporal parameters, lower extremity joint kinematics, vertical ground 
reaction forces (vGRF) and muscle activity between normal bodyweight (100 %BW) 
and 20 % increased bodyweight (120 %BW) during overground and treadmill walking.
METHODS: Ten healthy young adults walked overground at self-selected speed and 
on an instrumented treadmill set to the overground speed. Spatiotemporal 
parameters, 3-dimensional lower extremity kinematics, vGRF and muscle activity 
were measured and compared between conditions.
RESULTS: The stance phase was longer for 120 %BW than 100 %BW in both overground 
and treadmill walking. Further, the stance phase was longer and cadence higher 
in treadmill than overground walking for both load conditions. Knee flexion 
angles were more than 3° greater in the second half of swing in treadmill than 
in overground walking. The vGRF was higher for 120 %BW compared to 100 %BW on 
both surfaces (treadmill, first peak: +18.6 %BW; second peak: +13.5 %BW; 
overground, first peak: +22.2 %BW; second peak: +19.8 %BW). Differences between 
conditions greater than 20 % were observed in short periods during the gait 
cycle for vastus medialis, vastus lateralis and semitendinosus.
SIGNIFICANCE: Results regarding the effects of carrying additional load using a 
weight vest on joint kinematics during treadmill walking may be translated to 
overground walking but some changes in muscle activation can be expected.

PURPOSE: To conduct an umbrella review of systematic reviews on functional 
electrical stimulation (FES) to improve walking in adults with an upper motor 
neuron lesion.
METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched, focusing on the effect of FES 
on walking. The methodological quality of reviews was evaluated using AMSTAR2 
and certainty of evidence was established through the GRADE approach.
RESULTS: The methodological quality of the 24 eligible reviews (stroke, n = 16; 
spinal cord injury (SCI), n = 5; multiple sclerosis (MS); n = 2; mixed 
population, n = 1) ranged from critically low to high. Stroke reviews concluded 
that FES improved walking speed through an orthotic (immediate) effect and had a 
therapeutic benefit (i.e., over time) compared to usual care (low certainty 
evidence). There was low-to-moderate certainty evidence that FES was no better 
or worse than an Ankle Foot Orthosis regarding walking speed post 6 months. MS 
reviews concluded that FES had an orthotic but no therapeutic effect on walking. 
SCI reviews concluded that FES with or without treadmill training improved speed 
but combined with an orthosis was no better than orthosis alone. FES may improve 
quality of life and reduce falls in MS and stroke populations.
CONCLUSION: FES has orthotic and therapeutic benefits. Certainty of evidence was 
low-to-moderate, mostly due to high risk of bias, low sample sizes, and wide 
variation in outcome measures. Future trials must be of higher quality, use 
agreed outcome measures, including measures other than walking speed, and 
examine the effects of FES for adults with cerebral palsy, traumatic and 
acquired brain injury, and Parkinson's disease.

BACKGROUND: Erectile dysfunction (ED) and metabolic syndrome (MeTS) are highly 
prevalent in chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this lifestyle modification study is to explore the 
response of MeTS components and ED to a 12-week lifestyle modification program 
(low-calorie diet and moderate-intensity treadmill walking) in 60 obese men with 
CPP, mild and moderate ED, and MeTS.
THE DESIGN, SETTINGS, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTION: In this lifestyle 
modification randomized study, a university-based hospital recruitment of 60 
obese men with CPP, mild and moderate ED, and MeTS was randomly performed. Men 
were randomly assigned to the lifestyle modification group (n = 30, received 
low-calorie diet and moderate-intensity treadmill walking programs) or waitlist 
group (n = 30). The following outcomes were assessed as follows: body mass 
index, psoriasis severity (assessed via psoriasis area and severity index), ED 
(assessed by the five-item internal index of erectile function), and components 
of MeTS (waist circumference, blood pressure, serum high-density lipoprotein, 
serum triglycerides, and serum fasting blood glucose).
RESULTS: Trends of significant improvements in all outcomes were documented in 
favor of the lifestyle modification group. All outcomes of the waitlist group 
did not show the same reported significant improvements of the lifestyle 
modification group.
CONCLUSION: A 12-week lifestyle modification program as a tool for weight loss 
in obese men with CPP is a good therapeutic method to improve psoriasis severity 
and psoriasis-associated ED and MeTS.

Identifying potential contributing factors for physical inactivity in people 
with knee osteoarthritis is vital for designing practical activity promoting 
interventions. Walking is a common activity, but it is unknown how gait 
characteristics may influence physical activity and if psychological factors, 
specifically fear of movement (kinesiophobia), contribute to this relationship. 
The aim of our study was to investigate the contributions of select gait 
parameters and kinesiophobia to activity levels. Cross-sectional data from 40 
participants (F 24|M 16; age 57.6 ± 8.9 years; BMI 34.7 ± 7.0 kg/m2 ) with uni- 
or bilateral knee osteoarthritis were included. Physical activity and 
kinesiophobia were assessed by self-report using the University of California, 
Los Angeles activity rating scale, and Tampa scale for kinesiophobia, 
respectively. Gait parameters were collected with three-dimensional gait 
analysis while participants walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill at a 
self-selected speed. Higher peak sagittal plane joint moments at the ankle 
(ρ = 0.418, p = 0.007), and hip (ρ = 0.348, p = 0.028), faster self-selected 
gait speed (ρ = 0.553, p < 0.001), and less kinesiophobia or fear of movement 
(ρ = -0.695, p < 0.001) were independently related to higher physical activity 
level in adults with knee osteoarthritis. In hierarchical regression models, 
after accounting for covariates, only self-selected gait speed, and 
kinesiophobia significantly contributed to explaining the variation in physical 
activity level. Statement of clinical significance: Interventions aimed at 
improving physical activity participation in those with lower limb 
osteoarthritis should consider assessing the contribution of pain-related fear 
of movement.

METHODS: This study examined the effects of exercise training for 8 weeks on 
blood immune cell characteristics among 20 breast cancer survivors (age 56 ± 6 
years, Body Mass Index 25.4 ± 3.0 kg m2) within two years of treatment. 
Participants were randomly allocated to a partly-supervised or a 
remotely-supported exercise group (n = 10 each). The partly supervised group 
undertook 2 supervised (laboratory-based treadmill walking and cycling) and 1 
unsupervised session per week (outdoor walking) progressing from 35 to 50 min 
and 55% to 70% V˙O2max. The remotely-supported group received weekly 
exercise/outdoor walking targets (progressing from 105 to 150 min per week 55% 
to 70% V˙O2max) via weekly telephone calls discussing data from a fitness 
tracker. Immune cell counts were assessed using flow cytometry: CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells (Naïve, NA; Central memory, CM; and Effector cells, EM and EMRA; using 
CD27/CD45RA), Stem cell-like memory T cells (TSCMs; using CD95/CD127), B cells 
(plasmablasts, memory, immature and naïve cells using CD19/CD27/CD38/CD10) and 
Natural Killer cells (effector and regulatory cells, using CD56/CD16). T cell 
function was assessed by unstimulated HLA-DR expression or interferon gamma 
(IFN-γ) production with Enzyme-linked ImmunoSpot assays following stimulation 
with virus or tumour-associated antigens.
RESULTS: Total leukocyte counts, lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils did not 
change with training (p > 0.425). Most CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subtypes, including 
TSCMs, and B cell and NK cell subtypes did not change (p > 0.127). However, 
across groups combined, the CD4+ EMRA T cell count was lower after training 
(cells/µl: 18 ± 33 vs. 12 ± 22, p = 0.028) and these cells were less activated 
on a per cell basis (HLA-DR median fluorescence intensity: 463 ± 138 vs. 
420 ± 77, p = 0.018). Furthermore, the partly-supervised group showed a 
significant decrease in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio (3.90 ± 2.98 vs. 2.54 ± 1.29, 
p = 0.006) and a significant increase of regulatory NK cells (cells/µl: 16 ± 8 
vs. 21 ± 10, p = 0.011). T cell IFN-γ production did not change with exercise 
training (p > 0.515).
DISCUSSION: In summary, most immune cell characteristics are relatively stable 
with 8 weeks of exercise training among breast cancer survivors. The lower 
counts and activation of CD4+ EMRA T cells, might reflect an 
anti-immunosenescence effect of exercise.

Quasi-passive lower limbs exosuit: an in-depth assessment of fatigue, kinematic 
and muscular patterns while comparing assistive strategies on an expert 
subject's gait analysis.

di Tecnologia (IIT), Genova, Italy.

Wearable robots are becoming a valuable solution that helps injured, and elderly 
people regain mobility and improve clinical outcomes by speeding up the 
rehabilitation process. The XoSoft exosuit identified several benefits, 
including improvement of assistance, usability, and acceptance with a soft, 
modular, bio-mimetic, and quasi-passive exoskeleton. This study compares two 
assistive configurations: (i) a bilateral hip flexion (HA, hips-assistance) and 
(ii) a bilateral hip flexion combined with ankle plantarflexion (HAA, 
hips-ankles-assistance) with the main goal of evaluating compensatory actions 
and synergetic effects generated by the human- exoskeleton interaction. A 
complete description of this complex interaction scenario with this actuated 
exosuit is evaluated during a treadmill walking task, using several indices to 
quantify the human-robot interaction in terms of muscular activation and 
fatigue, metabolic expenditure, and kinematic motion patterns. Evidence shows 
that the HAA biomimetic controller is synergetic with the musculature and 
performs better concerning the other control strategy. The experimentation 
demonstrated a metabolic expenditure reduction of 8% of Metabolic Equivalent of 
Task (MET), effective assistance of the muscular activation of 12.5%, a decrease 
of the muscular fatigue of 0.6% of the mean frequency, and a significant 
reduction of the compensatory actions, as discussed in this work. Compensatory 
effects are present in both assistive configurations, but the HAA modality 
provides a 47% reduction of compensatory effects when considering muscle 
activation.

BACKGROUND: Although there is emerging evidence that aerobic training improves 
walking capacity in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), data are limited about 
the potential benefits of Nordic walking (NW) for this population. This study 
evaluates the effectiveness of outdoor NW training on walking capacity and 
related quality of life for people with MS compared with cycloergometer and 
treadmill aerobic training.
METHODS: A single-blinded (evaluator), randomized, 2-arm clinical trial was 
designed.
RESULTS: A total of 57 patients with MS (38 women and 19 men; mean ± SD age, 
51.98 ± 9.93 years; mean ± SD disease duration, 14.75 ± 8.52 years) were 
included. Both therapeutic modalities improved walking distance as measured by 
the 6-Minute Walk Test after the training period. The NW group showed 
significant improvement on the physical and emotional subscales of the Multiple 
Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 compared with the cycloergometer and treadmill 
group, which showed improvement only on the physical subscale.
CONCLUSIONS: Both training modalities proved to be of equal benefit in improving 
the walking capacity of people with MS, but outdoor NW training also seems to 
have a beneficial effect on the emotional component of health-related quality of 
life.

BACKGROUND: Lateral ankle sprains (LAS) frequently lead to residual soft tissue 
impairments, often attributed to biomechanical dysfunction during movement.
OBJECTIVE: To compare running biomechanics between adolescent runners with soft 
tissue pathologies following LAS (injured) and healthy runners (control) and 
between limbs.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Hospital-affiliated sports injury prevention center.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five adolescent runners with a history of LAS and current 
ankle impingement or tendinopathy (23 female, 2 male; age: 15 ± 2 years; body 
mass index [BMI]: 19.5 ± 2.5 kg/m2 ; symptom duration: 1.1 ± 0.9 years), and 23 
healthy controls without any LAS history (19 female, 4 male; age: 15 ± 1 years; 
BMI: 19.2 ± 2.7 kg/m2 ) were included in this study.
INTERVENTIONS: All participants completed a clinical gait assessment in which 
they ran at a self-selected speed on a force-plate instrumented treadmill, while 
two video cameras recorded two-dimensional sagittal and coronal views.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Foot rotation, step width, contact time, and cadence were 
compared between groups and limbs (involved, uninvolved [or ""better"" for 
bilateral cases]) using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Rearfoot 
landing and foot strike type were compared between groups and limbs using a 
chi-square analysis.
RESULTS: The injured group had significantly increased step width (F = 4.71, 
p = .04; mean difference [MD] with SE: 1.5 [0.7] cm) compared to controls. The 
injured groups' involved limb had longer contact time (F = 4.62, p = .03; 
MDgroup : 12 [7] ms, MDlimb : 22 [11] ms) with more internal foot rotation 
(F = 14.60, p < .001; MDgroup : 2.2 [1.2] degrees, MDlimb : 4.2 [1.3] degrees) 
compared to controls and their contralateral limb. There were no significant 
differences for cadence (F = 2.43, p = .13; MD: 4 [3] steps/min), foot landing 
(X2  = 1.28, p = .53), or foot strike (X2  = 1.24, p = .54).
CONCLUSIONS: Spatiotemporal and kinematic running adaptations may predispose 
young runners with initial LAS to secondary soft tissue dysfunction due to loss 
of stability from ligamentous structures and an overreliance on myotendinous 
control. Clinicians may consider targeting these maladaptations during 
gait-training interventions.

BACKGROUND: Although millions of people with osteoarthritis (OA) have altered 
biomechanical alignment, movement, and knee joint pain during gait, there are no 
effective and sustainable interventions. To mitigate such impairments, we 
developed an untacted self-automated robotic and electromyography 
(EMG)-augmented upper-trunk-lower reciprocal locomotor training (SRGT) 
intervention.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of SRGT and conventional treadmill gait 
training (CTGT) on the medial knee joint space width (JSW), hip adduction moment 
(HAM), knee varus deformity, pain, and physical function in community-dwelling 
older adults with OA.
METHODS: Older adults diagnosed with medial compartment knee OA (5 men, 35 
women; mean age = 78.50 ± 9.10 years) were recruited and underwent either SRGT 
or CTGT, 30 min a day, 3 times a week, over a 4-week period. Outcome 
measurements included the JSW, HAM, knee varus angle (VA), and Western Ontario 
McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC).
RESULTS: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that SRGT ed to greater changes 
in medial knee JSW (p= 0.00001), HAM (p= 0.00001), VA (p= 0.00001), and WOMAC 
(p= 0.00001) scores.
CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence for the long-term clinical 
and biomechanical effects of SRGT on JSW, knee joint kinematics, kinetics, and 
WOMAC scores in older adults with OA. Most importantly, self-automatic robotic 
gait training may be an alternative, effective, and sustainable treatment for 
the upper-trunk-lower reciprocal locomotor training in older adults with OA.

Vision, as queen of the senses, plays a critical role in guiding locomotion. 
Little is known about the effects of vision on gait coordination in terms of 
variability. The uncontrolled manifold (UCM) approach offers a window to the 
structure of motor variability that has been difficult to obtain from the 
traditional correlation analysis. In this study, we used the UCM analysis to 
quantify how the lower limb motion is coordinated to control the center of mass 
(COM) while walking under different visual conditions. We also probed how 
synergy strength evolved along the stance phase. Ten healthy participants walked 
on the treadmill with and without visual information. Leg joint angle variance 
with respect to the whole-body COM was partitioned into good (i.e., the one that 
kept the COM) and bad (i.e., the one that changed the COM) variances. We 
observed that after vision was eliminated, both variances increased throughout 
the stance phase while the strength of the synergy (the normalized difference 
between the two variances) decreased significantly and even reduced to zero at 
heel contact. Thus, walking with restricted vision alters the strength of the 
kinematic synergy to control COM in the plane of progression. We also found that 
the strength of this synergy varied across different walking phases and gait 
events in both visual conditions. We concluded that the UCM analysis can 
quantify altered coordination of COM when vision is blocked and sheds insights 
on the role of vision in the synergistic control of locomotion.

AIM: To obtain insights into the effects of fatigue on the kinematics, kinetics, 
and energy cost of walking (ECoW) in children with cerebral palsy (CP).
METHOD: In this prospective observational study, 12 children with CP (mean age 
12 years 9 months, SD 2 years 7 months; four females, eight males) and 15 
typically developing children (mean age 10 years 8 months, SD 2 years 4 months; 
seven females, eight males) followed a prolonged intensity-based walking 
protocol on an instrumented treadmill, combined with gas analysis measurements. 
The protocol consisted of consecutive stages, including a 6-minute walking 
exercise (6MW) at comfortable speed, 2 minutes of moderate-intensity walking 
(MIW) (with a heart rate > 70% of its predicted maximal), and 4 minutes walking 
after MIW. If necessary, the speed and slope were incremented to reach MIW. 
Outcomes were evaluated at the beginning and end of the 6MW and after MIW.
RESULTS: With prolonged walking, Gait Profile Scores deteriorated slightly for 
both groups (p < 0.01). Knee flexion increased during early stance (p = 0.004) 
and ankle dorsiflexion increased during late stance (p = 0.034) in children with 
CP only. Negligible effects were found for kinetics. No demonstrable change in 
ECoW was found in either group (p = 0.195).
INTERPRETATION: Kinematic deviations in children with CP are progressive with 
prolonged walking. The large variation in adaptations indicates that an 
individual approach is recommended to investigate the effects of physical 
fatigue on gait in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with a higher energy cost of walking which 
affects activities of daily living. Bariatric surgery with sleeve gastrectomy 
(SG) has beneficial effects on weight loss and comorbidities.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of SG on walking 
economy in subjects with severe obesity.
METHODS: This observational cohort study included all patients with morbid 
obesity who were considered suitable candidates for SG between June 2017 and 
June 2019. Each patient underwent an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test 
on a treadmill (modified Bruce protocol) one month before and six months after 
SG. Data on the energy cost of walking were recorded during three protocol 
stages (stage 0-slow flat walking: speed 2.7 km/h, slope 0%; stage ½-slow uphill 
walking: speed 2.7 km/h, slope 5%; stage 1-fast uphill walking: speed 4.0 km/h, 
slope 8%).
RESULTS: 139 patients with morbid obesity (78% women; age 44.1 ± 10.7 years; BMI 
42.5 ± 4.7 kg/m2) were included in the study. At six months post-SG, patients 
presented with a significantly decreased body weight (-30.5 ± 17.2 kg; p < 
0.05), leading to an average BMI of 31.6 ± 4.2 kg/m2. The net energy cost of 
walking (measured in J/m and J/kg/m) of the subjects was lower compared to 
pre-SG at all three protocol stages. This improvement was also confirmed when 
the subjects were grouped by gender and obesity classes.
CONCLUSION: After a significant weight loss induced by SG, regardless of the 
severity of obesity and gender, patients exhibited a lower energy expenditure 
and an improved walking economy. These changes make it easier to perform daily 
routines and may facilitate an increase in physical activity.

Association, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan.

Given that Thoroughbred horses' canter is an asymmetric gait, not only speed but 
also leading or trailing limbs could affect muscle activities. However, the 
muscle activity during a canter remains poorly understood. Hence, we aimed to 
investigate speed and lead-side (leading or trailing) effects on surface 
electromyography (sEMG) during a canter. The sEMG data were recorded from left 
Musculus brachiocephalicus (Br), M. infraspinatus (Inf), long head of M. triceps 
brachii (TB), M. gluteus medius (GM), M. semitendinosus (ST), and M. flexor 
digitorum longus of seven Thoroughbreds with hoof-strain gauges at the left 
hooves. Horses cantered on a flat treadmill at 7, 10, and 13 m/s for 25 s each 
without lead change. Subsequently, the horses trotted for 3 min and cantered at 
the same speed and duration in the opposite lead side (""leading"" at the left 
lead and ""trailing"" at the right lead). The order of the lead side and speed was 
randomized. The mean of 10 consecutive stride durations, duty factors, 
integrated-EMG values (iEMG) for a stride, and muscle onset and offset timing 
were compared using a generalized mixed model (P < 0.05). Stride durations and 
duty factors significantly decreased with speed regardless of the lead side. In 
all muscles, iEMG at 13 m/s significantly increased compared with 7 m/s (ranging 
from +15% to +134%). The lead-side effect was noted in the iEMG of Br (leading > 
trailing, +47%), Inf (leading > trailing, +19%), GM (leading < trailing, +20%), 
and ST (leading < trailing, +19%). In TB, GM, and ST, muscle onset in trailing 
was earlier than the leading, while offset in the leading was earlier in Br. In 
conclusion, different muscles have different responses to speed and lead side; 
thus, both the lead side and running speed should be considered during training 
and/or rehabilitation including canter or gallop.

Treadmill walking is considered a useful therapeutic tool for improving gait in 
Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The study investigated the role of top-down, 
frontal-parietal versus bottom-up parietal-frontal networks, during over-ground 
and treadmill walking in PD and control subjects, using functional connectivity. 
To this end, EEG was recorded simultaneously, during a ten-minute period of 
continuous walking either over-ground or on a treadmill, in thirteen PD patients 
and thirteen age-matched controls. We evaluated EEG directed connectivity, using 
phase transfer entropy in three frequency bands: theta, alpha and beta. PD 
patients showed increased top-down connectivity during over-ground compared with 
treadmill walking, in the beta frequency range. Control subjects showed no 
significant differences in connectivity between the two walking conditions. Our 
results suggest that in PD patients, OG walking was associated with increased 
allocation of attentional resources, compared with that on the TL. These 
functional connectivity modulations may shed further light on the mechanisms 
underlying treadmill versus overground walking in PD.

PURPOSE: Exercise is a critical element for the management of body weight and 
improvement of quality of life of individuals with obesity. Due to its 
convenience and accessibility, running is a commonly used exercise modality to 
meet exercise guidelines. However, the weight-bearing component during high 
impacts of this exercise modality might limit the participation in exercise and 
reduce the effectiveness of running-based exercise interventions in individuals 
with obesity. The hip flexion feedback system (HFFS) assists participants in 
meeting specific exercise intensities by giving the participant specific 
increased hip flexion targets while walking on a treadmill. The resulting 
activity involves walking with increased hip flexion which removes the high 
impacts of running. The purpose of this study was to compare physiological and 
biomechanical parameters during an HFFS session and an independent treadmill 
walking/running session (IND).
METHODS: Heart rate, oxygen consumption (VO2), heart rate error, and tibia peak 
positive accelerations (PPA) were investigated for each condition at 40% and 60% 
of heart rate reserve exercise intensities.
RESULTS: VO2 was higher for IND despite no differences in heart rate. Tibia PPAs 
were reduced during the HFFS session. Heart rate error was reduced for HFFS 
during non-steady state exercise.
CONCLUSION: While demanding lower energy consumption compared to running, HFFS 
exercise results in lower tibia PPAs and more accurate monitoring of exercise 
intensity. HFFS might be a valid exercise alternative for individuals with 
obesity or individuals that require low-impact forces at the lower limbs.

platyrhynchos).

In this study, the effect of the speed on the webbed foot locomotion of the 
mallard was analyzed based on a considerable number of reliable indoor test 
data. Four adult male mallards were selected for analysis, and the locomotion 
speed of the mallard was controlled using the treadmill at an accurate and 
adjustable speed. The locomotion pattern of the webbed foot of the mallard at 
different speeds was recorded using a high-speed camera. The changes in the 
position and conformation of the webbed foot during locomotion on a treadmill 
were tracked and analyzed using Simi-Motion kinematics software. The results 
indicated that the stride length of the mallard increased, and the stance phase 
duration was shortened with the increase of the speed, whereas the swing phase 
duration did not vary significantly. The duty factor decreased with the increase 
of the mallard speed but not drop below to 0.5, because the mallards flew with 
their wings, or moved backward relative to the treadmill with the further 
increase of the speed. Using the energy method to further distinguish gait, and 
through the percentage of congruity analysis, it was found that between 0.73 and 
0.93 m/s, the gait experienced a transition from walking to grounded running, 
with no significant changes in spatiotemporal parameters. At speeds between 0.93 
and 1.6 m/s, mallards adopt a grounded running gait. The instantaneous changes 
of the tarsometatarso-phalangeal joint (TMTPJ) angle and the intertarsal joint 
(ITJ) angle at touch-down, mid-stance and lift-off concomitant with the change 
of the speed were examined with the TMTPJ and ITJ angle as the research objects. 
Moreover, the continuous changes of the joint angles were examined in a complete 
stride cycle. The result indicated that the increase of the speed will also make 
the TMTPJ and ITJ angle change ahead of time in a stride cycle, proving the 
shortened stance phase duration. The ITJ angle changed much more than the TMTPJ. 
Thus, the above result reveals that the mallard primarily responds with the 
increase of the speed by adjusting the ITJ, instead of the TMTPJ. The vertical 
displacement of the toe joint points and the toe joint angle was studied (α 
joint angle is between the second toe and the third toe; β joint angle is 
between the third toe and the fourth toe) with a complete stride cycle as the 
research object. The distal phalanxes of the second, third and fourth toes first 
contacted the ground, and the proximal phalanx touched the ground in turn during 
the early stance phase duration of the mallard, as indicated by the result of 
this study. However, the toes got off the ground in turn from the proximal 
phalanxes when the mallard foot got off the ground. With the decrease of the 
interphalangeal α and β joint angles, the foot web tended to be close and 
rapidly recovered before the next touch-down. The above result reveals that the 
webbed foot of the mallard is a coupling system that plays a role in the 
adjustment of speed.

BACKGROUND: Gait function improves after Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) but is not 
restored to normal levels. Metal-on-metal Resurfacing Arthroplasty (MoM-HRA) is 
an alternative to THA and has shown to restore normal levels gait function and 
physical activity but has been restricted to men owing to problems of metal-ion 
release. Ceramic HRA (cHRA) removes the cobalt-chrome bearing surfaces, thereby 
eliminating these specific metal-ion concerns and aiming to be safe for females.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Is there a difference in gait function of female cHRA 
patients compared to female THA using subjective and objective measures?
METHODS: Fifteen unilateral cHRA and 15 unilateral THA, age and BMI matched, 
completed patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) (Oxford Hip Score, EQ5d and 
MET score) and underwent gait analysis using an instrumented treadmill pre- 
(2-10 weeks) and post-operatively (52-74 weeks). Maximum walking speed (MWS), 
Vertical GRF of the stance phase, GRF symmetry index (SI) and spatiotemporal 
gait measures were recorded. Patients were compared to age, gender and BMI 
healthy controls (CON).
RESULTS: There were no differences in PROMs or gait function between groups 
pre-operatively. Post- operatively, cHRA had a higher MET score (11.2 vs 7.1, 
p = 0.02) and a higher MWS (6.2 vs 6.8 km/hr, p = 0.003) compared to THA. cHRA 
had a similar GRF profile to CON, whereas THA had a reduced push-off force at 
70-77 % of the stance phase compared to CON. At faster walking speeds of 6 km/hr 
walking speed, THA displayed an asymmetric GRF profile (SI<4.4 %) whereas the 
cHRA patients continued to display a symmetrical gait profile. cHRA was able to 
increase step length from pre-op levels (63 vs 66 cm, p = 0.02) and produced a 
larger step length compared to THA (73 vs 79 cm, p = 0.02).
SIGNIFICANCE: Female cHRA returned to levels of gait function and activity 
similar to healthy controls unlike female THA.

BACKGROUND: A challenge often faced by people with lower extremity amputation is 
management of prosthetic socket fit due to changes in fluid volume within their 
residual limb. Prior research suggests that intermittently doffing the 
prosthetic socket may help stabilize daily residual limb fluid volume.
METHODS: To assess the effects of partial doff duration on residual limb fluid 
volume retention, participants with transtibial amputation were tested by 
walking on a treadmill in a controlled, laboratory setting under three 
conditions. An automated system to release the locking pin and enlarge the 
socket was used to produce the partial doffing. Percent limb fluid volume 
changes after partial doffing for 4 min (Short Rest) and for 10 min (Long Rest) 
were compared with no partial doffing (No Release). Limb fluid volume was 
monitored using bioimpedance analysis.
FINDINGS: Mean percent fluid volume changes in the posterior region were  -1.2% 
for No Release, 2.7% for Short Rest, and 1.0% for Long Rest. Short and Long 
Rests had larger increases than No Release (P = 0.005 and 0.03, respectively); 
Short and Long Rests were not statistically different (P = 0.10). Eight of the 
thirteen participants experienced a higher percent fluid volume gain for both 
release protocols while four experienced a higher percent fluid volume gain for 
only one release protocol.
INTERPRETATION: A partial doff duration as short as 4 min may be an effective 
strategy to stabilize limb fluid volume in prosthesis users with transtibial 
amputation. Trials in at-home settings should be pursued.

& Human Performance Laboratory, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of walking in 
reduced lighting with or without performing a secondary cognitive task on gait 
dynamics in middle-aged adults and to compare them with young and old adults.
METHODS: Twenty young (age 28.8±4.1), 20 middle-aged (age 50.2±4.4), and 19 
elderly (age 70.7±4.2) subjects participated in the study. Subjects walked on an 
instrumented treadmill at a self-determined pace under four conditions in 
randomized order: (1) walking in usual lighting (1000 lumens); (2) walking in 
near-darkness (5 lumens); (3) walking in usual lighting with a serial-7 
subtraction dual-task; and (4) walking in near-darkness with a serial-7 
subtraction dual-task. Variability in stride time and variability in the 
trajectory of the center of pressure in the sagittal and frontal planes 
(anterior/posterior and lateral variability) were measured. Repeated measures 
ANOVA and planned comparisons were used to determine the effects of age, 
lighting conditions, and cognitive task on each gait outcome.
RESULTS: Under usual lighting, stride time variability and anterior/posterior 
variability of the middle-aged subjects were similar to those of the young and 
lower than those of the old. The lateral variability of the middle-aged subjects 
was higher than that of young adults under both lighting conditions. Similar to 
the older adults, the middle-aged participants increased their stride time 
variability when walking in near-darkness, but they were the only ones to 
exhibit increased lateral variability and anterior/posterior variability in 
near-darkness. Young adult gait was not affected by lighting, and concurrent 
performance of a cognitive task while walking did not affect gait stability in 
all groups under any of the lighting conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Gait stability decreases in middle age when walking in the dark. 
Recognition of functional deficits in middle age could promote appropriate 
interventions to optimize aging and reduce fall risk.

Intramuscular high-frequency coherence is increased during visually guided 
treadmill walking as a consequence of increased supra-spinal input. The 
influence of walking speed on intramuscular coherence and its inter-trial 
reproducibility need to be established before adoption as a functional gait 
assessment tool in clinical settings. Here, fifteen healthy controls performed a 
normal and a target walking task on a treadmill at various speeds (0.3 m/s, 
0.5 m/s, 0.9 m/s, and preferred) during two sessions. Intramuscular coherence 
was calculated between two surface EMG recordings sites of the Tibialis anterior 
muscle during the swing phase of walking. The results were averaged across 
low-frequency (5-14 Hz) and high-frequency (15-55 Hz) bands. The effect of 
speed, task, and time on mean coherence was assessed using three-way repeated 
measures ANOVA. Reliability and agreement were calculated with the intra-class 
correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman method, respectively. Intramuscular 
coherence during target walking was significantly higher than during normal 
walking across all walking speeds in the high-frequency band as obtained by the 
three-way repeated measures ANOVA. Interaction effects between task and speed 
were found for the low- and high-frequency bands, suggesting that task-dependent 
differences increase at higher walking speeds. Reliability of intramuscular 
coherence was moderate to excellent for most normal and target walking tasks in 
all frequency bands. This study confirms previous reports of increased 
intramuscular coherence during target walking, while providing first evidence 
for reproducibility and robustness of this measure as a requirement to 
investigate supra-spinal input.Trial registration Registry

Sensitivity and specificity of using exercise heart rate in a thermoneutral 
environment to predict heat tolerance status.

Author information:

Nutritional Sciences).

OBJECTIVES: Following heat illness, a return to activity may require passing a 
heat tolerance test (HTT). However, there are several logistical limitations to 
the widespread use of the HTT. Thus, it would be advantageous to develop a test 
that could be conducted in a thermoneutral (~22°C) environment to predict heat 
tolerance status. The purpose of the current study was to determine the 
sensitivity and specificity of using the criteria of a heart rate (HR) ≥130 bpm 
following 30 min of thermoneutral exercise in detecting heat-intolerant and 
heat-tolerant individuals.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-five subjects visited the lab on 3 separate days. 
The first visit consisted of completing a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) test 
to assess cardiovascular fitness. For lab visits 2 and 3, subjects randomly 
completed a 2-hour walking treadmill test in either a hot (40°C, 40% relative 
humidity [RH]) or thermoneutral (22°C, 40% RH) environment.
RESULTS: Forty-eight subjects were classified as heat-intolerant and 17 subjects 
as heat-tolerant. Using the criterion of a HR ≥130 bpm at 30 min of exercise in 
the thermoneutral environment, specificity (54%) and sensitivity (100%) of 
passing the HTT was calculated. Secondary analysis using multiple regression 
revealed 3 significant variables for predicting ending HR during the HTT. They 
were: 1) absolute VO2 max (l/min), 2) age, and 3) HR at 30 min of exercise 
during thermoneutral exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise in a thermoneutral environment had a positive predictive 
value of 100%, thus, if a subject has a HR ≥130 bpm at 30 min of exercise in a 
thermoneutral environment, they are very likely to fail a subsequent 2-hour HTT 
in the heat and be classified as heat-intolerant. Therefore, prior screening has 
the potential to save time and money, along with providing safety to a 
heat-intolerant subject. Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2023;36(2):192-200.

BACKGROUND: The role of autophagy and autophagy-related genes in peripheral 
arterial disease (PAD) remains unknown and may be of diagnostic and prognostic 
value. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between 
autophagy and PAD, and identify potential diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers 
for medical practice.
METHODS: Differentially expressed autophagy-related genes in PAD were explored 
from GSE57691 and validated in our WalkByLab registry participants by 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The level of 
autophagy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of WalkByLab 
participants was assessed by analyzing autophagic marker proteins (beclin-1, 
P62, LC3B). Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used to 
evaluate the immune microenvironment within the artery wall of PAD patients and 
healthy persons. Chemokine antibody array and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
were used to assess the chemokines in participants' plasma. Treadmill testing 
with Gardner protocol was used to evaluate participants' walking capacity. 
Pain-free walking distance, maximum walking distance, and walking time were 
recorded. Finally, a nomogram model based on logistic regression was built to 
predict impaired walking performance.
RESULTS: A total of 20 relevant autophagy-related genes were identified, and 
these genes were confirmed to be expressed at low levels in our PAD 
participants. Western blotting demonstrated that the expression of autophagic 
marker proteins beclin-1 and LC3BII were significantly reduced in PAD patients' 
PBMCs. ssGSEA revealed that most of the autophagy-related genes were strongly 
correlated with immune function, with the largest number of associated genes 
showing interaction between cytokine-and-cytokine receptors (CCR). In this 
context, the chemokines growth-related oncogene (GRO) and neutrophil activating 
protein2 (NAP2) are highly expressed in the plasma of WalkByLab PAD patients and 
were significantly negatively correlated with the walking distance assessed by 
Gardner treadmill testing. Finally, the plasma NAP2 level (AUC: 0.743) and 
derived nomogram model (AUC: 0.860) has a strong predictive potential to 
identify a poor walking capacity.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data highlight both the important role of autophagy 
and autophagy-related genes in PAD and link them to vascular inflammation 
(expression of chemokines). In particular, chemokine NAP2 emerged as a novel 
biomarker that can be used to predict the impaired walking capacity in PAD 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Perturbation-based balance training (PBT) is an emerging 
intervention shown to improve balance recovery responses and reduce falls in 
everyday life in older adults. However, perturbation interventions were 
heterogeneous in nature and need improvement. This study aims to investigate the 
effects of a PBT protocol that was designed to address previously identified 
challenges of PBT, in addition to usual care, on balance control and fear of 
falling in older adults at increased risk of falling.
METHODS: Community-dwelling older adults (age ≥ 65 years) who visited the 
hospital outpatient clinic due to a fall incident were included. Participants 
received PBT in addition to usual care (referral to a physiotherapist) versus 
usual care alone. PBT consisted of three 30-minute sessions in three weeks. 
Unilateral treadmill belt accelerations and decelerations and platform 
perturbations (shifts and tilts) were applied during standing and walking on the 
Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN, Motek Medical BV). This 
dual-belt treadmill embedded in a motion platform with 6 degrees of freedom is 
surrounded by a 180° screen on which virtual reality environments are projected. 
Duration and contents of the training were standardised, while training 
progression was individualised. Fear of falling (FES-I) and balance control 
(Mini-BESTest) were assessed at baseline and one week post-intervention. Primary 
analysis compared changes in outcome measures between groups using Mann-Whitney 
U tests.
RESULTS: Eighty-two participants were included (PBT group n = 39), with a median 
age of 73 years (IQR 8 years). Median Mini-BESTest scores did not clinically 
relevantly improve and were not significantly different between groups 
post-intervention (p = 0.87). FES-I scores did not change in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a PBT program including multiple perturbation 
types and directions did not lead to different effects than usual care on 
clinical measures of balance control or fear of falling in community-dwelling 
older adults with a recent history of falls. More research is needed to explore 
how to modulate PBT training dose, and which clinical outcomes are most suitable 
to measure training effects on balance control.

Targeting enhancing the use of the paretic leg during locomotor practice might 
improve motor function of the paretic leg. The purpose of this study was to 
determine whether application of constraint force to the nonparetic leg in the 
posterior direction during overground walking would enhance the use of the 
paretic leg in people with chronic stroke. Fifteen individuals after stroke 
participated in two experimental conditions, i.e., overground walking with a 
constraint force applied to the nonparetic leg and overground walking only. Each 
participant was tested in the following procedures that consisted of overground 
walking with either constraint force or no constraint force, instrumented 
split-belt treadmill walking, and pressure-sensitive gait mat walking before and 
after the overground walking. Overground walking practice with constraint force 
resulted in greater enhancement in lateral weight shift toward the paretic side 
(P < 0.01), muscle activity of the paretic hip abductors (P = 0.04), and 
propulsion force of the paretic leg (P = 0.05) compared with the results of the 
no-constraint condition. Overground walking practice with constraint force 
tended to induce greater increase in self-selected overground walking speed (P = 
0.06) compared with the effect of the no-constraint condition. The increase in 
propulsion force from the paretic leg was positively correlated with the 
increase in self-selected walking speed (r = 0.6, P = 0.03). Overground walking 
with constraint force applied to the nonparetic leg during swing phase of gait 
may enhance use of the paretic leg, improve weight shifting toward the paretic 
side and propulsion of the paretic leg, and consequently increase walking 
speed.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Application of constraint force to the nonparetic leg 
during overground walking induced improved lateral weight shifts toward the 
paretic leg and enhanced muscle activity of the paretic leg during walking. In 
addition, one session of overground walking with constraint force might induce 
an increase in propulsive force of the paretic leg and an increase in 
self-selected overground walking speed, which might be partially due to the 
improvement in motor control of the paretic leg.

Kidney transplant waitlist management is complex because waiting time is long, 
and the patients have significant comorbidities. Identification of patients at 
highest risk for waiting list removal for death and medical complications could 
allow better outcomes and allocation of resources.
METHODS: Demographics, functional and frailty assessment' and biochemical data 
were retrospectively analyzed on 313 consecutive patients listed for kidney 
transplant. Troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, components of the Fried frailty 
metrics, pedometer activity, and treadmill ability were measured at the time of 
transplant evaluation and at subsequent re-evaluations. Cox proportional hazards 
models were used to identify factors associated with death or waiting list 
removal for medical reasons. Multivariate models were created to identify 
significant predictor sets.
RESULTS: Among 249 patients removed while waitlisted, 19 (6.1%) died and 51 
(16.3%) were removed for medical reasons. Mean follow-up duration was 2.3 y 
(±1.5 y). 417 sets of measurements were collected. Significant (P < 0.05) 
non-time-dependent variables associated with the composite outcome identified on 
univariate analysis included N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (BNP), 
treadmill ability, pedometer activity, diagnosis of diabetes and the Center of 
Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale question asking how many days per week 
could you not get going. Significant time-dependent factors included BNP, 
treadmill ability, Up and Go, pedometer activity, handgrip, 30 s chair sit-stand 
test, and age. The optimal time-dependent predictor set included BNP, treadmill 
ability, and patient age.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes in functional and biochemical markers are predictive of 
kidney waitlist removal for death and medical reasons. BNP and measures of 
walking ability were of particular importance.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: During adolescence, an interplay between biological and 
environmental factors leads to constrained sleep duration and timing. The high 
prevalence of sleep deprivation during this developmental period is a public 
health concern, given the value of restorative sleep for mental, emotional, and 
physical health. One of the primary contributing factors is the normative delay 
of the circadian rhythm. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the 
effect of a gradually advanced morning exercise schedule (30 min shift each day) 
completed for 45 min on 5 consecutive mornings, on the circadian phase and 
daytime functioning of adolescents with a late chronotype, compared with a 
sedentary control group.
METHODS: A total of 18 physically inactive male adolescents aged 15-18 years 
spent 6 nights at the sleep laboratory. The morning procedure included either 45 
min walking on a treadmill or sedentary activities in dim light. Saliva dim 
light melatonin onset, evening sleepiness, and daytime functioning were assessed 
during the first and last night of laboratory attendance.
RESULTS: The morning exercise group had a significantly advanced (earlier) 
circadian phase (27.5 min ± 32.0), while sedentary activity resulted in a phase 
delay (-34.3 min ± 53.2). Morning exercise also led to higher evening sleepiness 
in the earlier hours of the night, but not at bedtime. Mood measures improved 
slightly in both study conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the phase-advancing effect of 
low-intensity morning exercise among this population. Future studies are needed 
to test the transference of these laboratory findings to adolescents' real life.

Objective.The evaluation of animals' motion behavior has played a vital role in 
neuromuscular biomedical research and clinical diagnostics, which reflects the 
changes caused by neuromodulation or neurodamage. Currently, the existing animal 
pose estimation methods are unreliable, unpractical, and 
inaccurate.Approach.Data augmentation (random scaling, random standard deviation 
Gaussian blur, random contrast, and random uniform color quantization) is 
adopted to augment image dataset. For the key points recognition, we present a 
novel efficient convolutional deep learning framework (PMotion), which combines 
modified ConvNext using multi-kernel feature fusion and self-defined stacked 
Hourglass block with SiLU activation function.Main results.PMotion is useful to 
predict the key points of dynamics of unmarked animal body joints in real time 
with high spatial precision. Gait quantification (step length, step height, and 
joint angle) was performed for the study of lateral lower limb movements with 
rats on a treadmill.Significance.The performance accuracy of PMotion on rat 
joint dataset was improved by 1.98, 1.46, and 0.55 pixels compared with 
deepposekit, deeplabcut, and stacked hourglass, respectively. This approach also 
may be applied for neurobehavioral studies of freely moving animals' behavior in 
challenging environments (e.g.Drosophila melanogasterand openfield-Pranav) with 
a high accuracy.

The mediolateral ground reaction force (M-L GRF) profile that realizes a 
symmetrical mediolateral ground reaction impulse (M-L GRI) between both limbs is 
essential for maintaining a straight movement path. We aimed to examine the M-L 
GRF production across different running speeds in unilateral transfemoral 
amputees (TFA) to identify strategies for maintaining straight running. The 
average medial and lateral GRF, contact time (tc), M-L GRI, step width, and 
center of pressure angle (COPANG) were analyzed. Nine TFAs performed running 
trials at 100% speed on an instrumented treadmill. Trials were set at 30-80% 
speed with an increment of 10%. Seven steps from the unaffected and affected 
limbs were analyzed. Overall, the unaffected limbs exhibited a higher average 
medial GRF than the affected limbs. The M-L GRI were similar between both limbs 
at all speeds, implying that the participants were able to maintain a straight 
running path. The affected limb exhibited a longer tc and a lower M-L GRF 
profile than the unaffected limb. The results showed that unilateral TFAs 
adopted limb-specific strategies to maintain a straight running path, and that 
these limb-specific strategies were consistent across different running speeds.

(1) Background: Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability. To identify 
the best treatment strategies for people with stroke (PwS), the aim of the 
current study was to compare the effects of training on a treadmill with 
functional electrical stimulation (TT-FES) with training on a treadmill (TT), 
and to analyze the effects of sequence of training on mobility and the 
parameters of walking ability. (2) Methods: Prospective, longitudinal, 
randomized and crossover study, in which 28 PwS were distributed into groups, 
namely the A-B Group (TT-FES followed by TT) and B-A Group (TT followed by 
TT-FES), using the foot drop stimulator, and were measured with functional 
tests. (3) Results: We found improved mobility, balance, non-paretic limb 
coordination, and endurance only in the group that started with TT-FES. However, 
sensorimotor function improved regardless of the order of training, and paretic 
limb coordination only improved in the B-A Group, but after TT-FES. These data 
indicate that the order of the protocols changed the results. (4) Conclusions: 
Although biomechanical evaluation methods were not used, which can be considered 
a limitation, our results showed that TT-FES was superior to isolated training 
on a treadmill with regard to balance, endurance capacity, and coordination of 
the non-paretic limb.

People with schizophrenia (SCZ) have a shorter life expectancy than those 
without psychiatric conditions. Of note, people with SCZ have high rates of 
cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity. These factors all coalesce 
to contribute to compromised health in this population, with smoking as a 
primary contributor. Therefore, it is paramount to develop effective smoking 
cessation strategies for this population. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate whether walking at a brisk pace, relative to engaging in passive 
activity, would reduce acute cigarette craving, nicotine withdrawal, and 
negative affect (NA) among people with SCZ who smoke cigarettes. Using a 
within-subjects design, twenty participants completed four laboratory sessions 
with condition sequence counterbalanced: 1) exposure to smoking cues + treadmill 
walking, 2) exposure to neutral cues + treadmill walking, 3) exposure to smoking 
cues + passive/sedentary activity, 4) exposure to neutral 
cues + passive/sedentary activity. Relative to sedentary activity, walking 
resulted in greater decreases in nicotine withdrawal but did not significantly 
affect craving or NA. These results did not vary as a function of cue type. 
These findings suggest that walking may be a helpful strategy to reduce acute 
nicotine withdrawal symptoms among people with SCZ. However, it should be used 
in conjunction with other strategies for smoking cessation.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of an intensive interdisciplinary 
programme in improving goal and motor outcomes for preschool-aged children with 
non-progressive neurodisabilities. The primary hypothesis was that the 
intervention would be feasible.
DESIGN: A single group feasibility study.
SETTING: An Australian paediatric community therapy provider.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty children were recruited. Inclusion criteria were age 2-5 
years with a non-progressive neurodisability, Gross Motor Function 
Classification System (GMFCS) levels III-V or equivalent, and goals relating to 
mobility, communication and upper limb function. Exclusion criteria included 
orthopaedic surgery in the past 6 months, unstable hip subluxation, uncontrolled 
seizure disorder or treadmill training in the past month.
INTERVENTION: A goal-directed programme of three 2-hour sessions per week for 
4 weeks (24 hours total). This consisted of treadmill and overground walking, 
communication practice, and upper limb tasks tailored by an interdisciplinary 
team.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Limited-efficacy measures from 
preintervention (T1) to postintervention (T2) and 4-week follow-up (T3) included 
the Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), Canadian Occupational Performance Measure 
(COPM), Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66) and 10-Metre Walk Test (10MWT). 
Acceptability, demand, implementation and practicality were also explored.
RESULTS: There were improvements at T2 compared with T1 for all limited-efficacy 
measures. The GAS improved at T2 (mean difference (MD) 27.7, 95% CI 25.8 to 
29.5) as well as COPM performance (MD 3.2, 95% CI 2.8 to 3.6) and satisfaction 
(MD 3.3, 95% CI 2.8 to 3.8). The GMFM-66 (MD 2.3, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.5) and 10MWT 
(median difference -2.3, 95% CI -28.8 to 0.0) improved at T2. Almost all 
improvements were maintained at T3. Other feasibility components were also 
demonstrated. There were no adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: An intensive interdisciplinary programme is feasible in improving 
goal and motor outcomes for preschool children with neurodisabilities (GMFCS 
III-V or equivalent). A randomised controlled trial is warranted to establish 
efficacy.

This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy of motor adaptation during 
walking on a split-belt treadmill (SBT) under different learning conditions in 
adults with stroke. We searched randomized clinical trials and case studies that 
used SBT under different learning conditions published between January 2011 and 
April 2022 in four databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Brain-URJC. 
The following data were extracted: objectives, interventions, population, number 
of sessions, outcome measures, and results. The methodological quality of 
quantitative studies was evaluated using the Critical Review Form. We identified 
79 studies, from which six met the criteria for this systematic review (four 
randomized clinical trials and two case series). The six selected studies 
included 156 patients with chronic stroke; 62.8% men, age 21-85 years. Walking 
on a SBT can generate artifacts in the gait pattern depending on the 
experimental conditions. Two series of cases and one trial reported that the 
dual motor task - the inclination of the slope of the SBT or the gradual change 
of speed - promotes the retention of the artifacts generated by the 
disturbances, resulting in the learning of a new motor pattern. However, 
combining physical exercise of different intensity and at different times with 
SBT, maximizing or minimizing errors, or including variable or constant speed 
disturbances do not seem to affect the locomotor adaptation process.

BACKGROUND: Adaptive gait involves the ability to adjust the leading foot in 
response to the requirement of dynamic environments during walking. Accurate 
adjustments of the minimum toe clearance (MTC) height and step length can 
prevent older people from falling when walking and responding to hazards. 
Although older people with diabetes fall more frequently than healthy older 
adults, no previous studies have quantified their adaptive gait abilities. This 
study aimed to investigate the effects of diabetes mellitus on step length and 
MTC height adjustments using a non-immersive virtual-reality system.
METHODS: Sixteen young adults (26 ± 5 years, 7 females), 16 healthy older adults 
(68 ± 5 years, 6 females), and 16 older adults with diabetes (70 ± 5 years, 6 
females) completed adaptability tests while walking on a treadmill. A computer 
system visualised a continuous real-time signal of absolute step length and MTC 
on a monitor. Each person responded to four discrete participant-specific step 
length and MTC visual targets that were presented on the same signal. Tasks were 
to match the peaks of interest on each signal to presented targets. Targets were 
10% longer or shorter than the mean baseline step length, and 2.5 cm, and 3.5 cm 
higher than the mean baseline MTC. When a target was displayed, it remained 
unchanged for 10 consecutive foot displacement adaptation attempts. Then, the 
target was removed and a new target or the same target was present after 10 
consecutive steps and remained for 10 steps. Each target was randomly presented 
three times (3 × 10). Step length and MTC height adjustments in response to 
targets were measured and compared among groups.
RESULTS: Mean preferred walking speeds were not different among groups 
significantly when no targets were presented on the monitor in baseline walking. 
However, when participants walked on a treadmill while attempting to match step 
lengths or MTC heights to displayed targets on the monitor, the group with 
diabetes had reduced step length and MTC adjustments compared with other 
groups significantly. They showed greater errors (differences between their step 
lengths/MTC heights and presented targets) on the monitor.
CONCLUSIONS: This study quantified reduced abilities for older individuals with 
diabetes to adjust both step length and MTC in response to stimuli compared to 
healthy older counterparts. Reduced step length and MTC height adjustments can 
increase falls in at risk populations. The presented virtual-reality system has 
merits for assessing and training step and MTC adaptation.

OBJECTIVES: To establish preliminary gait training dosage parameters for 
patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI) by determining the within-session 
and between-session effects of auditory biofeedback training on center of 
pressure (COP) location during gait.
DESIGN: Observational Longitudinal.
SETTING: Laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: 19 participants with CAI, 8 participants who did not receive 
auditory biofeedback (NoFeedback group) and 11 participants who did receive 
auditory biofeedback (AuditoryFeedback group) over an 8-session 2-week 
intervention.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COP location was measured at the start and at each 5-min 
interval during treadmill walking across all eight 30-min training sessions.
RESULTS: The AuditoryFeedback group had significant within-session 
lateral-to-medial shifts in COP location during only session-1 at the 15-min 
(45% of stance; peak mean difference = 4.6 mm), 20-min (35% and 45%; 4.2 mm), 
and 30-min time intervals (35% and 45%; 4.1 mm). Furthermore, the 
AuditoryFeedback group had significant between-session lateral-to-medial shifts 
in COP location at session-5 (35-55% of stance; 4.2 mm), session-7 (35%-95%; 
6.7 mm), and session-8 (35%-95%; 7.7 mm). The NoFeedback group had no 
significant changes in COP location within-sessions or between-sessions.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants with CAI who received auditory biofeedback during gait 
needed an average of 15-min during session-1 to meaningfully shift their COP 
location medially and 4-sessions before retaining the adapted gait pattern.

BACKGROUND: Dual Task (DT) walking in everyday life is the norm rather than the 
exception. Complex cognitive-motor strategies are employed during DT and it is 
necessary to coordinate and regulate neural resources to ensure adequate 
performance. However, the underlying neurophysiology involved is not fully 
understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the neurophysiology 
and gait kinematics during DT gait.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Our main research question was whether gait kinematics 
changed during DT walking for healthy young adults and whether this is reflected 
in brain activity.
METHODS: Ten healthy young adults walked on a treadmill, performed a Flanker 
test while standing and performed the Flanker test while walking on a treadmill. 
Electroencephalography (EEG), spatial temporal, and kinematic data was recorded 
and analyzed.
RESULTS: Average alpha and beta activities were modulated during DT walking 
compared to single task (ST) walking while ERPs during the Flanker test showed 
larger P300 amplitudes and longer latencies for DT compared to standing. Cadence 
reduced and cadence variability increased during DT compared to ST whilst 
kinematic results showed that hip and knee flexions decreased, and the center of 
mass moved slightly back in the sagittal plane.
SIGNIFICANCE: It was found that healthy young adults employed a cognitive-motor 
strategy that included directing more neural resources to the cognitive task 
while adopting a more upright posture during DT walking.

BACKGROUND: Most people with Parkinson's disease (PD) walk with a smaller 
mediolateral base of support (BoS) compared to healthy people, but the 
underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Reduced trunk motion in people with PD 
might be related to this narrow-based gait. Here, we study the relationship 
between trunk motion and narrow-based gait in healthy adults. According to the 
extrapolated center of mass (XCoM) concept, a decrease in mediolateral XCoM 
excursion would require a smaller mediolateral BoS to maintain a constant margin 
of stability (MoS) and remain stable.
RESEARCH QUESTION: As proof of principle, we assessed whether walking with 
reduced trunk motion results in a smaller step width in healthy adults, without 
altering the mediolateral MoS.
METHODS: Fifteen healthy adults walked on a treadmill at preferred comfortable 
walking speed in two conditions. First, the 'regular walking' condition without 
any instructions, and second, the 'reduced trunk motion' condition with the 
instruction: 'Keep your trunk as still as possible'. Treadmill speed was kept 
the same in the two conditions. Trunk kinematics, step width, mediolateral XCoM 
excursion and mediolateral MoS were calculated and compared between the two 
conditions.
RESULTS: Walking with the instruction to keep the trunk still significantly 
reduced trunk kinematics. Walking with reduced trunk motion resulted in 
significant decreases in step width and mediolateral XCoM excursion, but not in 
the mediolateral MoS. Furthermore, step width and mediolateral XCoM excursion 
were strongly correlated during both conditions (r = 0.887 and r = 0.934).
SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that walking with reduced trunk motion leads to a 
gait pattern with a smaller BoS in healthy adults, without altering the 
mediolateral MoS. Our findings indicate a strong coupling between CoM motion 
state and the mediolateral BoS. We expect that people with PD who walk 
narrow-based, have a similar mediolateral MoS as healthy people, which will be 
further investigated.

Heel riser height and slope gradient influence the physiology of ski 
mountaineering-A laboratory study.

In ski mountaineering it is the goal to reach the top of a mountain by sheer 
muscle force. The specific equipment (flexible boot, only toe fixated binding, 
and a skin on the ski to prevent from slipping backwards) enables the skier to 
move up the hill ergonomically, where the heel part of the binding offers a 
special adaptation possibility. The so-called riser height supports the heel 
standing height and can be adjusted to individually preferred settings. General 
recommendations suggest using lower heel support in flat ascents and higher heel 
support in steep ascents to maintain upright posture and lower the strain. 
Still, it remains unclear whether the application of riser height affects the 
physiological response during ski mountaineering. This study was designed to 
investigate the effects of riser height on physiological response during indoor 
ski mountaineering. Nineteen participants took part in the study and walked on a 
treadmill with ski mountaineering equipment. The three available riser heights 
(low, medium, and high) were applied randomized at 8%, 16%, and 24% gradient. 
Results show that global physiological measurements like heart rate (p = 0.34), 
oxygen uptake (p = 0.26) or blood lactate (p = 0.38) values were not affected by 
changes in riser height. But local measurements of muscle oxygen saturation were 
affected by the riser height. Additionally comfort and rating of perceived 
exertion were also prone to changes in riser height. These results suggest 
differences on local measurements and perceived parameters, while global 
physiological measurements did not change. The results are in line with the 
existing recommendations but need to be confirmed in an outdoor setting as well.

CONTEXT: The Pritikin Program, which provides intensive lifestyle therapy, has 
been shown to improve cardiometabolic outcomes when provided as a residential 
program.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to conduct a short-term, 
randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility and clinical efficacy 
of treatment with the Pritikin Program in an outpatient worksite setting.
METHODS: Cardiometabolic outcomes were evaluated in people with 
overweight/obesity and ≥2 metabolic abnormalities (high triglycerides, low 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, high blood pressure, HbA1c > 5.7%), 
before and after they were randomized to 6 weeks of standard care (n = 26) or 
intensive lifestyle therapy, based on the Pritikin Program (n = 28). 
Participants in the lifestyle intervention group were provided all food as 
packed-out meals and participated in group nutrition, behavioral education, 
cooking classes, and exercise sessions 3 times per week at a worksite location.
RESULTS: Compared with standard care, intensive lifestyle therapy decreased body 
weight (-5.0% vs -0.5%), HbA1c (-15.5% vs +2.3%), plasma total cholesterol 
(-9.8% vs +7.7%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-10.3% vs +9.3%) and 
triglyceride (-21.7% vs +3.0%) concentrations, and systolic blood pressure 
(-7.0% vs 0%) (all P values < .02), and increased exercise tolerance (time to 
exhaustion walking on a treadmill by +23.7% vs +4.5%; P < .001).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility and clinical effectiveness 
of short-term, intensive outpatient lifestyle therapy in people with 
overweight/obesity and increased risk of coronary heart disease when all food is 
provided and the intervention is conducted at a convenient worksite setting.

BACKGROUND: Ultrasonography is capable of detecting morphological changes in 
femoral articular cartilage cross-sectional area in response to an acute bout of 
walking; yet, the response of femoral cartilage cross-sectional area varies 
between individuals. It is hypothesized that differences in joint kinetics may 
influence the response of cartilage to a standardized walking protocol. 
Therefore, the study purpose was to compare internal knee abduction and 
extension moments between individuals with anterior cruciate ligament 
reconstruction who demonstrate an acute increase, decrease, or unchanged medial 
femoral cross-sectional area response following 3000 steps.
METHODS: The medial femoral cartilage in the anterior cruciate ligament 
reconstructed limb was assessed with ultrasonography before and immediately 
following 3000 steps of treadmill walking. Knee joint moments were calculated in 
the anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed limb and compared between groups 
throughout the stance phase of gait using linear regression and functional, 
mixed effects waveform analyses.
FINDINGS: No associations between peak knee joint moments and the 
cross-sectional area response were observed. The group that demonstrated an 
acute cross-sectional area increase exhibited 1) lower knee abduction moments in 
early stance in comparison to the group that exhibited a decreased 
cross-sectional area response; and 2) greater knee extension moments in early 
stance in comparison to the group with an unchanged cross-sectional area 
response.
INTERPRETATION: The propensity of femoral cartilage to acutely increase 
cross-sectional area in response to walking is consistent with less-dynamic knee 
abduction and knee extension moment profiles.

Cognitive dual tasks alter gait of younger and older adults and recent research 
has demonstrated that they also influence gaze behaviour and standing postural 
control. These findings suggest that age-related changes in cognitive and gaze 
function might increase fall risk in older adults. The purpose of this study was 
to determine the effect cognitive and visual dual tasks on the gait and gaze 
behaviour of younger and older adults. Ten older and ten younger adults walked 
for 3 min on a treadmill at preferred walking speed under three conditions, 
single task, cognitive and visual dual task conditions. Gait dynamics were 
measured using accelerometry and gaze behaviour was measured using wearable 
eye-trackers. Stride time variability and centre of mass (COM) motion complexity 
increased in dual-task conditions in older adults but had no difference for 
younger adults. Dual tasks had limited effect on gaze behaviour; however, visual 
input duration was greater, and visual input frequency and saccade frequency 
were lower in older than younger adults. The gaze adaptations in older adults 
may be the result of slower visual processing or represent a compensatory 
strategy to suppress postural movement. The increase in gait COM motion 
complexity in older adults suggests the dual tasks led to more automatic gait 
control resulting from both cognitive and visual tasks.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that in patients with peripheral arterial 
disease (PAD) and claudication, treated with maximal tolerated statin therapy, 
the addition of a monthly subcutaneous injection of evolocumab for 6 months 
improves treadmill walking performance.
BACKGROUND: Lipid lowering therapy improves walking parameters in patients with 
PAD and claudication. Evolocumab decreases cardiac and limb adverse events in 
patients with PAD; however, the effect of evolocumab on walking performance is 
not known.
METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to 
compare maximal walking time (MWT) and pain free walking time (PFWT) in patients 
with PAD and claudication treated with monthly subcutaneous injections of 
evolocumab 420 mg (n = 35) or placebo (n = 35). We also performed measurements 
of lower limb perfusion, brachial flow mediated dilatation (FMD), carotid intima 
media thickness (IMT), and serum biomarkers of PAD disease severity.
RESULTS: After six-months of treatment with evolocumab MWT increased by 37.7 % 
(87.5 ± 24 s) compared to 1.4 % (-21.7 ± 22.9 s) in the placebo group, p = 0.01. 
PFWT increased by 55.3 % (67.3 ± 21.2 s) in the evolocumab group compared to 
20.3 % (8.5 ± 20.3 s) in the placebo group, p = 0.051. There was no difference 
in lower extremity arterial perfusion measurements. FMD increased by 
42.0 ± 73.9 % (1.01 ± 0.7 %) in the evolocumab group and decreased by 
16.29 ± 20.06 % (0.99 ± 0.68 %) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). IMT decreased 
by 7.16 ± 4.6 % (0.06 ± 0.04 mm) in the evolocumab group and increased by 
6.68 ± 4.9 % (0.05 ± 0.03 mm) in the placebo group, (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of evolocumab to maximal tolerated statin therapy 
improves maximal walking time in patients with PAD and claudication, increases 
FMD, and decreases IMT.
CONDENSED ABSTRACT: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) impairs quality of life by 
causing lower extremity intermittent claudication, rest pain, or amputation. 
Evolocumab is a monthly injectable monoclonal antibody medication that reduces 
cholesterol. In this study, we randomly treated patients with PAD and 
claudication, and on background statin therapy, with evolocumab or placebo, and 
found that evolocumab improves walking performance on a treadmill test by 
increasing maximal walking time. We also found that evolocumab decreases plasma 
MRP-14 levels, a marker of PAD severity.

demands in older adults.

PURPOSE: Voluntary gait adaptability is a complex construct that requires 
cognitive demands and dynamic balance control; it also has implications for the 
daily lives of older adults. This ability has been extensively studied, however, 
a comprehensive overview of appropriate tasks for measuring voluntary gait 
adaptability in older adults is lacking. Our scoping review aimed to identify 
existing voluntary gait adaptability tasks for older adults, summarize the 
specific methodological features requiring cognitive demands found in previous 
studies, and categorize these tasks according to experimental procedure and 
setup.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using six databases 
(PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Embase). This 
included studies that investigated voluntary gait adaptability in older adults 
(≥ 65 years old) with and without neurological disorders, with a focus on 
experimental tasks requiring cognitive function (e.g., response to visual or 
auditive stimuli) while walking.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included; most involved visual stimuli, such as 
obstacles, stairs, or colored cues, and few required auditory stimuli. The 
studies were categorized according to the experimental procedure, for example, 
ascent/descent of obstacles (n = 3), inconsistent surfaces (n = 1), lateral gait 
adjustment (n = 4), obstacle avoidance (n = 6), and stepping tasks (n = 2), as 
well as experimental setup, including instrumented treadmills (n = 3), stairs (n 
= 3), and walkways (n = 10).
CONCLUSION: The results show wide heterogeneity between studies regarding 
experimental procedures and setup. Our scoping review highlights the need for 
additional experimental studies and systematic reviews on voluntary gait 
adaptability in older adults.

Joint and Limb Loading during Gait in Adults with ACL Reconstruction: Comparison 
between Single-Step and Cumulative Load Metrics.

PURPOSE: Individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) 
generally exhibit limb underloading behaviors during walking, but most research 
focuses on per-step comparisons. Cumulative loading metrics offer unique insight 
into joint loading as magnitude, duration, and total steps are considered, but 
few studies have evaluated if cumulative loads are altered post-ACLR. Here, we 
evaluated if underloading behaviors are apparent in ACLR limbs when using 
cumulative load metrics and how load metrics change in response to walking speed 
modifications.
METHODS: Treadmill walking biomechanics were evaluated in 21 participants with 
ACLR at three speeds (self-selected (SS); 120% SS and 80% SS). Cumulative loads 
per step and per kilometer were calculated using knee flexion and adduction 
moment (KFM and KAM) and vertical ground reaction force (GRF) impulses. 
Traditional magnitude metrics for KFM, KAM, and GRF were also calculated.
RESULTS: The ACLR limb displayed smaller KFM and GRF in early and late stances, 
but larger KFM and GRF during midstance compared with the contralateral limb ( P 
< 0.01). Only GRF cumulative loads (per step and per kilometer) were reduced in 
the ACLR limb ( P < 0.01). In response to speed modifications, load magnitudes 
generally increased with speed. Conversely, cumulative load metrics (per step 
and per kilometer) decreased at faster speeds and increased at slow speeds ( P < 
0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ACLR underload their knee in the sagittal plane per 
step, but cumulatively over the course of many steps/distance, this underloading 
phenomenon was not apparent. Furthermore, cumulative load increased at slower 
speeds, opposite to what is identified with traditional single-step metrics. 
Assessing cumulative load metrics may offer additional insight into how load 
outcomes may be impacted in injured populations or in response to gait 
modifications.

The current study aimed to investigate exercise with blood flow restriction 
(BFR) as a low-intensity conditioning strategy in tactical professionals with 
load carriage. During the low-intensity exercise, researchers examined the acute 
metabolic responses from low-intensity BFR walking, walking with load carriage, 
and walking with BFR and load carriage. Twelve healthy adult males (age = 21.8 ± 
1.5 yrs, height = 181.3 ± 7.2 cm, body mass = 84.4 ± 11.1 kg and BMI = 25.6 ± 
2.6 kg·m2) completed five bouts of 3-min treadmill walking at 4.8 km·h-1 with 
1-min rest interval under three different conditions: 1) blood flow restriction 
(BFR), 2) loaded with 15% of body mass (LOAD) and 3) loaded with 15% of body 
mass with blood flow restriction (BFR-LOAD). Oxygen consumption (V̇O2), heart 
rate, and local muscle oxygen saturation was measured during the exercise bouts. 
V̇O2 increased by 7% during the BFR- LOAD (p = 0.001) compared with BFR or LOAD 
alone. There were no differences in V̇O2 between BFR and LOAD (p = 0.202). 
BFR-LOAD showed significantly lower (-9%) muscle oxygen saturation (p = 0.044) 
and deoxygenated hemoglobin (p = 0.047) compared to LOAD. Low-intensity walking 
with the addition of BFR shares acute metabolic characteristics similar to 
walking with a load. These characteristics suggest there is potential for the 
use of BFR to increase exercise intensity for individuals training with load 
carriage.
